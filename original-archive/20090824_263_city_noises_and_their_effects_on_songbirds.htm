		<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this counts, but there is a woodpecker that frequently pecks a telephone pole in my backyard and I would swear that he is pounding out a bossa nova.</p>

		<p>The Australian Lyrebird, known for faithfully mimicking other birds, is pretty amazing at mimicking non-bird sounds, including car alarms (from the official BBC youtube channel): <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjE0Kdfos4Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjE0Kdfos4Y</a></p>

		<p>That bird can mimick camera shutters, camera shutter + motor film advance, and chainsaws. That is one amazing bird. I wonder how much research is being done into HOW a bird can make such unnatural sounds&#8230;</p>

		<p>There was a blackbird (the old-world kind, Turdus merula) that was hanging around my mothers house a couple of years ago that would frequently use telephone signals as the ending sequence of its song. I got just as startled each time I heard it.</p>

		<p>I believe there&#8217;s a specific finch that&#8217;s adept at learning songs from their environment. &nbsp;As a result I&#8217;ve wanted to collect a few, segregate them so each one hears a different techno beat then after they&#8217;re all adept at repeating their part put them back together to make a techno bird chorus.</p>

		<p>I used to have a parakeet who&#8217;s perch sat only a few feet away from a MicroVAX server. The VAX had a scheduled mail process on it that ran regularly every hour or so, and produced a very consistent drive chatter as it processed the logs.</p>
<p>The parakeet quickly learned to mimic the drive chatter of the VAX running the mail. It would often chatter along with the server. Even years later when the server was long gone, the bird continued to &quot;sing&quot; like an old hard drive.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
