		<p>I realized that the apparent diameter was increasing as you progressed through the list.</p>
<p>But until following the link I hadn&#8217;t associated it with reported sizes of hail.</p>
<p>(Although in retrospect I have heard many of those terms used to describe hail pellet size)</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with cricket, the cricket ball pictured is about the same size as a tennis ball.</p>
<p>The whole area I lived in looked like a driving range after that.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been to several NWS weather spotter classes and the instructor always directs spotters to never use &nbsp;&quot;marble&quot; to describe the size hail. To prove the point, the instructor brings out a bag marbles to show that their size can very from 1/2&quot; to 7/8&quot;. This makes it impossible to determine whether the hail is severe (&gt; 3/4&quot;).</p>
<p>The instructor recommends always using coin sizes to report hail size.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve never heard &quot;hen egg&quot; or &quot;tea cup&quot; used to describe hail, but everything else is familiar.</p>
<p>When people around here (Midwest) say &quot;marble&quot; they&#8217;re usually thinking about the 1/4&quot; variety. &nbsp;That&#8217;s one of those cases where most people understand what is meant even though there are a large number of variations.</p>

		<p>I realized what it was when I got to &#8216;baseball&#8217; and &#8216;softball&#8217;, but then I spent some time in Kansas, and baseball-sized hail was in the news this week (texas?)</p>
<p>The worst hail I saw was golfball. It was extremely noisy, but only about one hailstone per second fell in a 4&#215;4 meter area. So if one were totally stupid, one could walk through the hailstorm with a very decent chance of being unharmed.</p>

		<p>The US currency centric list includes Teacup while the British one doesn&#8217;t&#8230; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8230;.the Brits also appear keen on providing options&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;.Mothballs were the biggest hailstones I saw in 36 yrs in the UK, &nbsp;I guess more remote parts of the Empire saw some Melons&#8230;.</p>

		<p>Wendy: over here in the west midlands, just over a year ago, we had some that I&#8217;d classify as walnuts. &nbsp;But, yeah, other than that I&#8217;d agree with not getting much beyond &#8216;mothball&#8217;. &nbsp;Most of the hail I see is too small to even classify as &#8216;pea&#8217;.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
