A customer was using memory-mapped files and installed an

They wanted to know how they could obtain the real disk error

<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363082(VS.85).aspx">

    The first element of the array
    contains a read-write flag that indicates
    the type of operation that caused the access violation.
    If this value is zero, the thread attempted
    to read the inaccessible data. If this value is 1,
    the thread attempted to write to an inaccessible address.
    If this value is 8, the thread causes a user-mode data
    execution prevention (DEP) violation.

    The second array element specifies the virtual address

<p>Apparently you didn&#39;t read the doc either. AND you are off topic.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the documentation you will find &quot;Send comments about this topic to Microsoft&quot;</p>
<p>Use that to send your proof reading feedback.</p>

		<p>By the way, for the first parameter for which 8 means execution, there are named constants in WinNT.h. &nbsp;It is a platform-specific value, so you should probably use them instead of the literal 8.</p>
<p>#define EXCEPTION_READ_FAULT 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// exception caused by a read</p>
<p>#define EXCEPTION_WRITE_FAULT 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // exception caused by a write</p>

		<p>When reading the doc part that Raymond copied I wondered why DEP would cause an EXCEPTION_IN_PAGE_ERROR, but Myria&#39;s comment explains it. The doc is wrong (as usual).</p>

		<p>A bit overly nit-picky on the MSDN doco above&#8230;real issue is devs who haven&#39;t learned how to search on the Internet. MSDN had all info needed. &nbsp;As for ”untrustworthy computing” you&#39;re probably one of those devs whose love of undocumented APIs and avoidance of best practice recommendations results in code making you worthy of title ”untrustworthy computing”</p>

		<p>@Malcolm: wow&#8230; Ad hominem much? How about growing up a bit?</p>
<p>Or perhaps these are your psychic powers in action? You don&#39;t *need* to know anything about a person other than whether they feel they can trust the msdn documentation, in order to determine that they love to avoid best practice recommendations and undocumented APIs. I am impressed. Perhaps you could also give us next week&#39;s lottery numbers?</p>
<p> The comments above may be too pedantic for your liking, but most of us expect documentation to, well, document things. That is, documentation should implicitly be *correct*. </p>

		<p>@Ricardo C: Perhaps Dave used &quot;Send comments about this topic to Microsoft&quot;. You cannot know. I certainly know I did use it multiple times in hope the docs shall be corrected or made unambiguous. However I never got any feedback except some auto-generated generic e-mail and the docs was never corrected. So why should we use it if no one listens on the other side?</p>

		<p>&quot;MSDN had all info needed. &nbsp;As for ”untrustworthy computing” you&#39;re probably one of those devs whose love of undocumented APIs and avoidance of best practice recommendations results in code making you worthy of title ”untrustworthy computing”&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not always that simple. &nbsp;Consider just this scenario:</p>
<p> * The Windows taskbar uses Aero Peek to allow the user to &quot;peek&quot; at other Windows. &nbsp;(Aero Peek screenshot at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.philoking.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/aeropeek1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.philoking.com/&#8230;/aeropeek1.jpg</a> if you forgot what that is)</p>
<p> * Windows &lt;= 7 does not directly support having multiple taskbars on a multi-monitor system (i.e. one taskbar per monitor).</p>
<p> * Windows does not expose the API needed for Aero Peek as a public API.</p>
<p> * In fact, Raymond explicitly said that Aero Peek was NOT publicly exposed to prevent abuse: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/10/27/10081263.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/10081263.aspx</a></p>
<p> * So now there is an array of different 3rd-party software vendors who add auxiliary taskbars to additional monitors due to the absence of this feature from Microsoft. &nbsp;They would have to use an undocumented API to invoke this effect: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6450223/windows-aero-peek-api" rel="nofollow">stackoverflow.com/&#8230;/windows-aero-peek-api</a></p>
<p>The API was added to support the new Windows 7 taskbar, but the Windows 7 taskbar did not add taskbars to other monitors. &nbsp;So the market has created these auxiliary taskbar software packages, but they can&#39;t support the same Aero Peek effect that the default taskbar does unless they start using undocumented APIs.</p>
<p>I would guess that the developers of these packages have to dip into a lot of other undocumented APIs as well. &nbsp;It is interesting to note that Microsoft has finally admitted that these multiple taskbars are a useful feature after all and are adding the feature to Windows 8. &nbsp;Only 14 years after the introduction of multiple monitor support in Windows 98, but better late than never, I guess! &nbsp;I would imagine Microsoft might never have considered this feature had other developers not used undocumented APIs to create these auxiliary taskbars.</p>
<p>Personally, I can&#39;t function properly on a multi-monitor system without multiple taskbars. &nbsp;Once I have a couple dozen windows open scattered across multiple monitors, I get completely lost if Windows is trying to shoehorn them onto one taskbar (which window was on which monitor again?).</p>

		<p>&quot;The second array element specifies the virtual address of the inaccessible data.&quot;</p>
<p>But in the example &quot;ExceptionInformation[2];&quot;, it&#39;s accessing the 3rd. Or am I misinterpreting something?</p>

		<p>@vcsjones: Because the example is interested in the error code (&quot;The third array element specifies the underlying NTSTATUS code that resulted in the exception.&quot;). The name of the variable on the left side should hint you in that direction (DiskError = GetExceptionInformation()-&gt;ExceptionRecord-&gt;ExceptionInformation[2];) as also the article text (&quot;They wanted to know how they could obtain the real disk error&quot;).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
