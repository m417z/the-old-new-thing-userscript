<p><a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/thewendyhouse/"> The friend who</a> brought to my attention the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/10/129069.aspx"> guide to British pub etiquette</a> reports that Portsmouth's Millennium Tower, centerpiece of the Millennium Project, is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/southampton/webcams/spinnaker_tower.shtml"> still not finished</a>, due for completion (scroll to the end of the article) in May 2005.</p>
<p> To disguise the embarrassment, they've renamed it to Spinnaker Tower, thereby&mdash;as the <a href="http://www.hago.org.uk/">Hampshire Area Guitar Orchestra</a> describes it&mdash;replacing <a href="http://www.hago.org.uk/2000/popup/forget-2.html"> a name that no-one could quite remember how to spell correctly, with a name that no-one can quite remember how to spell correctly</a>". </p>
<p> If you go back <a href="http://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/living/752.html"> to the original proposal</a>, construction was to begin in Winter 1998 with completion in Autumn 1999. In reality, the project was so badly delayed that construction didn't even begin until 2003 (I believe). Quite an embarrassment to what was supposed to be "Millennium City". (At least it's no longer home to the <a href="http://www.rmaz.co.uk/tricorn.html">Tricorn Carpark and Shopping Centre</a>, named <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3561069.stm"> Britain's ugliest building</a>.) </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.millennium-city.co.uk/"> If you go to the project's home page</a>, you can catch up on everything that's going on, or at least pretend to, because the "News Update" and "The Projects" links are both 404. </p>
<p> But that's okay, because there'll be "More Deatils Soon". </p>

		<p>I have to say, it looked a lot more completed than any of those pictures show, when I visited the Isle of Wight earlier this month. but then again, it does appear to have hit even more finical problems in February.</p>

<p>As for the spelling, blame 50 years of &quot;comprehensive&quot; education in Big Government Socialist schools!</p>

		<p>There is another &quot;millennium&quot; project in Bath, UK featuring a new spa. The local council have pumped millions in and apart from an opening ceremony featuring the three tenors several years ago, they&#8217;ve reached stalemate with the developers and the project still isn&#8217;t finished. </p>
<p>Here is the latest in the saga:<br />
<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/4454125.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/4454125.stm</a></p>
<p>It seems that many people got a little bit too excited with the millenium projects &#8211; look at the millenium dome in London! Did anywhere else in the world have such problems or is it just us Brits?</p>

		<p>I live in Southampton, and visit Portsmouth quite regularly with my girlfriend. The area near Spinnaker Tower is quite nice, it&#8217;s such a shame that they haven&#8217;t finished off developing the tower. :)</p>
<p>But then, that&#8217;s what they get for being Portsmouth &#8211; Southampton is evidently the better city.</p>

<p>Undoubtably true, apart from the rather embarassing 4-1 defeat we suffered at the hands of those Pompey scummers yesterday.  I don&#8217;t really follow football, but I still don&#8217;t like being beaten by a bunch of pikey chavs&#8230;</p>
<p>Spinnaker Tower has the unfortunate property of being near both a giant landfill and the Budd&#8217;s Farm sewage treatment centre; I quite often drive past it when travelling between offices, and if the sun is up and the wind is blowing in the wrong direction it gets somewhat fragrant.</p>

		<p>I can see the magnificent incomplete Spinnaker Tower from my office window as I type this. Another problem is that some of the concrete used to construct the tower was found to be sub-standard, leading to the possibility that the tower might not be around for very long. And I liked the Tricorn, it had character.</p>

		<p>&#8216;And the development cost all came out of your council tax&#8217; &#8211; Many councils in the early 90s must have spent some of their tax take on software from Microsoft or Apple, and thus funded the development of Taligent etc. But my point was that you don&#8217;t need to be a big socialist government to make grandiose promises and then deliver them years late or not at all.</p>

		<p>I have fond memories of wandering through the Tricorn&#8230;   &#8230;.it was exciting,  Will I be:<br />
<br />&#8211; speared by a falling stalechtite?<br />
<br />&#8211; guano-bombed by one of the resident Seagulls?<br />
<br />&#8211; mugged by the person who&#8217;s footsteps I can hear echoing through the maze-like spaces.</p>
<p>Not to mention my first &quot;Laser-Quest&quot; game where the staff of University of Portsmouth Engineering Department (regular lazer-quest players),  challenged the staff of the uninitiated Portsmouth Psychology Dept to a match.  While the engineers won the game,  the two highest scorers were both pre-menstrual women on the Psynchology team who had never played before&#8230;</p>
<p>It was one of those places you build rich and varied life experiences&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
