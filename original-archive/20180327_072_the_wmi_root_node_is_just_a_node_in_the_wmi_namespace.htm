A security vulnerability report arrived that went
roughly like this:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q">
<p>
There is a serious zero-day security vulnerability in
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742610.aspx">
the <code>WMIC.EXE</code> program</a>.
It does not check whether the user has administrative privileges
before granting access.
Simply sign in as a standard user and run the
<code>wmic</code> program.
Observe from the prompt that it gives you root access.
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; del config.sys
Access is denied

C:\&gt; wmic
wmic:root\cli&gt; cdrom get description, drive
Description   Drive
CD-ROM Drive  D:
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The WMIC prompt looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
wmic:root\cli&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This is telling you that your current location
(which WMI calls a <i>role</i> for some reason)
is the <code>cli</code>
node in the root of the WMI namespace.
You can change this by typing
</p>
<pre>
wmic:root\cli&gt; /ROLE:..\cimv2
wmic:root\cimv2&gt;
</pre>
<p>
We suspect that the finder saw the word <i>root</i>
and assumed it had the same meaning here as it does in Unix.
In Windows, the administrator account is called <i>Administrator</i>,
not <i>root</i>.
</p>
<p>
Their screen shot shows that they don't have administrator privileges
when they started (because they can't delete the file
<code>C:\config.sys</code>).
From inside the <code>WMIC</code> tool, they printed information about
the CD-ROM drives, but that operation doesn't require administrator
privileges,
so that isn't proof that any elevation occurred.
</p>
<p>
Running the <code>WMIC</code> program doesn't change
your security level.
If you don't have administrator privileges,
then you still cannot do things like, say, delete
system files.
</p>
<pre>
wmic:root\cli&gt;datafile where name="C:\\config.sys" delete
Delete '\\PC\ROOT\CIMV2:CIM_DataFile.Name="c:\\config.sys"' (Y/N/?)? y
Deleting instance \\PC\ROOT\CIMV2:CIM_DataFile.Name="c:\\config.sys"
ERROR:
Description = Access denied

		<p>I suspect that the phrase &#8220;zero-day&#8221; in a security vulnerability report to a vendor strongly correlates with &#8220;has no idea what they&#8217;re talking about.&#8221; I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s either being used to make it sound more impressive, or they&#8217;re just cargo culting the report.</p>

		<p>I filed a zero day vulnerability before that the vendor (not MS) was one.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s funny, a few years ago I had a root canal, and it stripped me of all my godlike powers. So, he&#8217;s right &#8211; root does mean the same thing everywhere</p>

		<p>This post is tagged as &#8220;Other&#8221;. But this post is one of the many whose subject is &#8220;security vulnerability false positives&#8221;. Would be great if they all could be tagged as such.</p>

		<p>If I had somehow submitted that vulnerability report, I would probably die of shame.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
