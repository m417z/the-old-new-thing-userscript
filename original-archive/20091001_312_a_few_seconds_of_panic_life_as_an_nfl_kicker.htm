<p>Although I don't follow him regularly when he appears on <i>All Things Considered</i> and didn't when he wrote for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, I'm a quiet fan of Stefan Fatsis's books because he writes about joining a world most of us don't get to see. I previously wrote about his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/04/14/113053.aspx"> excursion into the world of competitive Scrabble</a>. Today, it's his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594201781?tag=tholneth-20"> <i>A Few Seconds of Panic</i></a>, or more formally, <i>A Few Seconds of Panic: A 5-Foot-8, 170-Pound, 43-Year-Old Sportswriter Plays in the NFL</i>, another example of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/03/5249867.aspx"> <i>Catchy title: Long boring subtitle</i></a> book title fad. [Update: Now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143115472?tag=tholneth-20"> available in paperback</a>.] Fatsis convinces a professional football team to let him join them for a pre-season game as a place kicker. From there, he observes the working of an NFL team from the inside. NPR's <i>Only a Game</i> interviewed him in August 2008. [<a href="http://www.bu.edu/wbur/storage/2008/08/onlyagame_0823_7.mp3">mp3</a>]</p>
<p> (Fatsis is a regular member of Slate's new weekly sports podcast <a href="http://www.slate.com/rss/feed.aspx?id=2224225"> <i>Hang Up and Listen</i></a>. He mentions his kicking career only every other podcast now.) </p>
<p> (And I wasted far too much time on what is rumored to be another Stefan Fatsis production, <a href="http://nameoftheyear.blogspot.com/"> <i>Name of the Year</i></a>. Here's a list of <a href="http://nameoftheyear.blogspot.com/2007/02/year-by-year-noty-winners.html"> previous winners</a>.) </p>

		<p>Slightly off-topic: in your Scrabble entry, someone somehow managed to write a comment quite a while after the comments were turned off. Weird.</p>

		<p>@Old New Thing: Thanks for the reviews. Appreciate it. One thing: The NFL book is out in paperback &#8212; with a much shorter subtitle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143115472/" rel=nofollow target=_new rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143115472/</a></p>
<p>@GWO. George Plimpton did this already? No way! If you bothered reading even an excerpt or a review, readily available online, you&#8217;d see that my book is an homage to Plimpton. I&#8217;d say that the NFL has changed rather a lot since Plimpton went to Lions camp in 1963, wouldn&#8217;t you? And if a writer could actually get inside the league as a player, might that not be a pretty unusual opportunity? Fans and media think they understand sports &#8212; the blessing and curse of our 24/7 media &#8212; but in reality they don&#8217;t. I had a chance to do something no one had done in 40+ years, and deliver readers a view they just don&#8217;t ever get. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s much easier to be a smart ass than to actually think about something.</p>

<p>Indeed it is. I think that&#8217;s why being a smart ass is so popular- It&#8217;s easy.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
