<p>It turns out that the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/05/25/2854508.aspx"> replacement movie</a> wasn't any of the ones I listed. Instead, I decided to see  <a href="http://www.seattlefilm.org/festival/film/detail.aspx?id=23473&amp;fid=32"> <i>In the Shadow of the Moon</i></a>, a mid-week performance in Seattle. Since it was also a fantastically warm sunny day, traffic into Seattle was a nightmare. As the bus crawled along the highway, I had to do some mental calculations. I'm definitely going to miss my connecting bus downtown (the number 4 at 6:05pm); what's the best recovery plan? It turns out that my decision, in retrospect, was the correct one, but it was merely a lucky guess.</p>
<p> I arrived downtown at 6:17pm, intending to transfer to the&nbsp;3 or&nbsp;4 bus to Seattle Center, home of the SIFF Cinema theater. I was just too late for the 6:15pm bus, and right at the start of the transition from peak service to off-peak service. The next bus was at 6:35pm, which would put me at Seattle Center at around 6:45. Add in time for walking from the bus stop to the theater and waiting in line to pick up my tickets, and that puts me dangerously close to missing the 7pm show. </p>
<p> I briefly considered getting off at REI and taking the&nbsp;8, but I didn't know how often it ran, and if I missed, I would be out in the middle of nowhere. (Turns out the&nbsp;8 runs every half hour, and the next bus was the 6:35, which would have gotten me to Seattle Center at 6:45, no better than the safer plan of taking the&nbsp;3 or&nbsp;4.) </p>
<p> Aha, <a href="http://www.seattlemonorail.com/"> the Monorail</a> runs every ten minutes. It's 6:17. Even in the worst case, I'm still way ahead. (They don't publish a timetable. You just buy your ticket and take your chances.) </p>
<p> Turns out it was the worst case. I arrived at the ticket booth just as the doors closed. But the next one arrived at 6:27, as promised, and just a few minutes later, I was at the Space Needle. A brisk walk to the SIFF Cinema theater and I had plenty of time to pick up my ticket and get in line. </p>
<p> I've lived in the Seattle area for over fifteen years, and this was my first Monorail ride. </p>

The first half of the movie was vignettes of a small town in Romania. They were sometimes interesting, sometimes tedious (do we really have to follow a car for two minutes as it drives through the streets of town?), and they felt like filler and "backstory" for the main story. If you showed up 45 minutes late and just caught the call-in program, you'd still get 90% of the enjoyment of the movie. One brief plot line from the first half of the movie comes back in the second; aside from that, you really didn't miss much. I give it a 2 out of 5 based on the strength of the second half. </p>

The build-up was well-done, and the twist at the end makes you mentally rewind the movie and replay it in your head so you can view the motivations of one of the characters in a different light. I give it a 4 out of 5, gaining points from the wonderful squash game, but losing points because the canyoneering trip was a bit too convenient from a storytelling point of view. </p>

(Of the astronauts, all of whom are extremely well-spoken and quite funny, Michael Collins steals the show.) If this movie goes into general release, I strongly encourage every space buff to run, don't walk, to see it. The footage of the Saturn&nbsp;V launch brought tears to me eyes. I give it a 5 out of 5. </p>
<p> There's a spectacular shot taken from the inside of a spent stage: You watch the next stage ignite and the spacecraft fade off into the distance, then as the spent stage loses attitude, the earth comes into view before the film finally runs out. During the Q&amp;A after the movie, one person asked the director, "How did the film of that sequence survive re-entry?" The answer: The film was ejected from the spent stage and fell to earth. High-altitude planes were in pursuit with giant nets trailing out behind them. That was one insane game of "catch". </p>
<p> The special surprise guest at the screening was Bill Anders, the crewmember from Apollo&nbsp;8 who took the famous Earthrise photo. He quipped that Frank Borman actually took the first Earthrise photo, but Borman had the disadvantage of using the camera loaded with black-and-white film; Anders had color film in his camera. </p>
<p> Bonus story #1 from Gene Cernan: "My father was alive when the Wright brothers made their first flight; he could hardly believe that I walked on the moon. My son was five years old; he thought it was no big deal." </p>
<p> Bonus story #2 from Charles Duke: "After I returned, the flight doctor told me that at launch my heart rate was 144." A beat. "John's was 70." Cut to interview with John Young: "I'm old. My heart can't go any faster." </p>

		<p>I hope &quot;In the shadow of the moon&quot; comes to the UK. Would love to hear the Apollo astronaunts views on the missions and I know John Young has one hell of a sense of humour &#8211; It&#8217;s just a shame Pete Conrad died in a road accident.</p>

		<p>If there was no other reason to read your blog (and there are plenty), this post just gave me the only reason I need.</p>
<p>I will definitely be doing all I can to see In the Shadow of the Moon, which I would not have known about had I not been reading your blog for the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for bringing the existence of what sounds like a wonderful film to our attention.</p>

		<p>Catching film canisters in mid air was actually routine in the 60s. &nbsp;The plane would snag the parachute lines, not the canister itself. &nbsp;This is how spy satellites sent photos to earth until digital sensors and downlinks got good enough.(<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://samadhi.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/Programs/corona.html" rel="nofollow">http://samadhi.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/Programs/corona.html</a>)</p>
<p>My favorite feature was that the canisters were made to float, but with a salt plug that disolved after a day or two so that the canister would sink. &nbsp;That kept lost top secret canisters from washing up on beaches, or being found by the Russians.</p>

		<p>I saw In the Shadow of the Moon at Sundance this year and agree that it was awesome. &nbsp;My favorite story was Aldrin talking about his &quot;first&quot; on the moon when he gets to the end of the ladder and pauses to take care of some personal business.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, you could jog the distance from the Westlake Center to Seattle Center in 10 minutes or less.</p>

		<p>Sydney has a monorail as well. It was built in 1988 for the bicentenary. I rode it once in 1988 and then never again, until almost 20 years* later when I rode it a couple of months ago. It&#8217;s pretty cool &#8211; you pay $4.50 and while you&#8217;re technically only supposed to go one loop (I don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;d police that, though &#8212; you lose your token in the machine when you get on, so how do they know how many times you&#8217;ve gone around?) The loop takes 15 minutes or so, so it&#8217;s fun to go around a couple of times before you get off :-)</p>
<p>Not sure how (of even *if*) they make money out of it, though.</p>
<p>* OK, 19 years. But 19 *is* &quot;almost&quot; 20&#8230;</p>

		<p>I suppose the cable cars in San Francisco are occasionally used for transportation, too. &nbsp;Maybe even the horse-drawn carriages around Central Square, during the New York transit strike &#8230;</p>
<p>Just think, in another 20 years we&#8217;ll finally have solved our public transportation problem around Seattle. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll be able to take the light rail all the way from Microsoft Redmond Campus to Seattle Center (albeit via I-90).</p>

		<p>My entire life in Seattle, yet to ride the monorail. &nbsp;I walk under it quite often when going from Downtown to the Cinerama, but I have never actually been on it!</p>

		<p>When I read that headline I immediately though about the Simpsons.</p>
<p>The second thought was: Great, Raymond finally references the Simpsons. There was this note on the wikipedia page some time that Raymond might have written episode guides on snpp.com about Simpsons.</p>

		<p>Hopefully Shadow Of The Moon becomes available on DVD so I can add it to my collection alongside From The Earth To The Moon and Apollo 13</p>

		<p>As a certain someone at the same showing that Raymond was at mentioned, the movie Apollo 13 was a soap opera compared to In the Shadow of the Moon. &nbsp;You really must see it, Jonathan.</p>

		<p>Netflix seems pretty certain that it will come out on DVD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/70059639" target=_new rel=nofollow rel="nofollow">http://www.netflix.com/Movie/70059639</a></p>
<p>Also, if you&#8217;re interested there is a really good book called Moondust where the author does some informal &#8220;catching up&#8221; with the Apollo astronauts. &nbsp;Good, quick reading although the depth found in some other books might be lacking (i.e. don&#8217;t bury me if it isn&#8217;t techincal enough).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
