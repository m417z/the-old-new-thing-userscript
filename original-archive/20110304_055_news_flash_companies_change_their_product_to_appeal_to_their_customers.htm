		<p>The worst is when a company changes a product you enjoy for the worse. The most famous example of this is probably the New Coke/Coke Classic ordeal. It seems that all too often I find a product that I really like only to have it changed in some way. Somehow, the horrible old standbys keep struggling along without changing their formula at all.</p>

		<p>This is also a 3-year old news flash. From TFA: &quot;Originally published Thursday, July 17, 2008 at 12:00 AM&quot;</p>
<p>Regarding New Coke &#8211; there&#39;s an old conspiracy theory about how Coke did New Coke on purpose, knowing it would flop, knowing that when they re-introduced Classic they&#39;d get a surge of business that put them further ahead of Pepsi, who was at the time taking considerably market share from Coke. Whether it was on purpose or not, sometimes the best way to succeed is to fail.</p>

		<p>The New Coke incident was almost certainly not intentional &#8212; who would be stupid enough to risk that much? The reason it happened was that Diet Coke, which was Coke in name only (it was an entirely new formulation), was becoming reasonably popular. Executives figured that they could capitalize on that popularity and boost their flagging sales by replacing the old, tired Coke formula with a sugary version of Diet Coke.</p>
<p>Of course they quickly learned that people drank Diet Coke because it was diet, not because it was Coke. Coke then had to bury New Coke and bring back the original formula and call it &quot;Coke Classic&quot; so that people would know that it was the real stuff, not the impostor.</p>
<p>The up-shot is that Coke sales went higher than ever before when people realized what they missed, and we got the &quot;Classic&quot; idiom which can be applied to anything to indicate &quot;the original&quot; in relation to a newer version.</p>
<p>Bonus chatter: Coke Zero is the diet version of Coke Classic.</p>

<p>This reminds me of one of my favorite messages from the MS unit testing framework: &quot;Assert.Fail() failed.&quot;</p>
<p>Wait&#8230;what? What do I do about this? From here, it looks like Assert.Fail succeeded. Have I failed to fail or failed to succeed or succeeded at failing? Ouch, my brain hurts.</p>

		<p>J: You should read history a bit better. Coke switched to 50% HFCS five years before new coke, and 100% HFCS six months before. It was already there.</p>

		<p>As far as I&#39;m aware, the New Coke stuff *was* deliberate, and it was to cover the switch from sucrose to HFCS in the classic coke formula. Release New Coke, people don&#39;t like it, say you&#39;re switching back to the classic recipe (but don&#39;t tell anyone you&#39;re using HFCS instead of sucrose), and customers don&#39;t even notice that it tastes subtly different from what it was.</p>

		<p>And there are places where oke still uses honest sugarcane sugar rather than HFCS&#8230; Just that US and Canada have subsidized corn so much that corn derivatives are really cheap.</p>

		<p>The thing about New Coke is that in blind audience trials, people generally preferred the new coke taste to that of old coke. People were just too resistant to change.</p>

		<p>I should also add: The taste of cola varies significantly around the world. In the UK I would class the Coke Zero taste as more akin to that of competitor Pepsi than any of the other Coke products. Diet Pepsi, on the other hand, I would class as their flavor most similar to Coke</p>

		<p>@Owen Shepherd &#8212; the taste trial thing is probably a blind alley. &nbsp;New Coke was actually designed to improve response to taste trials, that&#39;s basically what it was engineered for (because Pepsi was killing Coke in taste trials). &nbsp;The problem is that taste trials identify what people like the flavour of, but people don&#39;t necessarily actually like to drink the same thing&#8230; New Coke was sweeter than Classic, and people like small quantities of sweet things (like you get in a taste trial) but for larger quantities prefer things that are less sweet.</p>

		<p>@Tim: Coca-cola uses sugar from time to time in some of their products instead of HFCS, such as during passover when there is kosher Coca-Cola available in some markets, in some stores in those markets. &nbsp;I know some grocery stores in Atlanta used to carry this. &nbsp;So they haven&#39;t switched &quot;100%&quot; to HFCS.</p>

		<p>There&#39;s also the Pepsi Throwback line (which may just be Pepsi and Mt. Dew) if you want real sugar instead of HFCS. &nbsp;Or you can get Mexican-manufactured soft drinks which also use real sugar instead of HFCS.</p>

		<p>@David: You and Igor were talking about the same thing. Around Passover, Coke releases kosher for Passover soda, and indicates it by means of the yellow cap. Yellow caps are rare any other time of year (surplus stock from Passover generally), and if there aren&#39;t a lot of Jews in your area, the local store might not sell them (so being Passover is no guarantee of real sugar). Like he said, the yellow cap is the key.</p>

		<p>So, if you like Coca-Cola made with sugar, just make sure you live in a market where Coca-Cola offers cola at Passover, and stock up when you see the yellow cap!</p>

		<p>It appears that I&#39;ve steered this post into a New Coke tangent. Here in Vancouver, I find there are several independent grocery stores that offer Coca-Cola produced in Mexico. In my opinion, this is several times better than what you normally find.</p>

		<p>I guess I should consider myself fortunate to live in a place that has many Jewish neighborhoods (so I can find Passover Coke in the Spring), has a local bottler that uses sucrose (so I can sometimes find regular Coke made without HFCS), and has a store nearby that sells bottles of Mexican Coke. The Mexican Coke is the best because it comes in glass bottles, but since they require a bottle opener they are not easy to drink on-the-go.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
