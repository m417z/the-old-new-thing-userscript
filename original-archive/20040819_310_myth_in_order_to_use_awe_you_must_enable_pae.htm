		<p>Caveat: I don&#8217;t know anything about PAE and AWE. And I believe you when you say that they are it&#8217;s not required.</p>
<p>However, proving that one test case works does not prove that it works for the general case or that there are subtle problems that will occur over time.</p>

		<p>Well, it is documented that AWE does require PAE.  &quot;Without PAE, AWE cannot reserve memory in excess of 4 GB.&quot; [1]</p>
<p>So, I wouldn&#8217;t call it a myth.</p>

		<p>It doesn&#8217;t say that AWE requires PAE. It says that AWE requires PAE in order to allocate more than 4GB of physical memory. But that&#8217;s just stating the obvious. You need PAE in order to access more than 4GB of physical memory, AWE or no AWE.</p>

		<p>I wrote that article, so yeah, it should agree with exactly with what Raymon says. If it doesn&#8217;t let me know, and it will be fixed post haste. and I blame any inaccuracies on editors who change things I write after the fact. </p>

		<p>And is there a valid use for AWE without PAE?</p>

		<p>The same uses as with it, I would imagine. </p>
<p>And one of the most benficial things is, developers can test AWE apps without having to enable PAE.</p>

		<p>One use is if you want to allocate non-swappable memory.</p>

		<p>Can&#8217;t it use PSE to access beyond 4GB using 4M pages above that area? I thought PSE was meant for that, but didn&#8217;t succeed because the 4M pages were not as usable as Intel had hoped. The top few bits were in the bottom of the address part that wasn&#8217;t used in the 4M page entries.</p>

		<p>I think giving these functions a fancy name (AWE) leads to confusion.  I&#8217;ve used VirtualAllocEx several times to inject code into other processes.  Never knew it was part of AWE.</p>

		<p>Please take another look at the documentation.  VirtualAllocEx is AWE only if you pass the MEM_PHYSICAL flag.</p>

		<p>True, you can&#8217;t use an experiment to prove that something will always happen, but you can use it to disprove that something *never* happens or *requires* something else.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
