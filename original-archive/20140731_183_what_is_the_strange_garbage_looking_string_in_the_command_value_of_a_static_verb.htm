<p> The customer didn't explain why they were interested in this particular registry value. Maybe they thought it was enabling some super magical powers, and they wanted to get in on that action. (If that was the case, then they failed to notice that the same <code>command</code> value also existed in the verb registration <i>for their own program</i>!) </p>
<p> That strange garbage-looking string was placed there by Windows Installer (also known as MSI). It is the so-called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302344.aspx"> Darwin descriptor</a> that Windows Installer uses to figure out what program to run when the verb is invoked by the shell. For compatibility with programs that read the registry directly (because everybody knows that reading the registry is much cooler than using the API), the default value is set to something approximating the local executable's path. That default value might be incorrect if the application has moved in the meantime, and it might be <a href="http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC85549.gif"> missing entirely</a> if the application is marked as install-on-demand and has never been used, but at least it keeps those rogue programs working 99% of the time. </p>

		<p>As for why programs read the registry for this, in the 1995 era most people were using BC4.51 as the compiler which had 3.51 documentation. The registry was discoverable. The API was not. If you didn&#39;t know to use ShellExecute you couldn&#39;t find it.</p>

		<p>Given that the registry supports binary values, it seems counterproductive to use something which looks like a Base64-encode of binary data in there.</p>

		<p>Well, the Classes key of the registry is a mere contract between applications and installers, in one side, and the shell (be it Explorer or whatever the user wants to use) in the other. As such, it&#39;s fully documented, and you just linked to it in the article (by the way, the link is broken). I find it legitimate to interpret that contract from the other side. A compressed file manager (as 7-Zip) or an alternative shell are examples of programs that may want to do that for legitimate reasons. As I see it, the default value for MSI managed applications is more than a mere compatibility fix: is necessary to comply with the specification.</p>

		<p>How did this work in the early days when MSI was not part of the OS? Did shell32.dll get updated by the MSI Redistributable or did it require a Internet Explorer upgrade as well?</p>

		<p>There is an other reason why to modify these entries: Some application that we used regularly did a &quot;Verify if the installation is still OK&quot; check (which checked file associations and entries in the start menu). Each time you started a file by double-click it would reinstall these settings to the same annoying values as during the installation (The point was that I&#39;d rather kept the original associations with a different application. And I used a customized tree structure in the start menu to avoid a single menu with dozens of entries).</p>
<p>I first just changed the file associations and my start menu manually (since the installer didn&#39;t give any options there). &#8211;&gt; However as I said, the settings mysteriously kept reappearing. Looking somewhat further I&#39;ve seen these entries (on those file associations that I kept with the old application). Deleting them solved my problem&#8230;</p>
<p>I agree that&#39;s pretty hackish solution. But at least the application stopped bothering me with &quot;I need to reinstall&quot;</p>

		<p>@Koro there is text data in there too (the program arguments).</p>
<p>Of course they could have been separate values. &nbsp;Would have been easier to parse.</p>
<p>@alegrl1 I imagine businesses find it invaluable for adminstrating program installs remotely. &nbsp;Google even provides an MSI&#39;d Chrome for businesses, as an alternative to the Google Update-installed version.</p>
<p>@Daniel This is likely why newer Windows do not allow programs to set file associations automatically through the registry any more; at least, the old keys don&#39;t work. &nbsp;Setting those associations only triggers Windows to discover that your app is an option to handle those files (and I think Windows 8 displays the notification in the corner when you open a file that has new handlers available for it).</p>

		<p>&gt; I imagine businesses find it invaluable for adminstrating program installs remotely.</p>
<p>Ability to install remotely is not a magical property of MSI packages. It&#39;s just the remote installation services (Microsoft and ISV) support it. It doesn&#39;t make MSI executive any less retarded. Besides from being, in essence, an ultra-slow table-driven glorified UNZIP, there is one thing that tells that MSI executive is very ill-designed &#8211; during installation, there is a free-running (polling?) thread, that slows everybody down.</p>

		<p>You&#39;ll see the same descriptor in COM registration that MSI creates through its Class table, and there&#39;s one hidden in MSI-created shortcuts too. After decoding into things like ProductCode and Component guid there are APIs like MsiGetComponentPath() that tell you the target, invoking repair if required.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
