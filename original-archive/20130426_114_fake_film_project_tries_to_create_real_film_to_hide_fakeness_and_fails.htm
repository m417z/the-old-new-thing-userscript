<p> In 2010, a group of scam artists <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21782944"> pretended that they were making a film</a>, appropriately titled <i>A Landscape of Lies</i>. They did this so that they could claim over &pound;2.7 million in tax credits intended to boost the British film industry. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs began to suspect something was up when no apparent progress was being made on the project and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2298937/A-Landscape-Of-Lies-Fraudsters-conned-Loose-Women-host-Andrea-McLean-3million-tax-scam-jailed.html"> the film company's "office" was an empty room</a>. The scammers tried to make the project look legitimate by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2015422/"> actually making a movie</a> for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/shortcuts/2013/mar/13/landscape-of-lies-gangster-film-tax"> &pound;84,000</a> and releasing it on DVD. (<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2298937/A-Landscape-Of-Lies-Fraudsters-conned-Loose-Women-host-Andrea-McLean-3million-tax-scam-jailed.html">You can watch the trailer here</a>.) The fake movie was convincing enough to trick one film festival into giving it an award (which it later had to <a href="http://www.contactmusic.com/news/las-vegas-film-festival-bosses-retract-award-given-to-a-landscape-of-lies_3576856"> take back</a>.) </p>

		<p>How was it a fake movie and why should it not have won an award? Sure, it was made under false pretenses, but it was in fact a real movie, so why should it not be eligible for an award? Because they are criminals, maybe, but certainly not because it&#39;s a fake movie.</p>

		<p>I guess there was some ambiguity as to whether /A Landscape of Lies/ (the movie that didn&#39;t exist) won the award or /A Landscape of Lies/ (the movie that was made to cover up the fact that /A Landscape of Lies/ didn&#39;t exist). Now you might say that obviously no award could have been given to /A Landscape of Lies/ since it didn&#39;t exist and therefore nobody could have seen it, but award committees have never been known for their rationality so it&#39;s not impossible &#8212; especially since /A Landscape of Lies/ did exist.</p>
<p>If I&#39;d been on the committee I would have given them the award anyway. But a really cheap and fake one, to cover up the fact that the actual one isn&#39;t going to be awarded.</p>

		<p>What constitutes a film being real? Could they have not shot 5 minutes of random video burned it to a DVD and called it a real film? &nbsp;Why wasnâ€™t the fake movie enough to fulfill the obligation of making a film? It was clearly real in the sense that it was a film regardless of its quality or marketability.</p>

		<p>@kog999 &#8211; well in terms of the tax scam, they&#39;d received Â£2.7 million in tax credits but only spent Â£84,000</p>

		<p>Sure, but at that point it ceases to be &quot;lying about making a movie&quot; and just becomes &quot;lying about how much they spent on the movie&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Maurits:</p>
<p>Not exactly, since they had already received the tax breaks after lying about how much investment they had and not having made a movie. That&#39;s the point when the crime was committed.</p>
<p>It was only after they were under investigation for the crime that they made the &quot;fake&quot; movie in an effort to avoid punishment.</p>

		<p>Yeah, it would be more like The Producers if they had gathered all the money (from public funding) and then just waited around to get audited before even attempting to produce Springtime for Hitler.</p>

		<p>Little kids, that&#39;s not the way to cheat, steal, get free money. Want some lessons? Come to Romania, in here the thieves are in Parliament and they make laws to cover their stealing and make it legit.</p>
<p>Want one story? In one winter my boss imported from Germany some equipment and he paid 2.5 Million EURO as custom taxes for that equipment. He was very intrigued why an entire caravan of 10 trailers stood there in no man&#39;s land between borders even they were earlier and could easy entry in the country. He find out why 2 days later when the government passed an ordinance specifying that heavy equipment are not to pay custom taxes between 24 Dec and 5 Jan. And the punch is those trailers belonged to the Internal Affairs ministry at that time. You guessed, the guy just exempted himself from paying the 24% tax. Which means that he could simply sell them fast at a lower price, making millions in just a few days.</p>
<p>Want another one? Just Google the number of members in parliament. It went up from 134 senators + 332 members for Deputy chambers to 176 / 412. Yup, in Dec 2012 they voted to increase their numbers. Free-loaders. I guess they need it the nephew to have police and special forces escort as well.</p>
<p>Another one? In 2007 Romania entered UE. Of course that means access to European funds. Guess what happens with that money. 10% are invested in real projects, 50% gets &quot;lost&quot; and 40% are audited as extra-unexpected-problems. Yup, you guessed, 90% goes to mafia.</p>
<p>Want to steal easy and never face prison? Became a Romanian citizen and run for politics, you&#39;ll live a long free of worries life.</p>

		<p>@Danny, for a replica of what you describe, you can also become (geographically from left to right through the Mediterranean Sea): Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Greek and, maybe, soon, Turkish. So, just get out of Romania to near some beach of your preference with subtropical climate, what are you waiting for? It&#39;s raining money, as long as you make the right friendships.</p>

		<p>Now all it needs is for someone within the British film industry to make a *real* film about a fake film project. They could call it, &quot;A Landscape of Lies&quot;. They might even get tax credits&#8230;</p>

		<p>@John Doe. There are 4 levels of corruptions: low (Norway, Island, Monaco), medium (most countries, UK and US included), high (usually African bananas republics are here and the so much hyped China and North Korea gets here) and Romania. Romania stands in it&#39;s own league. &nbsp;The article mentions a tax evasion of roughly 2.7 M pounds. That&#39;s the any given custom worker money he makes in Romania in a year. We got a joke here:</p>
<p>Ion (English John) birthday is approaching and his 2 good friends and custom co-workers, Vasile (no English equivalent IIRC) and Gheorghe (English George) talks about what to give as birthday present:</p>
<p>Vasile: &#8211; Hey Gheorghe, how about a Mercedes SLR latest version?</p>
<p>Gheorghe: &#8211; No way Vasile, he already got one, remember we gave one for Christmas? And for birthday we have to give a better one anyway.</p>
<p>Vasile: &#8211; How about 20 kilograms (~42 lbs) of gold?</p>
<p>Gheorghe: &#8211; Still is too little.</p>
<p>Vasile: &#8211; You know what?! We let him have our shifts at work for next week and that should be enough!</p>
<p>Gheorghe: &#8211; No way, that&#39;s too much!!</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
