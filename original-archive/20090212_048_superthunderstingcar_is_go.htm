		<p>Which is more hokey, the marionette type shows, or the super-imposed moving mouth on static prints ? (ie Clutch Cargo <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFnLirXjjto" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFnLirXjjto</a> )</p>

		<p>I once worked with someone who raised their elbows high and had their fingers crashing down on the keyboard in a rather heavy and awkward fashion. &nbsp;We described that as the Thunderbirds school of typing.</p>

		<p>I bought a Pete &amp; Dud video (VHS &#8211; remember that?) for Dad about 20 years ago &#8211; he was always a fan of theirs &#8211; and watched this soon after a rash of re-runs of Thunderbird &amp; Stingray. I don&#8217;t think I have laughed as much before or since.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s the greatest parody ever, but it&#8217;s still damn funny after all these years.</p>

		<p>Is it bad that I read that as &quot;Super-Mario-nated&quot; show? Video games stole my mind when I was younger.</p>

		<p>In their heyday (most of the 1960s), Peter Cook &amp; Dudley Moore were as popular as Monty Python were about ten years later &#8211; indeed the pythons have acknowledged them as an influence several times over.</p>
<p>Sadly, much of their material has been permanently wiped and lost forever, which is very common for BBC recordings in the 1960s, and only a few episodes of &quot;Not Only &#8230; But Also&quot; survive, which is probably the contents of the video Jeremy has. There was a color series made for ITV around 1968/69 which has also been wiped off the face of the earth. People seem to remember Derek &amp; Clive the most because these were distributed as audio LPs and were less prone to permanent erasure.</p>
<p>As well as &quot;superthunderstingcar&quot; some of my favourites are &quot;One Leg Too Few&quot; (a man with one leg applies for the role of Tarzan), &quot;Bo Duddley&quot; and &quot;The Leaping Nuns of St Beryl&quot;. Actually, the latter makes an appearance in their cult film &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (ignore the version the Americans remade about ten years ago &#8211; it&#8217;s nothing to do with it apart from the name) which you can get on DVD now.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
