<p>A project many years ago neared the conclusion of one of its project milestones. Things were getting down to the wire, and upper management was concerned that the project may not reach the milestone on schedule.</p>
<p> To ensure success, they decided to send email. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>From</b>: Senior Manager<br> <b>Subject</b>: READ NOW!!!! More than one bug </p>
<p> Please see the attached spreadsheet. If you are on the To: line you can look at the Assigned To: column and find your name. </p>
<p> You are in this spreadsheet if you have 2 or more bugs assigned to you. At this stage of the project as we are winding down and entering Milestone&nbsp;Z, people with a high number of bugs assigned to them end up being the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/05/8832510.aspx"> long poles</a> for the release. </p>
<p> We have a lot of teams getting to zero bugs, so we have people who can help you. If you need help, then ask your manager. Your manager should be on the Cc: line. It's <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/06/9284334.aspx"> key</a> we get all the bugs fixed (with quality) as soon as we can. If your manager agrees you can use help, and doesn't know where to go for help, then ask me. </p>

<p> Because as we all know, you can get people to work harder by sending email. </p>
<p> I happened to be one of the recipients of this message, and I sent back a simple reply: </p>

		<p>Sorry Raymond, but I don&#39;t see any hollow rallying cries in the senior manager&#39;s message.</p>
<p>When deadlines loom, it&#39;s OK to ask for help. It&#39;s not weakness or a sign of incompetence to ask. The manager is making that clear. Good! That&#39;s a manger&#39;s job.</p>
<p>I guess I don&#39;t see the whip cracking that you do.</p>
<p>Funny reply though.</p>

		<p>I agree with Chad. This is a perfectly reasonable message to send to a group of people who might be, consciously or not, hoarding bugs.</p>

		<p>I am quite sure that the bugs were assigned within a bug-tracking tool. Sending email with spreadsheets asking people to use another channel than the normal one causing synchronization issues is not a clever move. Developers should keep working on the bugs assigned to them, you will not get them to work faster or better by having them send email and spreadsheets around.</p>
<p>A more clever move would have been to discuss this with team leaders. They have access to the bug tracking tool and know why/who is bottleneck regardless of the number of bugs assigned.</p>
<p>And anyway, measuring load by NUMBER of bugs is silly. Some bugs take five minutes, others take days and require interaction with other unresponsive people. Managing this is the role of the team leader.</p>

		<p>&quot;I have more than one bug because my manager asked me to help out other people who have more than two. Thanks for your concern.&quot;</p>
<p>His email says &quot;We have a lot of teams getting to zero bugs, so we have people who can help you.&quot; so it would seem to me that if someone needed help your manager should have assigned someone who had zero bugs and in theory had nothing more important to do. If you had more then zero bugs you should have never been assigned to help according to the criteria of the email. I&#39;m not against this email assuming it was only sent once and you didn&#39;t get email every day or more telling you to hurry up. A single email like this shows that senior management is &quot;interested&quot; in this project and implies that its a prority. Also yes it would have been better to use the bug tracking software instead of a spreadsheet but chances are someone in senior management has no idea how to use the bug tracking software and loves their spreadsheets.</p>

		<p>This does make me laugh somewhat.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone needs to get to zero bugs!&quot; followed by &quot;If you have zero bugs, you need more bugs!&quot;</p>
<p>I suppose emails like this are helpful sometimes, you know, like if you&#39;ve forgotten you&#39;re supposed to be programming at work and not watching dancing bunnies on YouTube all day. &nbsp;Then a reminder might be nice.</p>

		<p>@kog999: Your response &#39;why assign someone with non-zero bugs to help with other bugs&#39; (paraphrased) appears assume that no bug reallocation happened before this email. &nbsp;How do you know that his manager wasn&#39;t proactive; taking someone who&#39;d reached zero bugs and reassigned him several new bugs taken from other, even more backed up, team members.</p>
<p>Side Note: since he said &quot;help out other people&quot; maybe their bug tracking system allows multiple people to be assigned to a given bug and he was tagged onto several bugs to indicate to the primary assignees that they were free to delegate work related to those bugs to him.</p>

		<p>@Ooh: You can be direct without being aggressive. &nbsp;I welcome direct communication; if you need me to do something, just say so. &nbsp;It&#39;s okay because I have my big-boy pants on and I&#39;m getting paid to work. &nbsp;And in turn, I&#39;ll be direct back, and we&#39;ll all be productive and have great communication.</p>

		<p>The thing that really bothers me about mails like this is the language. &nbsp;Notice that it never actually says &quot;you need to fix your bugs&quot;. &nbsp;Instead, &quot;you have 2 or more bugs&quot; and people like you &quot;end up being the long poles&quot;&#8230;*cough* *cough*. &nbsp;It&#39;s a very passive-aggressive writing style.</p>
<p>Also note the classic &quot;it&#39;s key *we* get all the bugs fixed as soon as *we* can&quot;. &nbsp;Invariably, despite the use of &quot;we&quot;, the sender of these emails is not someone who actually checks in code.</p>

		<p>I think the only thing that&#39;s fail in here is that the bug tracking system do not have seperate mail list of &quot;outstanding bug owners&quot; and &quot;reassigned helpers&quot;, so the manager have no choice but sending out to the bug owner list, and the mail got sent to people who have zero bug of their own but helping out the others.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
