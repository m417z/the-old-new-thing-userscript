Keytips are those little pop-up keyboard accelerator thingies
that appear on the Ribbon when you tap the Alt key:
</p>
<p><img WIDTH=355 HEIGHT=318
     SRC="http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC510585.png"></p>
<p>A tester discovered that when a test tried to read the accessibility
name for a Ribbon keytip,
"an extra character appears after every keytip character."
In the above example, the keytip for "Tab 1" was being read
back as
</p>
<pre>
46 00 0C 20 46 00 0C 20
----- ----- ----- -----
  F   ?????   F   ?????
</pre>
<p>
The question marks are U+200C,
formally known as

ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER</a>.

<a HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/15/532394.html"
  _HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2006/02/15/532394.aspx">
discussed the character (and its evil twin the
ZERO WIDTH JOINER) some time ago</a>.
</p>
<p>
The ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER (or ZWNJ to his friends)
is a hint to the font engine that
the characters on opposite sides of the ZWNJ should not be combined
into a ligature.
In English, the ZWNJ would prevent two consecutive lowercase "f"s
from being converted into a "&#xFB00;" ligature.
Ligatures are fading from use in contemporary printing,
probably due to the rise of computers. Back in the old days,
you saw all sorts of neat ligatures, like "&#xFB06;".
</p>
<p>
Breaking up the ligature is important when presenting keyboard
accelerators.
Imagine if the keyboard accelerator for a key sequence was "A"
followed by "E".
If this were displayed as "&AElig;", users would waste their
time looking for an
"&AElig;" key on their keyboard.
Although English doesn't have many ligatures any more,
<a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otfntdev/devanot/shaping.htm">
many other languages</a>
<a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/arabic/shaping.mspx">
still employ them heavily</a>.
(You may have noticed that the keytip was a bit overzealous with
the ZWNJ, putting one at the end of the string even though there
was nothing for the second F to be unjoined from!)
</p>
<p>
So if you encounter one of these ZWNJ characters, don't be afraid.
He's just there to break things up.
And as Michael notes,
ZWNJ and ZWJ "are supposed to be ignored in things like
the Unicode Collation Algortihm."</p>

		<p>Don&#39;t worry, ligatures are back in Word 2013. &nbsp;Try typing the word &quot;bloodletting.&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, ligatures are applied regardless of font size &#8212; which makes for some really awkward-looking text at large point sizes. &nbsp;I always thought that ligatures are only supposed to be used at typical reading sizes &#8212; nothing larger than, say, 14-point.</p>

<p>If somebody doesn’t use the ﬁ ligature when using Serif fonts, he is an idiot, because of the crappy dot clash. &nbsp;Copy “ﬁ fi” to your favorite WYSIWYG text editor program (Word{,Pad}/{Libre,Open}Office) with Times New Roman at a small size. &nbsp;(too big fonts/zoom may break this, and don’t forget that you can zoom paper in much better than an LCD display). &nbsp;</p>
<p>{La,}TeX, the most superior typesetting system in existence, does ligatures of certain words automatically.</p>

		<p>@alegr1 &#8211; At one point the &quot;M&quot; key on my laptop broke; I found myself needing to type rn instead to compensate, at least until I used a registry hack to remap my menu key to m. Eventually I just replaced the keyboard. ;)</p>

		<p>@Gabe: &quot;What does a multi-letter keytip mean? Do I hold down Alt while pressing the first and then the second letter? Do I only hold down Alt for the first letter? Something else?&quot;</p>
<p>In this context, they&#39;re used to display the characters that corresponded to the old menu shortcuts. E.g. in the picture above (aside: wow there&#39;s an actual picture in Raymond&#39;s post!), &quot;FB&quot; is bold because in the old UI, if you pressed Alt, then F for the Format menu, then B for Bold, you&#39;d get bold. So you could chord it as Alt, F, B; as Alt-F, B, or probably as Alt-F (continue holding Alt) Alt-B. Though I&#39;m not sure about the last and can&#39;t conveniently try.</p>
<p>[I *think* this didn&#39;t post the first time; sorry for the spam if it did.]</p>

		<p>Yes, rn-&gt;m was a joke. Not a joke is how long it took Microsoft to fix the kerning (from keming). I guess, nobody was promised a bonus for that, that&#39;s why.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
