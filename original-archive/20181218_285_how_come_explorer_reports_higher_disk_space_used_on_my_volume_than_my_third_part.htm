<p>
When you view the properties of a volume in Explorer,
it reports (among other things) disk space used and disk space
remaining.
You find that you're running low on disk space,
so you want to look for big files that could be archived and deleted,
and you run a disk space tool,
but that tool reports disk usage less than what Explorer
reports.
Where is this secret disk space usage coming from?
</p>
<p>
Explorer obtains information about used and free disk space
by calling <code>Get&shy;Disk&shy;Free&shy;Space&shy;Ex</code>,
so the information comes straight from the file system.
</p>
<p>
The third party tool is probably calculating disk space used
by walking the entire disk and adding up file sizes.
And what's probably happening is that the secret disk space
usage is coming from directories that the third party tool
cannot access.
Since it cannot access them,
it just skips over them and assumes that the directories have
no files.
</p>
<p>
In particular, it probably skips over the
<code>System Volume Information</code> directory.
System Restore snapshots are kept there,
and they can get big.
</p>
<p>
Now the tricky part: How to clean up System Restore points?
</p>
<p>
Your first inclination might be to go to the Control Panel and
search for <i>System Restore</i>, and it will take you to the
<i>System Protection</i> control panel, where you can configure
System Restore.
But the only button available there is
<i>Delete all restore points for this drive</i>.
What if you want to clean up all but the most recent restore point?
</p>
<p>
To delete all but the most recent restore point,
you have to go to a <i>completely different place</i>:
The <i>Disk Cleanup</i> utility.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, from the <i>Disk Cleanup</i> utility,
click <i>Clean up system files</i>,
and then go to the <i>More Options</i> tab.
Under the
<i>System Restore and Shadow Copies</i> section,
click <i>Clean up</i> to clean up all but the most
recent restore point.
</p>
<p>
I don't know why there isn't a link from one to the other.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
Other sources of "mystery disk space usage" are
alternate data streams and general disk metadata,
like the directories themselves!</p>

		<p>With Windows 10 build 1809 there is yet a third option, Settings -&gt; Storage -&gt; Free up space now. </p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t appear to offer access to emptying out the system restore points; should space-conscious users therefore be using all three destinations to tidy up?</p>

		<p>From what I remember from Insider builds, Disk Cleanup will be moving entirely to the Settings app and getting new features there only. The older tool should be considered deprecated now.</p>

		<p>That can be said about everything that has moved to Settings. E.g. volume mixer recently (Insider).</p>

		<p>Another fun piece of metadata is the DACL data. It&#8217;s even deduplicated so that you can&#8217;t charge it against one specific file/directory most of the time.</p>

		<p>WinDirStat will use the disk free space in addition to walking the tree. It will take the difference of the two and display a node called &#8220;Unknown Space&#8221; or something like that. Even if you run it elevated there will always be Unknown Space; probably overhead or alternate data streams or other bits you can&#8217;t count by just counting up file bytes.</p>

		<p>Also, some tools don&#8217;t cope too well when your filesystem is not a tree or even a DAG. Some of them are also confused by cross-volume links.</p>

		<p>I usually alter System Volume Information to give admins read (recursively).</p>
<p>The general result is the only thing that escapes du is a nice little feature called Volume Shadow Copy. I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s great when you want it, but it&#8217;s not so great when it starts preserving copies of periodic backups and you wonder where your disk is going. At least on/off is easy.</p>

		<p>Volume shadow copies show up there for me too, assuming that the disk space tool has been given the appropriate permissions.</p>

		<p>Free disk space is always reported as a multiple of the cluster size.</p>
<p>If you do a &#8220;dir&#8221; at a command prompt on an NTFS partition with default cluster size, you&#8217;ll find that the &#8220;bytes free&#8221; value is always divisible by 4096, even though the reported number of bytes for the file in the directory is not.</p>

		<p>&gt; The third party tool is probably calculating disk space used by walking the entire disk and adding up file sizes.</p>
<p>The question is whether this approach can provide information about the partially occupied clusters.</p>

		<p>Just a matter of asking the correct question. Just as the generic file property sheet can show both logical and effective size of files, so can your 3rd party program.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
