A customer liaison sent a question to the shell team.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>

<b>Subject</b>: <a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070118-00/?p=28353">Assistance [REG:628318530717959]</a>
</p>
<p>
Our customer has created a custom theme by editing one of the
standard High Contrast themes,
but it doesn't seem to be working quite right.
For example, Internet Explorer doesn't show Web page background images.
How can we fix this?
Details from the customer are attached.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This sounds like a customer is tinkering around doing some personalization,
and now they're using their "unlimited support" contract to get some
help to get their super-l33t theme to look even more awesome.
In the attachment, the customer explained that the default is so plain,
so they took the High Contrast theme and made it more colorful.
Personally, I think their new theme looks hideous, with garish colors everywhere,
but hey,
<a HREF="http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-tribute-to-the-windows-31-hot-dog-stand-color-scheme/">
Hot Dog Stand is a thing</a>, so who am I to say.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the reason that Internet Explorer doesn't show Web page background
images is that you are using a high contrast theme,
albeit one
that maybe doesn't have as much contrast as
originally intended.
And since it is a high contrast theme,
applications will ask, "Is a high contrast theme active
(<code>SPI_<wbr>GET&shy;HIGH&shy;CONTRAST</code>)?",
and the operating system will say "Yup".
Or they'll ask
"Should I show overlapping content
(<code>SPI_<wbr>GET&shy;DISABLE&shy;OVERLAPPED&shy;CONTENT</code>)?"
and the operating system will say "Nope."
and applications will say,
"Oh, sorry.
I'll better remove background images,
textured backgrounds, watermarks, and any other content
that would interfere with the primary content.
I hope that helps."
</p>
<p>
In other words:
The reason the backgrounds are gone is that
you started with an accessibility theme,
so you're getting all the accessibility side effects.
If you want to create your Hot Dog Stand theme,
and you don't want the accessibility baggage,
then start with a theme that isn't an accessibility theme.

		<p>I, for one, had no idea that selecting a high contrast scheme had any effect other than the set of colors used.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there IS a workaround so that they don&#8217;t have to dump the garish theme and start from scratch: Modify the corresponding .theme file, which is really just a standard .ini with a fancy name. In the [VisualStyles] section is a HighContrast=1 entry, just remove that and it all goes back to normal&#8230; but if they happen to want SOME of the HighContrast benefits but not ALL of them, they&#8217;re just out of luck.</p>

		<p>Raymond, the reason customers tinker around with unintuitive settings like this is because Windows 8 and newer bizarrely limit your colour choices. I just want my theme to look exactly like the &#8220;Windows Classic Theme&#8221; which worked in Windows 7. Try to do that now &#8211; it&#8217;s impossible. Why?</p>

		<p>My bet is that they were trying to create a &#8220;Classic&#8221; theme in Windows 8 or Windows 10.  Selecting a high contrast theme seems to be the only way to activate the old rendering engine.  Some people really love that classic theme.  :)</p>

		<p>Correct; even the APIs silently fail if you haven&#8217;t set high contrast.</p>

		<p>Maybe a classic theme should be added to Windows?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
