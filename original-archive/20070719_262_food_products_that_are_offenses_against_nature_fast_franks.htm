<p>My colleague (who posts under the pseudonym <a href="http://cloudystarlight.spaces.live.com/"> Cloudy Starlight</a>) <a href="http://cloudystarlight.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E9F7F433894A3F89!146.entry?_c11_blogpart_blogpart=blogview&amp;_c=blogpart#permalink"> tipped me off</a> to some wonderful products which made me just stare at the screen agape, unable to express my, um, awe. I'll focus on one of the products today; the others will have to wait for another day.</p>
<p> First, let's suppose you've got a hankerin' for a hot dog. Your adventure might go like this: </p>
<p> "Gotta have a hot dog, gotta have a hot dog. Where's that hot dog? In the fridge. Right, in the fridge. Open the fridge, find the hot dog. Find the hot dog. Got it. Need a bun. Where's the bun? <b>Where's the bun!</b> <font size="+1"> <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/70/3354.html"> My kingdom for a bun</a>!</font> Oh, there's the bun, &laquo;pant pant&raquo; ah, my bun, my precious. Okay, get a plate, need a plate. No, that one's too big. No, that's not microwave-safe. Okay, got a small microwave-safe plate. Put bun with hot dog on plate. Put plate in microwave oven. Punch in thirty seconds. Thirty seconds. Go. Oh wait, close door. Okay, go. Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight. Isn't there anything faster than a microwave?! Three. Two. One. DING! Yes! I have a hot dog! Put hot dog in bun. Ow, hot hot hot. Yes! Dog is in the bun! Let the hot dog-lisciousy goodness commence!" </p>
<p> If that's your experience with cooking a hot dog in a microwave, may I first recommend psychological treatment. You really need help. </p>
<p> Second, <a href="http://www.kraftfoods.com/oscarmayer/main.aspx?s=product&amp;m=product/product_display&amp;Site=1&amp;Product=4470000541"> Oscar Mayer Fast Franks</a> has been created just for you. Instead of that entire adventure with the bun and the plate, the good people at Kraft have <i>already put the hot dog in a bun</i> and even provided the plate! Thus you've saved an entire <i>four seconds</i> of hot dog preparation time. Added up over a year of a daily hot dog obsession, that comes out to nearly twenty-five minutes of your life wasted putting hot dogs in buns and putting them on plates. You could watch an entire episode of <i>Futurama</i> with time left over to replay the best jokes! </p>
<p> Let's take a look at their <a href="http://www.kraft.com/newsroom/OMRanks.html"> press release</a>. I reprint it here in its entire awesomeness: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>READY, SET, HOT DOG!</b><br> New <i>Oscar Mayer Fast Franks</i> Speed into Summer  </p>
<p> MADISON, WI, May 31, 2006 &mdash;It's mouthwatering to imagine -- a tasty, hot and juicy <i>Oscar Mayer</i> hot dog wrapped inside a soft and warm bakery-fresh bun. And now imagine only having to wait thirty-five seconds for that first delicious bite.  </p>
<p> The great taste and convenience of hot dogs in a bun come together with <i>Oscar Mayer Fast Franks</i>. Each individually wrapped <i>Oscar Mayer Fast Frank</i> tastes great thanks to a specially designed microwavable paper tray that heats the bun just right -- so it's soft and warm right out of the microwave. Preparation is easy, and there's no cook top mess or boiling water! The hot dog is simply unwrapped, placed in the bun on a specially designed microwaveable tray and heated for a quick 35 seconds, making a delicious all-in-one hot after-school snack for kids, a fun dinner item or part of a quick and yummy <span style="background: yellow"> lunch for the whole family</span>. Whether it's in the kitchen or on the go, <i>Oscar Mayer Fast Franks</i> are a summertime favorite that can now be enjoyed any day or time of the year.  </p>
<p> <b> <span style="background: yellow"> Innovation in a Bun</span>: An Oscar Mayer Tradition</b> </p>
<p> For more than 120 years, <i>Oscar Mayer</i> continues to lead the industry in making hot dogs using only quality meat and no fillers. In a trusted brand families love, <i>Oscar Mayer</i> has created this innovative new product to satisfy America's love for hot dogs in a more convenient way. By leveraging <span style="background: yellow"> proprietary dough technology</span>, <i>Oscar Mayer Fast Franks</i> have made hot dogs easier to enjoy than ever before.  </p>
<p> <i>Oscar Mayer Fast Franks</i> will be available in most grocery and convenience stores' refrigerated sections nationwide beginning this summer. </p>

<p> That's right, they use <i>proprietary dough technology</i>. This ain't your grandfather's hot dog bun, no siree. We had researchers toiling away day and night perfecting their dough technology to bring you this perfect specimen of a hot dog bun. </p>
<p> And what's with that whole Julie Roberts thing at the end? <a href="http://www.wxix.com/Global/story.asp?S=4849292"> What does that have to do with hot dogs</a>? And "A" isn't a self-titled album. Her name isn't "A"; it's Julie Roberts! </p>
<p> But that's okay, because it's a quick and yummy lunch <i>for the whole family</i>. Note that that's a family of three people, since only three hot dogs come in a package. We're talking mommy, daddy, and the kid who throws a tantrum unless he gets a microwave hot dog in thirty seconds. </p>
<p> Wait a second, what did it say at the top? Thirty-<i>five</i> seconds? Not thirty seconds? My four-seconds savings gone down the tubes! Noooo! Don't take away my <i>Futurama</i>! </p>

		<p>There were a bunch of Burger King radio commercials to talk about their &quot;stacker burgers&quot;. The tongue-in-cheek commercials referenced proprietary meat-on-meat technology, a space-age bun to contain all the meat, and the audactious claims that it doesn&#8217;t take 47 men to lift.</p>
<p>I wonder who greenlighted &quot;proprietary dough technology.&quot; Maybe it was supposed to be a joke?</p>

		<p>It would be real innovation if the hot dog could heat itself &#8211; like Wolfgang Puck&#8217;s ill-fated self-heating coffee. &nbsp;(<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2004-12-19-self-heat_x.htm?csp=15" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2004-12-19-self-heat_x.htm?csp=15</a> , &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.bevnet.com/news/2006/04-28-2006-wolfgang_puck_self_heating_cans.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bevnet.com/news/2006/04-28-2006-wolfgang_puck_self_heating_cans.asp</a>)</p>
<p>Then one would have a better chance of enjoying it on the go!</p>

		<p>I believe Oreo cookies has their (annual?) contest for singing the jingle. At least the local radio keeps pumping ads for it..</p>
<p>I wonder if the proprietary part is selling the dog/bun combination. Given how darn near anything can be patented, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Kraft Foods has a patent on this..</p>
<p>I still like the sky-mall hot-dog bun and hot dog cooker toaster combo (search on &quot;Pop-up Hotdog Cooker&quot; if you haven&#8217;t seen it..).</p>

		<p>Oh, and according to Wikipedia, the album is called &quot;Julie Roberts&quot;, so they got the &quot;self-titled&quot; part right. They just got the name of the album wrong.</p>
<p>Yes, any copy editor should have picked up on it.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know how it is in the US, but in Euroland you do not attempt to heat a hotdog in a microwave.</p>
<p>The bread goes limp and soggy, and the hotdog tears or even explodes. &nbsp;Of course, this is freshly baked bread, without perservatives, and the dog is a &quot;vinerly&quot;.</p>
<p>I would purchase &#8216;Fast Franks&#8217; if given the chance &#8211; saves me 10 minutes: heat bread in oven, bring water to boil, cool down with a dash of beer &#8211; heat hotdog in water for 3-4 minutes.</p>

		<p>&quot;using only quality meat and no fillers&quot;</p>
<p>Hang on a moment. That link lists the ingredients as containing: MECHANICALLY SEPARATED TURKEY, MECHANICALLY SEPARATED CHICKEN, WATER and CORN SYRUP. Quality? No fillers? It&#8217;s also got a lot of salt (33% daily value) but hey, it&#8217;s less than 2%!</p>
<p>Skizz</p>
<p>OK, I admit it, I&#8217;m the one in the shop reading the labels.</p>

		<p>That &quot;Gotta have a hot dog, gotta have a hot dog&quot; (and the similar repetitions) made me think of the Doctor Dolittle movie (Eddie Murphy) and the psycothic dog &quot;Throw the ball, throw the ball&quot;. :-)</p>
<p>I wonder if that was what Raymond had in mind while writing it.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, this post displays a sad state of (parts of) humanity, as that text probably makes some people actually buy it. :-(</p>
<p>To connect to the blog&#8217;s usual content, it also reminds me of Windows. How? Each new version is &quot;More secure than ever!&quot; and &quot;Now with new flashy&#8230; thingies&quot;.</p>

		<p>At first I misread the singer&#8217;s name as &quot;Julia Roberts.&quot; &nbsp;I was wondering if maybe the actress decided to begin a singing career. &nbsp;And perhaps released an album of hot dog songs.</p>
<p>Not that it makes any more sense as Julie Roberts.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that &#8216;self-titled&#8217; just means that the album named itself. &nbsp;I suppose the album could name itself anything it wanted to (assuming no undue external influence that would degrade the &#8216;self-titled&#8217; concept), but maybe &#8216;A&#8217; is about the limit of its knowledge.</p>
<p>Or did they mean eponymous album?</p>

		<p>Well, according to Wikipedia (not an absolute authority, but other sources seem to agree): &quot;An eponym is the name of a person, whether real or fictitious, who has (or is thought to have) given rise to the name of a particular place, tribe, discovery, or other item. An eponymous person is the person referred to by the eponym. In contemporary English, the term eponymous is often used to mean self-titled. The word eponym is often used for the thing titled.&quot;</p>

		<p>The bakers and the frank-makers actually had several meetings about matching up the number of buns in a package of buns with the number of franks in a package of franks. Meetings! Travel expense reports! All of that! Fortunately it has mostly worked out.</p>

		<p>1.) The &quot;proprietary dough technology&quot; they&#8217;re talking about is just that &#8212; technology they invented for keeping a bun from becoming soggy or chewy after being microwaved. Breads don&#8217;t taste right in the microwave; these are supposed to. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s proprietary.</p>
<p>2.) This is old. Real, real old. When was the last time you went to a supermarket?</p>
<p>3.) Granted, it&#8217;s an incredibly lame product, but this is a pretty stupid thing to nitpick about &#8212; especially when some of your nitpicks aren&#8217;t even valid.</p>

		<p>You need special dough to keep the hot dog bun from become like concrete. Wet and gunky to start then setting to a stone-like consistency.</p>
<p>This is one case where primitive technology (aka cooking over a real fire) is preferable to high tech.</p>

		<p>I remember in elementary school a representative from the local power company came with a miniature mock up of electric poles to teach about electrical safety. &nbsp;The representative proceeded to cook some hot dogs by shorting out the power lines between the poles, with the warning that something similar could happen to us if we touched a downed power line.</p>

		<p>In the UK there is a company who sells similar products (microwavable burgers, hot dogs and the like) who launched an advertising campaign in universities. &nbsp;Their main line was it was best to eat their stuff late at night, cos you&#8217;d be too drunk to cook for yourself and you would either a) burn yourself, b) burn the house down.</p>
<p>Was quite an ingenious advertising campaign I thought :)</p>

		<p>Hey &#8211; I&#8217;ve actually had these things, and they&#8217;re pretty good (as far as hotdogs go).</p>
<p>And the bit about the buns (or dough) being proprietary &#8211; I&#8217;ll tell you what, you get a very different experience putting a regular old hotdog bun in the microwave for as long as it takes to heat the whole hotdog.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t use the &#8216;Fast Franks&#8217; then you better heat the dog and the bun separately.</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; it seems like I know far too much about hotdogs (don&#8217;t forget the onions and mustard!).</p>

		<p>Before the microwave, there were dedicated hot dog cookers that virtually disintermediated the application of power to the task. You stick the dogs between little prongs, close the lid, and press a button to *electrocute* them. It was faster than a microwave and hot dog brand agnostic, but for buns and plates you were on your own.</p>

		<p>It is unacceptable that the hot dogs takes 35 seconds to heat. The typical Microwave&#8217;s instant cook buttons only operates in 30 second intervals.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what you get when you have engineers creating a product without thinking about the end to end scenario.</p>

		<p>@Steven: Last month in Brazil a company started selling microwavable hamburgers. The TV ad says the burgers have a &quot;super microwave taste&quot;.</p>
<p>I do *not* want to try one of those. I strongly believe I won&#8217;t like the taste of plastic, steel, LCD and circuit boards of a microwave oven.</p>

		<p>Not to rain on the parade, but I think the comment of it being a 3 person family might be due to a misread:</p>
<p>[PART of a quick and yummy lunch for the whole family]</p>
<p>So a box of 3 is only part of the yummy lunch, meaning the whole lunch could be contained in perhaps 2 boxes?</p>

		<p>&quot;self titled&quot; means, obviously, that she called it &#8216;A&#8217;, ALL BY HERSELF. No-one helped her title the album, so, therefore, it was &quot;self titled.&quot;</p>
<p>It seems so clear to me. ;)</p>

<p>@ Brian:</p>
<p>I actually like the nitpickers for 2 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Nitpickers&#8217; Corner is always amusing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No matter what happens in my life, no matter how bad things get, it reassures me that I am actually quite balanced and rational compared to some people&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Steven:</p>
<p>They were riffing off some Fire Brigade ads from about five years ago. Yes, our emergency services explicitly said to drunk people &quot;Get a kebab, don&#8217;t be one.&quot; The instant-burger manufacturers are hawking a similar idea, but nowhere near as nice as a good kebab.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
