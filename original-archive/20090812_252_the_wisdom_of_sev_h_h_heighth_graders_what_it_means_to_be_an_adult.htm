<p>Since I'm obviously a glutton for punishment, I also helped read eighth grade essays on the same topic: Describe the qualities you consider to be those which make someone an adult. As always, remember that these are just the funny sentences/excerpts.</p>
<p> <b>Let me tell you about my parents</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>My dad looks older for one reason because he has facial hair. </li>
<li>[My father] doesn't look young and muscular like most teens do. </li>
<li>Some people are just plain dumb, but not my dad. </li>
<li>My dad works at his extremely boring Job every day. </li>
<li>If you slack on your work and     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="lag">lagger</span>     behind     you won't have a good image when people think of you.     Fortunately, my dad has covered this quality.     <i>Your dad is a slacker?</i> </li>
<li>He is a photographer so he has to work with a lot of people.     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="A lot">Alot</span>     of those people are ignorant and stuffy politicians. </li>
<li>My dad goes down to Seattle practically every day     and does stuff I'm not totally sure about but he's a lawyer. </li>
<li>My dad is an adult because [he] makes a budget     so he can pay the bills on time,     so we can keep our house and not get our car     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="towed">toed</span>.     <i>It's called     <a href="http://www.familycar.com/Alignment.htm#Toe">     wheel alignment</a>, and toeing is a good thing.</i> </li>
<li>My dad is an adult partly because he     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="made">mad</span>     it through     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="high school">highschool</span>     and     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="college">collage</span>.     <i>I wonder whether he majored in anger management.</i> </li>
<li>My Dad... !! yayz! </li>
<li>Three children and a wife can be a real hassle,     some people can't even handle one. </li>
<li>[Dad] recently had this mid life crisis I believe,     he went kind of crazy and bought all this equipment for making music.     He made his songs, and then kinda transitioned back to normal. </li>
<li>He has engendered a family. </li>
<li>In all     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="to">te</span>     be considered an adult you have to be at or over 18.     And I assure you my mom is well over 18. </li>
<li>College also gave her [my mother] a social experience.     This is important because it gave her a dose of     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="adulthood">adultery</span>.     <i>Does your father know this?</i> </li>
<li>My mom is always my home skillet biscuit.     <i>Fo' shizzle.</i> </li>
<li>This means that my mom can drive and drink     both things together only an adult can do.     <i>I take it your mom isn't     a member of <a href="http://www.madd.org/home/">MADD</a>.</i> </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Entering a no fun zone</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Being immature is like acting like a monkey     or making fart noises with your mouth. </li>
<li>[Adults should be] even keel     (that means they don't go completely berserk if they don't get dessert) </li>
<li>You can't     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="slack off">     slackoff</span>     like you did in middle school. </li>
<li>No grownup is lazy. </li>
<li>No more being babied by mommy. </li>
<li>Movies: OK.<br>     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="T.P.-ing">     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_papering">     Teaping</a></span>: Not OK. </li>
<li>When adults do work like working in the yard,     they can go for hours on end!! Meanwhile we're in school going insane! </li>
<li>Hitting isn't going to solve anything     because it's just going to get you     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="sued">sewed</span>     and thrown into the big house.     <i>As ye sew so shall ye rip.</i> </li>
<li>Jobs can be stressful, boring, and horrible     especially if you don't like your job. </li>
<li>Her job brings in a     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="luxuriant">luxurient</span>     amount of money. </li>
<li>People who still live with their parents     when they're 30 years old are not really adults. </li>
<li>Go out get a job get a house and start a family.     Don't wait or your gonna end up living with your parents! </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>It's harder than I thought</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Emotions make yourself weak and in life only the strong remain. </li>
<li>I consider one person to be an adult.     <i>Wow, pretty exclusive club.</i> </li>
<li>To be a great adult you should try to resemble Jerry Seinfeld.     <i>Is that the one person?</i> </li>
<li>When I think of the word adult, I think of people like my Dad,     my Mom, my teachers, and random parents I know.     <i>Like, a lottery?</i> </li>
<li>A adult should have a decent car like     a     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="shiny">shiney</span>     Corvette with     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="shiny">shiney</span>     wheels. </li>
<li>Being grown up is very rare and you might only see it     a few times in your life. [...]     Being [an adult] requires "the look."     When you look into an adult's eyes and see wariness, regret,     stern impassiveness, but most of all, intelligence. </li>
<li>Believe in your yes and the Believing will make it happen,     make you a good leader.     <i>Okay, you lost me at the "Believe in your yes" part.</i> </li>
<li>You need to be social to have friends and have fun as an adult.     Instead of "cowering" in a dark corner of your high school reunion. </li>
<li>You can     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="drive">dive</span>     to and from work. </li>
<li>You have to pay the     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="mortgage">morgue</span>. </li>
<li>... independent, responsible, and always goes beyond what     he can do.     <i>He takes on more than he can handle?</i> </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Tautology corner</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>An easy way to tell if someone's an adult is to see how mature they are. </li>
<li>When you are a child, you have just about no maturity. </li>
<li>There are numerous reasons why I believe     the starting of college is the point you enter college. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Assorted commentary</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, you have to be patient as an adult,     because you might have kids you might not,     but they are always everywhere. </li>
<li>Parents are adults, clowns are adults,     the ice cream man is an adult, most teachers are adults,     and even teachers are adults....     Adults seem to be completely ubiquitous.     <i>About as ubiquitous as children, apparently.</i> </li>
<li>I think that every adult should have a job that gives     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="decent">descent</span>     money.     <i>How about moral decay money? Can I get that, too?</i> </li>
<li>When teenagers think "adult"     most picture a grown up human being that can vote and     drink alcohol until they puke.     <i>I'm having second thoughts on that moral decay money.</i> </li>
<li>Most adults fly off the handle at kids who are obnoxious or     at their stupid boss at their stupid work.     <i>Having issues, are we?</i> </li>
<li>It would be hard to live in a world with immature adults.     <i>Yet somehow we manage.</i> </li>
<li>... kids can get away with mistakes,     because they're seen as little dogs who don't know any better. </li>
<li>I'd like to live a low-stress life     for a few more years before society demands my presence.     <i>Enjoy your doghood for a little while longer.</i> </li>
<li>If I am angry at someone or something,     she is always by my side ready to fight.     <i>Is this an adult or an anime character?</i> </li>
<li>Without responsibilities, adults would be just like kids but much taller. </li>
<li>Some people have all the experience in the world,     but they have never     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="analyzed">analized</span>     it.     <i>Anal-ization sounds painful.</i> </li>
<li>Do you want to know what an adult is?     Well, I hope so, 'Cause you're about to find out! </li>
<li>Now we're getting off topic so let's wrap this up. </li>
<li>There are     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="probably">probly</span>     more things to being an adult     but what do I know I just trying to get     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="past">passed</span>     8th grade. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Misspelling corner.</b> I've included more context; that may make the game a bit easier. </p>
<ul>
<li>She [Mom] also runs a house with no     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="husband">hunban</span>     on the weekdays. </li>
<li>The thing I don't like is the     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="chores">chorse</span>     that she makes me do. </li>

<li>... a great person that     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="reflects">reflex</span>     what a real adult should be like. </li>

<li><span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Those">Thoughs</span>     people have the maturity of an eighth grader. </li>

		<p>I guess I&#8217;m only sort of an adult (I have my own apartment, but still spend a lot of time with my parents and have a dedicated room there, not to mention rely a lot on their help). Then again maybe the criteria is different when you&#8217;re 29?</p>

		<p>To be very honest, though, the living by themselves when in 30&#8217;s may only apply in western societies or wealthy countries. In many Asian countries for example, many singles (and sometimes even married couples!) still live with their parents. The reasons are not outside imaginations:</p>
<ol>
<li>In some Eastern cultures, living in family settings is a better virtue than living by themselves.</li>
<li>
<p>Cost-saving. Take Hong Kong, my birth-place, as an example. A 300-feet unit can cost about HK$2mil (round that to about US$250K), while a friend of mine being a teacher (considered good paid in HK) had an income equivalent to US$30K/yr. Rentals are pretty expensive too. It is far cheaper to live with your parents. (By the same argument, buying a car in HK, even when translated to US currency, still costs 3-4 times more than the exact same model in USA.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even when living with parents, many young people (singles or couples) bear the financial responsibilities, because they are better paid (or their parents have retired). I&#8217;ve even seen 3-generation families living under the same unit way smaller than 1000 sq. fts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, while the &quot;Being an adult is being self-supportive&quot; argument may be true in USA, I consider this as culture-specific, as in Eastern cultures, being an adult takes further as &quot;taking responsibilities of supporting your family members&quot;, from financial suitations to daily lives, because quite some singles and couples choose to live with their parents as their elderly parents need physical help.</p>

		<p>This post was a great way to start a day. Thanks!</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Is this an adult or an anime character?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>By the way, would you mind posting on this topic? I.e. do you watch any, your impressions etc. I believe quite a few readers here would be interested.</p>

<p>I dunno about that. Lots of people in Taiwan live with or near their parents, but they do seem to me to be (hunts for a tactful way to put it) &#8230; younger emotionally &#8230; than people of the same age/background would be if they&#8217;d spent more time in the US or Europe. I.e. their parents basically tell them what to do. I still think that being self supportive is part of being an adult. Not to say that the Western model where people leave home earlier and never return is better, just that it enforces self sufficiency and independence better. Of course in terms of caring for elderly relatives it is worse.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230; a great person that reflex what a real adult should be like&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is a misspelling. I think they&#8217;re just a Duran Duran fan &#8230; :-)</p>

		<p>&quot;The truth of it all is your house is the central gravitational force, pulling bits of your life together.&quot;</p>
<p>As opposed to the non-central gravitational force, that pulls everything apart. So, if you don&#8217;t have central gravity, only use one window gravitational unit at a time.</p>

		<p>An an adult I would say that: being an adult is having conservative political views</p>
<p>As an old (turn of the 20th century) Jewish saying goes: If you weren&#8217;t a communist before you were 20 you have no heart. But if you are a communist after you&#8217;re 20 you have no brains.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
