<p>I know someone who has a brother who works in Taipei, Taiwan. He travels to Japan often on business, and one day he needed to fly to Tokyo on short notice. He instructed his assistant to book the next flight from Taipei to Tokyo.</p>
<p> <a href="http://evakitty.evaair.com/">This is what he got</a>. (Warning: Contains strange music.) </p>
<p> That's right. His assistant booked him on <a href="http://www.evaair.com/html/b2c/english/eva/News/2005/new20050521.htm"> Hello Kitty Air</a>, initially a daily flight from Taipei to Fukuoka, but soon extended to <a href="http://www.evaair.com/html/b2c/english/eva/News/2005/News_110401.htm"> a second run to Tokyo</a>. <a href="http://rojaks.blogspot.com/2006/09/hello-kitty-craze-hello-kitty-airline.html"> Everything on this plane is Hello Kitty</a>. The paint scheme, the flight attendants, the boarding passes, the luggage tags, the chopsticks, the sugar packets, the in-flight meals, even the <a href="http://static.flickr.com/50/136667098_1b9940e98e_m.jpg"> barf bags</a>. I'm told that most people who take this flight are women who are way too into this Hello Kitty thing. </p>
<p> Anyway, he learned his lesson. Now when he has an urgent meeting in Tokyo, he tells his assistant, "Book me the next flight to Tokyo, but <i>not</i> the Hello Kitty one." </p>
<p> This story made me wonder what a "guy version" of the Hello Kitty plane would be. When I brought it up with my colleagues, we quickly agreed that it would be a <i>Star Wars</i>-themed airplane. But what would be the in-flight movie? (And <a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/2008/04/60761/"> which Leia</a> will the female flight attendants be dressed as?) </p>
<p> <b>Sidebar</b>: There's also a <a href="http://www.hellokittyonline.com/us/">Hello Kitty MMORPG</a>. (Warning: Contains annoyingly cute music.) </p>

		<p>I guess nowadays it&#8217;s all about niche market. There is a Germany Airline opened a nude flight route to a nude resort beach located on the coast. You can be naked during the flight. This might be close to guy&#8217;s version of the Kitty?</p>

		<p>I took that flight once from Tokyo to Taipei, it was an interesting experience. &nbsp;To make matters worse I had just flown from the east coast of the US to Tokyo so I was pretty groggy. &nbsp; &nbsp;Even the food is Hello Kitty themed, I particularly remember a little Hello Kitty shaped snack cake.</p>
<p>On the plus side, EVA Air is pretty nice and the in-flight entertainment system is one of the best ones I&#8217;ve seen.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
