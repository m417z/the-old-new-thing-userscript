<p>Well, at least I only passed out once.</p>
<p> To recap, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2005/09/20/471844.aspx"> The E's goaded me into joining them</a> on a ride up <a href="http://bicycleclimbs.com/climbData/Climb_6.htm"> Zoo Hill</a>. I'm really not a climber. I'm taxed by <a href="http://virtualearth.msn.com/default.aspx?cp=47.655515%7C-122.138449&amp;style=h&amp;lvl=17&amp;v=1"> the hill on the southbound 520 Trail leading to NE 51st St</a>., so much so that I commute to work along a different route (taking 156th Ave.&nbsp;NE instead) just so I can avoid it. But I accepted their challenge anyway. </p>
<p> I didn't literally pass out, but I did run out of steam at <a href="http://virtualearth.msn.com/default.aspx?cp=47.54841%7C-122.109097&amp;style=h&amp;lvl=18&amp;v=1"> 173rd Ave SE</a> and had to stop for a nap. Well, okay not really a nap, just a sit-down break, but I really could've used a nap right then. Maybe if I had remembered to bring an inflatable pillow. </p>
<p> And then I missed <a href="http://virtualearth.msn.com/default.aspx?cp=47.54833%7C-122.112331&amp;style=h&amp;lvl=19&amp;v=1"> the turn onto SE Cougar Mountain Dr</a>. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2005/09/24/473683.aspx"> The instructions</a> said to turn left at the stop sign, but I didn't realize that it was a stop sign for <strong>another road</strong> that I was to be on the lookout for. It wasn't until I took the turn onto 168th Pl NE that I realized I missed it, at which point I turned around and found the early finishers who had descended from the top, gathered at the stop sign. (I'm guessing that it was while I was on this unexpected detour that <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/fatcyclist/blog/cns!1pUmGvi9idWgOodsIbhHUOQA!1435.entry"> the Fat Cyclist went past on his way down searching for me</a>. Sorry. Don't worry about the cake; I wasn't going to have any anyway.) </p>
<p> Aside: There seems to be some sort of psychology that says that if you've exercised a lot, then you've "earned" some sort of bad behavior. Fortunately, my brain doesn't fall for that trick. After a hard ride, I don't say, "Whoo, let's have some cake!" I just say, "Whoo, that was a hard ride." If I even think about what I've "earned", my attitude is to "bank it for the future"; i.e., maybe next week I can eat something decadent. Eventually, next week comes, and I say, "Eh, I don't really need cake that bad. I should stick to my diet." Result: No cake pig-out. Weight under control. </p>
<p> Here's a tip to cyclists: Remember which lever shifts to a higher gear and which shifts to a lower one. As I was being passed by Simeon, I felt the need to downshift, but in my delirium, I upshifted. My legs told me, "Nope, gear still too high, try some more," and my hand once again reached for the upshift lever. Only after the third iteration of this communications failure did my brain step in and say, "No no, you're doing this all wrong," and convince my hand to push the <strong>other</strong> lever. But by then it was too late; my legs were saying, "You moron! Look what you did to me!" </p>
<p> It was shortly after this mental lapse that I had to stop for a nap. </p>
<p> (Oh, and I over-estimated how long it would take me to get to the starting point from my house. It was only an hour's ride. Afterwards, I joined a colleague in a descent down the other side of the hill and cycled into the more densely-populated parts of Issaquah, eventually converging later that evening on a Battlestar Galactica-watching party we had been invited to.) </p>

		<p>I not only subscribe to the earned bad behavior theory, I also seem to think it&#8217;s OK to go into debt. Ie, &quot;I&#8217;ll eat an entire cake right now, with the understanding that I will exercise like a maniac for the next four days.&quot;</p>
<p>At this point, I need to excersise like a maniac until 2019.</p>

		<p>That hill (51st street) is IMPOSSIBLE.  I&#8217;m always put to shame when seeing parents drag their children along in kid-trailers behind them.  Much approve of the BSG-watching.</p>

		<p>Ray,</p>
<p>Sorry that the directions weren&#8217;t better, and I hope you survived it well (nobody enjoys the Zoo).</p>
<p>Note to readers. 51st is easy compared to the zoo.</p>

		<p>Shifting in the wrong direction is a hazard of owning more than one bicycle, with different types of derailleurs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s especially hazardous when one of those bicycles is a Tandem, your stoker is really &quot;looking for a gear&quot;, and you blow the shift.</p>
<p>Can you spell &quot;walk the rest of the way. . .  we&#8217;ll never get started on this incline&quot;?</p>
<p>sigh</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
