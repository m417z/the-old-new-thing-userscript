		<p>yeah, &nbsp;I do the same thing all the time, with acronyms that are getting way overloaded. &nbsp;In conversation with someone I don&#8217;t know well I have asked to clarify acronyms to double check the one that I am hearing is the one I should be hearing.</p>

		<p>Now, the only question left open is: Where are CEOs able to look for some real mspp-pve action? (Just in the case, they dont want to participate in pvp? :-D )</p>

		<p>PVP &#8211; Your main opponent is the programmer who wrote this dreck you have to maintain.</p>
<p>PVE &#8211; It&#8217;s you against the labyrinthine development environment.</p>
<p>Makes perfect sense to me, this could catch on.</p>

		<p>While not as common as PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride, used in pipes for irrigation, etc.), PVP = polyvinylpyrolidone which is used in medical and surgical applications. &nbsp;Unless you mean Percutaneous vertebroplasty or peripheral venous pressure&#8230;</p>

		<p>I saw it as Microsoft Powerpoint Player Versus Player. What, they somehow made a multiplayer game in powerpoint?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like at my place of work, we have &quot;TK&quot;. First thought: Team Kill. Actually means, Team Knowledge.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get flamed for this, but I don&#8217;t see where else to ask, as the Suggestion Box appears to be closed:</p>
<p>I went to install a new font the other night&#8230;why does the dialog for the font installer still look like it came out of Win 3.x, even under XP? &nbsp;Just curious. &nbsp;Did this get overlooked or forgotten at some point? &nbsp;:-)</p>

		<p>The suggestion box is closed for a reason, which is clearly explained on the suggestion box page. &nbsp;I suggest you try using a search engine.</p>

		<p>Dean, thanks for pointing that out&#8230;I didn&#8217;t see it. &nbsp;Greg, thanks for the understanding. &nbsp;Having been on the Internet for some thirteen years now&#8230;I had no idea that I could use a search engine. &nbsp;My bad.</p>

		<p>Kevin, let me be more explicit then:</p>
<p>use a search engine to search for &quot;font dialog&quot; site:blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing</p>
<p>and you might find this entry from 4 years ago:</p>
<p>Yes, the Add Fonts dialog was written for 16-bit Windows. But it turns out that almost nobody installs fonts that way any more. Which Longhorn feature would you cut to make room to improve the Add Fonts dialog?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
