<p>During the Windows&nbsp;95 project, we had a super-sized whiteboard in the hallway outside the build lab in order to keep track of the most critical bugs that were blocking the release of the build. I remember one day I was walking past the board, and two of my colleagues were particularly interested in one of the bugs. Its current status had recently been updated to something like "Problem understood, fix coming, ETA 2pm." But they weren't as interested in the bug itself as in the identity of the person who made the update.</p>
<p> Janice asked Rachel, "Do you know who wrote that?" </p>
<p> "No, but it's clearly a woman's handwriting." </p>
<p> "Obviously, but who could it have been? I would have guessed Laura, but I know her writing and that's not it." </p>
<p> "Ahem," I interjected. "I wrote that." </p>
<p> An awkward silence. </p>
<p> "Oh, it's very nice handwriting, really." </p>
<p> "Yes, very graceful." </p>
<p> Looking back at my penmanship through the years, I think that era was my peak. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/03/WindowsConfidential/"> It has been declining steadily ever since</a>. Sometimes I stop to try to recover some of its former glory, but at best it's just holding its ground. </p>

		<p>I&#8217;ll never understand how people can write neatly. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t have the worlds worst chicken scratch, but it&#8217;s closer to it than to caligraphy.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things I&#8217;ve noticed about my own signature, is that it&#8217;s never anything close to the same twice. &nbsp;I wonder if that makes me more or less secure against forgery?</p>

		<p>When I was in the Army, one of my fellow lieutenants had the most beautiful handwriting I&#8217;d ever seen&#8230;it looked like the hand of Thomas Jefferson or one of my ex-girlfriends.</p>
<p>Turns out he was schooled by Jesuits and that beautiful handwriting had been beaten into him by the Sisters who ran his school.</p>
<p>He was an excellent officer and a good friend. &nbsp;May God rest his soul.</p>

		<p>Raymond&#8217;s writing has lots of swoopy descenders. &nbsp;Sometimes they are used to cross t&#8217;s in lower lines, which is just cool. &nbsp;Words like &quot;to&quot; and &quot;the&quot; are very stylized, almost into their own characters.</p>

		<p>Did you learn to write Chinese characters at an early age? Most of my Chinese friends have a distinctive style of English penmanship, which I think comes out of learning to write Hanzi. I guess it could be considered a little effeminate-looking. (although I wish I could write as well)</p>

		<p>so a by who writes like a &#8216;girl&#8217; has issues? what is it to &#8216;write like a girl&#8217;? Is it &#8216;loopy&#8217; bits. Then does that mean I write like a boy because I &#8216;lack loops&#8217; does that mean I&#8217;ve got more issues than a broken space-bar, melted power cable and now flashing internal flat display on my laptop? &nbsp;</p>

		<p>If you put a heart in place of a dot then you&#8217;re writing like a girl&#8230; Or use pink pen &lt;shudder&gt; </p>

		<p>My (Script) handwriting has been deteriorating since, I think, 1976, when, in 8th grade, I started printing some things. &nbsp;(Actually, I had regular complaints from teachers about my penmanship before that &#8212; which I ignored on the basis that while my writing may not have looked pretty, every letter looked distinct, unlike the Palmer method, where every letter looked alike.)</p>
<p>Anyway, throughout High School I printed more &amp; more of my work. &nbsp;By the time I reached college, and I first got a checking account, the only thing I still wrote in script was the amount-as-words on the check. &nbsp;About a year or two later, I realized I was better off printing that as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, for the past 20 years, the only think I&#8217;ve written in script is my signature. &nbsp;However, even that has deteriorated to the point where it&#8217;s just &quot;J&#8212;&#8211; M. C&#8212;-n</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
