<p>Back in Windows&nbsp;95, people would notice that their hard  drive light would blink every few seconds.  What's that all about?</p>
<p>  Actually, it wasn't the hard drive light after all.  </p>
<p>  Windows&nbsp;95 was polling your CD-ROM drive to see whether  you had inserted a new CD.  Some computers wired up the  "hard drive light" not to the hard drive but rather to the  SCSI and/or IDE bus.  So the light didn't indicate hard drive  activity necessarily.  It turned on for any bus activity.  </p>
<p>  Fortunately, motherboard manufacturers discovered their mistake  and nowadays you don't find any of them that miswire the hard  drive access light.  </p>
<p>  Or do you?    I keep my computer under my desk so I never see the hard drive  light anyway.  I'm just surmising that in the past seven years,  motherboard manufacturers have gotten their act together.  </p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>my acer travelmate (running xp pro) has its harddrive light on almost all of the time when i&#8217;m <em>not</em> working with the machine. [i can see the light, because obviously the laptop is not located under my desk. :) ]</p>
<p>i just need to stop typing and wait for a few seconds and it&#8217;ll turn on. soon as i do something (like opening taskman to find out what process is doing that) the light stops. obviously, taskmanager never shows any activity &#8230; :) </p>
<p>my other acer shows the same behaviour&#8230; </p>
<p>maybe this is the index service, but thats just a guess &#8230; i never really took the time to find out what is causing this.</p>
<p>anyhow: <em>something</em> in xp is making the hd lamp blink, at least on two acer laptops :)</p>

		<p>On XP and 2000 (or even the rest of the NT line), it&#8217;s two things:</p>
<p>1. It could be IndexServer indexing your drive&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>2. It&#8217;s the VMM walking through your pagefile taking dead pages and writing zeroes to them for security and perf. reasons.</p>

		<p>I hated that feature.  I had a very primitive CDROM drive (I think it was a 1/2 speed.  No kidding.), and not only did the case light go on, but the CD light would go on, much as it would if I had left a disc in there.</p>
<p>But most hard drives of that era had two pins so you could attach the hard drive light directly to the drive, which I did.  Worked great until I got a second hard drive, and had to use the turbo light.  The third drive I put games on, so I didn&#8217;t care.</p>

		<p>On any NT-based system, it could also be the working-set trimmer writing dirty pages out to the hard disk, either to the swap file or to the mapped file if it&#8217;s a memory-mapped file (read-only and non-written pages are simply discarded).</p>
<p>XP also performs some idle-time disk optimisation using the Prefetch information, IIRC.</p>
<p>As far as I&#8217;m aware, the &#8216;disk&#8217; light has always been connected to the disk controller in most machines. Few hard disks I&#8217;m aware of offer a separate HDD LED connector. We have some IDE removable-drive caddies at work which do show the activity on the actual disk, but that&#8217;s rare.</p>

<p>Really?  I&#8217;m pretty sure all of mine do.  It&#8217;s never labelled, but often there are two pins on the front end of the drive.</p>
<p>But it might depend on who you buy drives from.  It&#8217;s also possible they&#8217;ve dropped it in recent years; the last HD I bought was just before ATA/100.</p>

		<p>asdf: go out to <a target="_new" href="http://www.sysinternals.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sysinternals.com/</a> and grab FileMon.  Windows is querying for the uninstaller, looking at access times, and basically just scanning the entire drive.  (not really, but it sure looks that way).</p>

		<p>RE: Disc Activity:</p>
<p>On XP you could also have System Restore making a backup of your configuration.</p>
<p>Or if your organisation runs SMS or some other auditing tool it might be scanning your system for junk (always fun when you&#8217;re running on batteries, you&#8217;re down to the last few minutes, and the SMS Agent decides to run an inventory of your system&#8230;NOT!)</p>

		<p>Why are users worried about harddrive activity, or RAM useage. The more RAM you use and the more activity you get simply means that you use your equipment. Of course I&#8217;d like my laptops harddrive to spin down from time to time to save the batteries but on my stationary I couldn&#8217;t care less.</p>

		<p>My problem with W2K and harddisk activity is not during operation but during the boot phase. I have one machine with four IDE harddrives. When W2K boots on that machine it will spend not seconds but minutes maltreating the harddrives. I have no idea what it does but it sounds real nasty. Sounds more like a IDE drive stress test than normal disk operation. And it prolongs the boot process beyond acceptable levels. So far I wasn&#8217;t able to figure out what causes this.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
