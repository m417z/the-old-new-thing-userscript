<p>One of the things that may strike you if you visit Microsoft's Redmond North campus is that there's a <a href="http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=ry7ry34tnxhx&amp;style=o&amp;lvl=2&amp;tilt=-90&amp;dir=0&amp;alt=-1000&amp;scene=3701438&amp;encType=1&amp;mkt=en-us"> large, dry fountain outside the cafeteria</a>. Why isn't the fountain running?</p>
<p> <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/256124_msftland18ww.html"> The Redmond North campus was purchased from Safeco</a>, and with the purchase, Microsoft obtained title to a fountain whose design had two fatal flaws: </p>
<ol>
<li>It had chronic and serious problems with water leakage. </li>
<li>It was built atop a parking garage. </li>
</ol>
<p> Having large quantities of water dripping into a parking garage is not a good situation, and the Facilities people shut off the water and drained the fountain to prevent any further water damage. Further investigation revealed that the problem was quite serious and was not a simple fix. In fact, things were so bad that repairing the fountain was ruled out as an option. To bring a fountain back to the area, the old fountain would have to be removed, the existing garage shored up to support the weight of a large fountain as well as making the joints waterproof, and then a new fountain designed and installed, an undertaking which is, shall we say, "not cheap." </p>
<p> Given that the Redmond North campus has drainage problems during the rainy season&sup1; as it is, you definitely don't want to compound the problem with a leaky fountain. </p>
<p> Consensus has yet to be reached on the unofficial nickname for the dry fountain. Some people call it <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=98052&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=47.651681,-122.134402&amp;spn=0.000349,0.000595&amp;t=h&amp;z=21&amp;om=0"> <i>The Moonscape</i></a>; others call it <i>The World's Largest Zen Rock Garden</i>. But so far, the leader in the naming competition appears to be simply <i>The Broken Fountain</i>. </p>
<p> Whatever its name, the dry fountain remains, a desolate tribute to bad civil engineering. </p>
<p> <b>Pre-emptive snarky comment</b>: Microsoft itself is a giant tribute to bad engineering. </p>
<p> &sup1;Standard Seattle joke:<br> Q: "When is the Seattle rainy season?"<br> A: "It runs from January 1 to December 31." </p>

		<p>Facilities should put the fountain&#8217;s blueprints on display in front of it, perhaps with their engineering report explaining all the flaws, next to it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the Open Source way.</p>

		<p>If it rains so much and the fountain leaks so badly, one wonders at the faulty logic in not removing the thing and tossing in some employee friendly sod, or in fact, a real zen rock garden.</p>

		<p>The map link you gave and the article in the Seattle Post-Intelligence say the lot is in two different places.</p>
<p>Locating the lot shown in the Seattle PI article gives the following location: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;ll=47.652741,-122.134758&amp;spn=0.001165,0.002701&amp;z=18" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;ll=47.652741,-122.134758&#038;spn=0.001165,0.002701&#038;z=18</a></p>
<p>Is it that rocky thing in the cluster of trees on the map I&#8217;m looking at, or the fountain that appears to be working on the map in your post?</p>

		<p>Oh, so fountains take water, here in Melbourne, Australia we don&#8217;t have enough water to be able to operate the fountains, so we have a city with a multitude of ornate non-operational statues.</p>
<p>Although I must say it&#8217;s amazing what can be done to make a fountain look like it was just a funky sculpture all along.</p>

		<p>&quot;Brokeback Fountain&quot; anyone? Hmmm? Hmmm? What, too obvious?</p>
<p>For some reason all maps.live.com addresses given don&#8217;t work here (tried 4 different browsers including IE) :( Guess that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re forcibly forwarded to maps.live.DE here?</p>

		<p>My preemptive snarky comment would have been something like, &quot;with all the cash MSFT and Gates has, such an undertaking should be a mere pittance.&quot; &nbsp;Think of how many job it would create. &nbsp;Plus think of all the money Gates isn&#8217;t spending not letting his kids have Apple products (iPod, iPhone, etc)</p>

<p>&quot;How does Raymond decide what to post on any particular day?&quot;</p>
<p>Discussion about the queue.</p>
<p>&quot;The Suggestion Box is for suggestions, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called a Suggestion Box&quot;</p>
<p>Reenabled adding items to the queue.</p>
<p>&quot;Do QueryProcessCycleTime and QueryThreadCycleTime include cycles spent in kernel mode?&quot;</p>
<p>The shortest entry in my recollection.</p>
<p>and now:</p>
<p>&quot;Why is there a dry fountain in the Redmond North campus?&quot;</p>
<p>An entry about a resource being empty&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sensing a theme here.</p>

		<p>I was hoping for a backwards-compatibility story. &nbsp;This is, after all, The Old New Thing. Like maybe there was someone who always parked in a leaky spot in that garage so that they could get a free car wash. &nbsp;And then they complained when their free car wash stopped. &nbsp;And that&#8217;s why Raymond had to rig up a garden sprinkler at this one parking spot.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#8217;s a good story the way that it is and all. &nbsp;I&#8217;m just saying it could have been more thematic. &nbsp;And it&#8217;s not too late to sneak in there with a garden sprinkler!!1!</p>

		<p>Marcel: +1 on &#8220;Brokeback Fountain&#8221;, I had the very same idea!</p>
<p>About the maps.live.com links: I noticed the same thing in Australia (substitute &#8220;.au&#8221; TLD, of course). I found out about a workaround, which is to add &#8220;&amp;mkt=en-us&#8221; to the URL. Just tested it and it worked :-D</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Thanks for the &amp;mkt=en-us tip. I&#8217;ve updated the link in the article. (And &#8220;Brokeback Fountain&#8221; is such a horrible pun&#8230;) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I think we should have a contest to come up with a good and reasonable idea for something to do with the dead fountain.</p>
<p>Like&#8230; replace it with a bubble-blowing machine. &nbsp;Or set up some kind of &quot;virtual fountain&quot; with a projector. &nbsp;Or heck, clear out the rocks and let me park my car there!</p>

		<p>In the spirit of useless information, I&#8217;ll add that it&#8217;s possible to get a leaking parking garage even without building a fountain &#8211; sometimes a courtyard is enough.</p>
<p>Reference buildings 40 &amp; 41.</p>

		<p>Seattle actually has a fairly-well defined rainy season, roughly September to early June. &nbsp;July and August are quite dry in Seattle.</p>
<p>Summer interns go back and report that Seattle is just like Southern California, but cooler.</p>

		<p>Microsoft has a lot of clever people aboard.</p>
<p>Do something clever with the fountain which does not require water. I&#8217;m quite sure that someone can come up with something really nice, even using an R&amp;D project to play around with it.</p>
<p>Make an interactive surface with it.</p>
<p>Or something which displays graphics based on the number of people at work against the number of cars in the carpark. Or just a really nice zen rock garden.</p>
<p>Whatever the solution, use in house talent. Giving the employees some input and feeling of this being their environment can only be good for morale. Figuring out something fun also, as well as maybe, just maybe something marketable comes out of the whole thing.</p>

		<p>Seattle is not rainy &#8211; it&#8217;s a big myth put about either by Seattle residents wanting to put visitors off, or Texans who think a drop of water is a monsoon.</p>
<p>The weather around Redmond is close to perfect, a summer that is hot and dry enough and a winter that snows.</p>
<p>(two years in Seattle and I miss the weather now I&#8217;m back in dear onld Blighty).</p>

		<p>&gt; an undertaking which is, shall we say, &#8220;not cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet they can afford to be wasteful with other people&#8217;s resources (electricity, HDD space)? (prefetch; .NET&#8230; nearly everything)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
