<p>If you pay close attention, you'll notice that most user interface actions tend to occur on the release, not on the press. When you click on a button, the action occurs when the mouse button is released. When you press the Windows key, the Start menu pops up when you release it. When you tap the Alt key, the menu becomes active when you release it. (There are exceptions to this general principle, of course, typing being the most notable one.) Why do most actions wait for the release?</p>
<p> For one thing, waiting for the completion of a mouse action means that you create the opportunity for the user to cancel it. For example, if you click the mouse while it is over a button (a radio button, push button, or check box), then drag the mouse off the control, the click is cancelled. </p>
<p> But a more important reason for waiting for the press is to ensure that the press won't get confused with the action itself. For example, suppose you are in mode where objects disappear when the user clicks on them. For example, it might be a customization dialog, with two columns, one showing available objects and another showing objects in use. Clicking on an available object moves it to the list of in-use objects and vice versa. Now, suppose you acted on the click rather than the release. When the mouse button goes down while the mouse is over on an item, you remove it from the list and add it to the opposite list. This <i>moves the items the user clicked on</i>, so that the item beneath the mouse is now some other item that moved into the original item's position. And then the mouse button is released, and you get a <code>WM_LBUTTONUP</code> message for the new item. Now you have two problems: First, the item the user clicked on got a <code>WM_LBUTTONDOWN</code> and no corresponding <code>WM_LBUTTONUP</code>, and second, the new item got a <code>WM_LBUTTONUP</code> with no corresponding <code>WM_LBUTTONDOWN</code>. </p>
<p> You can also get into a similar situation with the keyboard, though it takes more work. For example, if you display a dialog box while the Alt key is still pressed rather than waiting for the release, the Alt key may autorepeat and end up delivered to the dialog box. This prevents the dialog box from appearing since it's stuck in menu mode that was initiated by the Alt key, and it's is waiting for you to finish your menu operation before it will display itself. </p>
<p> Now, this type of mismatch situation is not often a problem, but when it does cause a problem, it's typically a pretty nasty one. This is particularly true if you're using some sort of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/02/11/371042.aspx"> windowless</a> framework that tries to associate mouse and keyboard events with the corresponding windowless objects. When the ups and downs get out of sync, things can get mighty confusing. </p>

		<p>&quot;For example, it might be a customization dialog, with two columns, one showing available objects and another showing objects in use. Clicking on an available object moves it to the list of in-use objects and vice versa.&quot;</p>
<p>I have a hard time coming up with a real-world instance of this behavior. The ones I can think of all either have a command button for moving selected items between the columns, require a double-click to move an item between columns, or both.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t the real reason that it is impossible to discriminate between a mouse click and a mouse drag before the mouse button is released?</p>

		<p>Here&#8217;s a painful situation: Imagine that you have a DataGridView where you want to allow the user to drag and drop items around.. Typically you&#8217;ll call the DoDrag on the CellMouseDown, remove the item from the collection&#8230; And on a DragDrop event you re-add the item to the collection again.. A side-effect of this implementation is that when the user accidentally clicks on an item (but doesn&#8217;t drag it elsewhere) the item is lost&#8230;</p>

		<p>This is one of the things that I really prefer on the Mac when using the mouse: menu&#8217;s (both regular and context) pop up on mousedown, allowing you to &quot;drag&quot; to the menu item and release the mouse to activate.

<p>I always thought the reason this didn&#8217;t happen in Windows is because it is possible to actually drag with the right mouse button and get a drag context menu (e.g. in Explorer you get Copy/Move here and Cancel). I wonder if anybody actually uses that menu.</p>

<p>I do, because I usually can&#8217;t remember the keys for forcing a copy or move, so I just drag with the right mouse button and use the menu.</p>

		<p>I still remember my surprise to discover that double-clicks are actually processed on the second button-down, not on the button-up.</p>
<p>BTW, Windows menu bars work fine with the Mac system of clicking to drop down the menu and letting go of the button to choose the menu item.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that a big reason is that you don&#8217;t actually know what the user intended on the button-down. &nbsp;I.e. for the windows key, you don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re pressing windows-D, or windows-R, so processing on key-down is premature. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>The start menu on XP opens on button down. Lets see how the submit button works on this form. I&#8217;ll click it, move away to cancel, and finish&#8230;</p>

		<p>It seems that combo keys work slightly differently. &nbsp;If I press and hold windows button, no discernible effect. &nbsp;If, while I&#8217;m doing this, I press and hold D, all windows minimize &amp; restore repeatedly as long as I&#8217;m holding them down!</p>

		<p>confused: That&#8217;s auto-repeat. If you hold down a non-modifier key such as D for long enough, the keyboard (not the operating system) sends releases for it automatically and repeatedly until you really release it. This doesn&#8217;t (or shouldn&#8217;t) affect the modifier keys. The key press is not repeated.</p>

		<p>I thought autorepeat was an OS thing. In both Windows and Linux<br />
(well, at least Ubuntu) there is a settings page for how long the<br />
computer should wait until autorepeat comes in and how fast it should<br />
repeat. Okay, this page could be sending these figures to the keyboard,<br />
but I figured the keyboard just sent keydown and keyup events to the OS<br />
and the OS turned them into keydown/keypress/keyup and autorepeated<br />
versions&#8230;</p>
<p>Also it seems a lot of people have different actions on their<br />
computers. I&#8217;m running XP and my start menu doesn&#8217;t come up until I<br />
release the Windows key, and menus do activate on mousedown and I can<br />
select an item on mouseup, but someone has said something to the<br />
contrary for both of these. Weird&#8230;</p>

		<p>Sorry guys. Typematic for USB keyboards is done in software. USB HID protocol does allow for it to be done in the keyboard hardware, however current Windows versions disable this.</p>

		<p>@Nisheeth:</p>
<p>Kind of off topic, but I had a similar problem recently with a toshiba portege 4400. &nbsp;In the end I borrowed a PCMCIA cd-rom which the system (thankfully) was able to boot from.</p>
<p>If you can get boot floppies made, on my system at least, any old USB floppy seems to work.</p>

		<p>It should also be noted that for a button to send a BN_CLICKED notification, you need to both press and release the mouse button over the control.</p>
<p>Like you said, if you press on the button, then move away and release, the action is not performed. But similarly, if you press while not on the button, the move over the button and then release, there&#8217;s also no action (at least the BN_CLICKED notification isn&#8217;t sent; if the app subclassed the button and was actually listening for WM_LBUTTONUP I suppose the action would still take place).</p>

		<p>Oh, how I wish I could convince my users of the wisdom of this scheme. &nbsp;They insist on having many actions happen on the mouse button down, so that they don&#8217;t have to keep the mouse steady while clicking on something. &nbsp;This results in no end of headaches for us in dealing with the difference between click and drag, and right-clicking resulting in a dialog box going away and the control underneath getting a context menu event on the mouse button up.</p>

		<p>By waiting for the buttonup, we can tell the difference between click-and-drag, and a simple click.</p>
<p>Which is important, because we do different things &nbsp;on buttonup when buttonup ends a drag than when it just signals the end of a click.</p>
<p>For instance, Click (without any shift/ctrl etc) selects and item, and DESELECTS all other items.</p>
<p>But click-and-drag, DOES NOT deselect all other items. &nbsp;Not even if you cancelled the drag.</p>
<p>This behavior is so pervasive in good software, that we very often delay operating until the buttonup even when we don&#8217;t have a current need for drag. &nbsp;We do this just so that we don&#8217;t forclose the ability to add drag behavior in the future.</p>

		<p>I just love this feature.</p>
<p>It often happens to me that I click a button and realize that it&#8217;s the wrong one. Then I can just move the mouse out and release the mouse button , that&#8217;s all.</p>

		<p>I think that it&#8217;s on release because of the possibility of combinations which might have been discussed earlier.</p>
<p>For example, alt &lt;release&gt; is different that alt-F &lt;release&gt; and click &lt;release&gt; and control-click &lt;release&gt; are two different actions.</p>

		<p>Think about closing a window. &nbsp;Yes, it always has happened on release. &nbsp;There are a number of times that I have almost mistakenly closed a window; only to catch myself and move the cursor away at the last second and release.</p>
<p>I can honestly see consistency at the heart of &nbsp;this.</p>

		<p>Check out the Preferences dialog in the latest Adobe Reader (8), the OK button performs its action on the release, however the Cancel button perfoms its action on the press. Go figure..</p>

<p>The start menu on XP opens on button down. Lets see how the submit button works on this form. I&#8217;ll click it, move away to cancel, and finish&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;this post. Cool!&quot;</p>
<p>If you mouse click it, your correct.. the OP was referring to pressing the &quot;windows&quot; key on Windows compatible keyboards, in this case he is correct too.. but if he bothered to check the &quot;why&#8217;s&quot; he would have found there are many Shortcuts associated with Pressing this key in combination with other keys..</p>
<p>This may be the stupidest thing I&#8217;ve ever read anyhow, what difference does it really make, if it bothers someone so much that it works this way, change the behavior or don&#8217;t use it.</p>

		<p>As a programmer who did GUIs back in MS-DOS days I would like to say that &quot;Action on release&quot; is easier to implement. It is done naturally by everyone who did it back in those days. Doing action on click is a bit complex. So it is really a matter of laziness.</p>

		<p>&quot;And that&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve always *disliked* about Macs. I think it&#8217;s much easier to click once and then click again. Click and drag produces more stress on your hand (I believe). &nbsp;I suppose it goes along single button mice&#8211;requiring constant keyboard use to do anything more than a basic click.&quot;</p>
<p>So then just click once and click again on the Mac if you want&#8211;it works both ways. :) &nbsp;(OK, only since System 7 point something, so they haven&#8217;t always had it, and it used to be that you had to enable it, but in OS X, there&#8217;s not even an option anymore.)</p>
<p>And surely you know you can hook up any multibutton mouse (well, except PS/2&#8230;) to your Mac, and it works as you would expect. Some, like the newer iMacs, even come with Apple&#8217;s multibutton Mighty Mouse by default. Not to mention that even with a single button mouse, click-and-hold will usually bring up a context menu as well without any need for the keyboard.</p>
<p>Now, a bit more on topic: interesting article! I never thought much about it before.</p>

		<p>Off topic a bit, but in embedded systems, actions are always done on the release.</p>
<p>If 2 buttons are needed for an action, it&#8217;s only possible to know they are both down then register a release of one of them.</p>
<p>Apart from that, timed keypresses can only respond at release&#8230; e.g. how do you know a key has been down for 5 seconds at the press..?</p>

		<p>I noticed this about the action-on-button up back in the 9x days and never thought about it. &nbsp;I think a lot of the explanations given in the comments are good reasons for this to happen. &nbsp;There isn&#8217;t just one or two reasons or the ones that were in the post. &nbsp;There are a lot.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Action-on-Release happens on both Windows and Mac OS. &nbsp;Additionally, selecting menu options in Windows and OS X work exactly the same way. &nbsp;You can either click once, point, click again, or click-hold, drag, release. &nbsp;Both systems support it.</p>
<p>Cool article.</p>

		<p>I thought the action-on-release for buttons was so that computers could render visual feedback during the onclick state so that users would know that they have successfully activated something (as opposed to clicking on a &quot;dead&quot; area of the screen). The visual feedback prevents users from having to guess whether they clicked correctly and the action is just taking too long to complete or whether the software failed to detect their click or their mouse was broken.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
