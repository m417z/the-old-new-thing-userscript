<p> It's mostly asynchronous, but not entirely. </p>
<p> You can read about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/dataexchange/dynamicdataexchange.asp"> how DDE works</a> in MSDN, but since it seems people are reluctant to read the formal documentation, I'll repeat here the points relevant to the discussion. </p>
<p> The DDE process begins with a search for a service provider. This is done by broadcasting the <code>WM_DDE_INITIATE</code> message and collecting the responses. Each server that wishes to respond to the request sends back a <code>WM_DDE_ACK</code> message. The DDE client then chooses which of the servers it wishes to continue the conversation with (possible more than one). The remainder of the DDE conversation is carried out with posted messages, the details of which are not important here. </p>
<p> As you can see, everything in DDE is asynchronous with the exception of the <code>WM_DDE_INITIATE</code>. Why is <code>WM_DDE_INITIATE</code> synchronous? </p>
<p> Remember that DDE was developed back in the 16-bit days, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/06/27/432303.aspx"> when it was safe to broadcast messages</a>. The initiate message and its <code>WM_DDE_ACK</code> replies are synchronous to ensure that the client doesn't have to wait indefinitely to build a list of servers. If it were asynchronous, then the client would post the <code>WM_DDE_INITIATE</code> and then wait "a while" to see if anybody responded. But how does it know when it should give up waiting and just go with whatever it has? What happens if a response comes in after the client already proceeded based on the assumption that that server was unavailable? What if a response comes in five minutes later, when the client had started a <strong>second</strong> DDE discovery query? Would that response have been to the first or the second discovery broadcast? </p>
<p> In particular, it is important for the client to know whether there are any servers out there at all, because the way the shell <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_basics/shell_basics_extending/fileassociations/fa_verbs.asp"> interprets DDE-based file associations</a> is first to attempt a <code>WM_DDE_INITIATE</code> with the application and topic specified in the registration. If no server is found, then it launches the server manually and then tries to connect to the server via DDE a second time. (The second time should work, since the responsible server was explicitly launched!) </p>

		<p>My first windows project (back when 3.0 was released) was to write a DDE server. Back then being DDE-compliant meant that you worked successfully with Excel &#8211; all others were hit-or-miss. Most implementations sucked and the amount of weird issues were enormous. I vaguely recall some problem with DDE_TERMINATE and when you could close/delete the windows used in the conversation.</p>
<p>I remember needing to disassemble NETDDE to figure out some problems &#8211; it was buggy too. </p>
<p>The surprising thing was that if you used a good custom protocol/data format the performance was actually not bad at all. Posting a message between windows is fairly efficient (and still used in many cases); the usual performance killer was the data format. Of course the protocol as awful in many other ways, but it was useful for getting people used to the notion that applications had useful things to say to each other.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s somewhere I could look up the answer to this, but I admit it: I&#8217;m lazy.</p>
<p>After the shell has launched the application that provides the DDE server, how does it know when that app is ready to respond to the DDE broadcast? Does it just keep sending out WM_DDE_INITIATE every n seconds until something answers? What if it&#8217;s misconfigured and the launched app doesn&#8217;t provide a DDE server at all?</p>
<p>(As you can probably tell, I managed to avoid ever learning about DDE!)</p>

		<p>I hate DDE. I wished all programms just launch by looking up the file-association and starting that programm. If the programm launches an second instance: GREAT! I just want that.<br />
<br />If the programm has some kind of fear of running twice: It shall take care of that problem itself and find it&#8217;s existing process and transfer execution to it.<br />
<br />Not that it can do anything against that happening anyway.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be possible to create a tool that walks through the registry and exchanges all the DDE-stuff with just launching the EXE-file and passing the data file as first command line parameter?</p>
<p>I feel this would make my computer much more responsive!</p>

		<p>I doubt that would make your computer any more responsive. &nbsp;Applications have quite a bit of overhead involved in launching, much more than the overhead involved in DDE.</p>

		<p>@Christian: If you want to make your computer more responsive, find and eliminate the apps that dont respond to broadcast windows messages quickly.</p>

		<p>The MSDN page linked to with &quot;interprets DDE-based file associations &quot; is a bit out of date and should be updated, it says nothing about per user registered verbs.<br /></p>

<p>It appears this makes DDE synchronous if you&#8217;re using DDEML.DLL</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
