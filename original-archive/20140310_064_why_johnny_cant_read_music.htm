		<p>A sousaphone is commonly known as a marching band tuba. So&#8230;</p>

		<p>While they can be played somewhat interchangeably (similar/same fingerings, clef, etc), they are distinct instruments with their own properties and sound.</p>
<p>Another example would be a &quot;standard&quot; baritone (a.k.a. euphonium; looks like a small tuba) versus a &quot;marching&quot; baritone (looks like a big trumpet). They play similarly, but the tone quality is quite different, among other things.</p>

		<p>People use the incorrect name for instruments all the time. &nbsp;I can&#39;t tell how many times I&#39;ve heard people call a viola a violin, a fluglehorn a trumpet, a marimba a xylophone, etc. &nbsp;I was a professional musician for 15 years &#8212; played electric bass. &nbsp;During that time, I bet I had 100&#39;s of people ask me what kind of guitar I played. &nbsp;It&#39;s just the way it is. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If the maker refers to an instrument as a guitar, I say it&#39;s a guitar.</p>

		<p>@ dave, did you see that Fender calls it a &quot;Bass Guitar&quot;? &nbsp;They did not call it a guitar nor did they call it a bass.</p>
<p>BTW, I have two &quot;bass guitars&quot; &#8212; both originals that I purchased. &nbsp;A 1964 Hofner 500/1 and a 1976 Fender Jazz. &nbsp;The Jazz bass is well worn, but in good condition, but my Hofner is in pristine condition.</p>

		<p>@Random User 20943753</p>
<p>It&#39;s even more complicated than you describe: baritone and euphonium are two distinct instruments. &nbsp;The distinction is in the</p>
<p>ratios: the baritone&#39;s tubing is smaller in diameter and stays cylindrical longer than that of the euphonium. &nbsp;The distinction </p>
<p>has largely blurred in the US, but the British Brass Band utilizes both the baritone and euphonium for different functions within</p>
<p>the same ensemble.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
