<p>One of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/02/08/10392028.aspx"> differences between standard-mode Windows and enhanced-mode Windows</a> was what happened when you hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd>. Since 16-bit Windows applications are co-operatively multi-tasked, it is easy to determine whether the system is responding, and if not, it is also easy to identify the application which is responsible. In that case, Windows gave you options to close the non-responsive application, restart the computer, or cancel.</p>
<p> During this time period, Steve Ballmer was head of the Systems Division, and he paid a visit to the Windows team to see what they were up to, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/10/21/9910264.aspx"> as is the wont of many executives</a>.&sup1; When they showed him the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd> feature, he nodded thoughtfully and added, "This is nice, but I don't like the text of the message. It doesn't sound right to me." </p>
<p> "Okay, Steve. If you think you can do a better job, then go for it." Unlike <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/10/08/10454920.aspx"> some other executive</a>, Steve took up the challenge, and a few days later, he emailed what he thought the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd> screen should say. </p>
<p> The text he came up with was actually quite good, and it went into the product pretty much word for word. </p>

<p> &sup1; It occurred to me only as I wrote up this entry that people took the phrase <i>Right on top of my notepad</i> from the earlier story literally: There was a chair, the chair had a notepad on its seat, Bill sat in the chair (on top of the notepad). That interpretation never occurred to me. From the description in the previous paragraph, it was apparent to me that the notepad was on a desk, and Bill's choice of seat blocked access to the notepad. (<i>I.e.</i>, the manager would have to reach around Bill to get the notepad.) The person telling the story is not a native English speaker, so there may have been a preposition translation issue. </p>

		<p>Isn&#39;t reboot a kind of global solution to the local problem here, unless the user is reasonably sure that the unstable application has already caused system-wide instability? I&#39;d expect the option to be offered if ENTER is unable to solve the problem, but not immediately.</p>

		<p>If you used Windows 3.1 you would know what once a program went unstable odds were pretty good the entire system was going to go down or stop working reliably. &nbsp;The fact that all processes shared the same memory space meant that one rogue process could corrupt everything in the system.</p>

		<p>Yes, as SimonRev says, when an application hanged in Windows 3.x, it was a matter of luck. If it hanged because an error of logic (an infinite loop or something like that), most times you could terminate it and continue with your session. But if it crashed because of memory corruption, many times you would close it only to find that the next application was also hung. It happened a lot, specially if you used badly written applications or utilities.</p>
<p>Windows 95&#39;s space address isolation helped a lot. But AFAIK, for compatibility and performance reasons it had to maintain the first 64 KB of memory shared, with the master interruption vector table in it. Because of that sometimes badly-behaving applications bought down the entire system, too. Those were the days of the &quot;Save early, save often&quot; motto! I can&#39;t say I miss them.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>It wasn&#39;t compatibility or performance. It was <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/01/12/10114521.aspx">to work around a CPU bug</a>. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>The main problem was that &quot;it is also easy to identify the application which is responsible&quot; is a lie. It often occured that Windows decided that there wasn&#39;t any unresponding application, and there were&#39;t anywhere a list of applications so you could choose one and kill it.</p>
<p>&quot;Press CTRL+ALT+DEL again&quot; was the only viable option.</p>

Windows president Steven Sinofsky kept him abreast of the team’s progress, but Ballmer met with Larson-Green only twice during the development process, and he never got together with the team to green-light the design.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Raymond: thanks for clarifying that! I remember reading about it in an article from PC World that analyzed Windows 3.11, Windows 95, Windows NT and OS/2, explained their architectural differences and compared their performance, stability and security. If I remember correctly, it claimed that the 64 KB window was there because many Windows 3.x tools directly patched the interrupt table, and simulating the patches in software would have slowed the whole system. But your explanation makes a lot more sense for a design decision.</p>
<p>@Yuhong Bao: Yes, that&#39;s right. But the base 64 KB hole is very dangerous: write to an object&#39;s property through a NULL pointer and bang! You overwrote the RTC interruption vector and took down the scheduler, freezing the entire system. On the other hand, the 2-3GB area was a lot more difficult to be hit by a bug. It contained the 16-bit tasks, so most of the memory corruption in that area would be cause from segment overruns in 16-bit Windows applications, and you could basically ignore it if you only ran 32-bit software.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>16-bit and 32-bit Windows applications would take an access violation if they tried to deference a NULL pointer. In order to whack the interrupt table, they would have to do something like allocate a selector and set its base to zero. Not something you can do by accident. -Raymond</em>]</div>

<div class="post">[<em>Not sure what you mean by &quot;the first page was unmapped&quot; &#8211; as noted, the first page must be mapped phys=lin due to a CPU erratum.

The question is whether the program was a 16-bit protected-mode application, a 16-bit real-mode application, or a 32-bit application. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>To suppress another question, most of my 16 bits were complied with LARGE memory model, so pointers really were 32 bits long even in 16 bit mode. malloc() could allocate more than 64k RAM (not all at once obviously).</p>

<p>I really like the &quot;history&quot; posts. This one adds the bonus to show that &quot;big bosses&quot; occasionally do hands-on work which is visible not only in the general sense but even (nearly) word-for-word, and that in a part of the OS that&#39;s not the polished front door.</p>

		<p>This story reminds me of a valuable lesson I learned as a fresh graduate. &nbsp;I had received an awfully written block of text from my manager who needed me to put it into the product. &nbsp;He must have gotten the text from marketing, apparently from someone barely literate, so I was like, &quot;Ugh no I have never read anything more poorly written and I&#39;d be embarrassed to put this in. &nbsp;This makes no sense and I can&#39;t believe we were actually given this text in a serious professional environment.&quot; &nbsp;My manager was a totally cool guy and said, &quot;OK, fix it up and send it to me for approval and we&#39;ll use your text.&quot;</p>
<p>I did so, and the text in the product ended up being quite good if I do say so myself. &nbsp;Clear, concise, and easy on the eyes.</p>
<p>It was years later that it hit me, though. &nbsp;He didn&#39;t get the text from marketing. &nbsp;He almost certainly wrote it himself when told to do so by some higher up. &nbsp;I still feel bad about how nasty I was about it.</p>
<p>Now the only time I bash someone&#39;s work is when I&#39;m looking at some code that I know for sure it was me who wrote it. &nbsp;Or if it was written by the guy who was fired. &nbsp;Because you know, everything is the fault of the guy who was fired.</p>

		<p>@Yuhong Bao, @Antonio &#39;Grijan&#39;: And to get Windows 95 running in 4 MB of RAM, the system DLLs, like USER32.DLL and KERNEL32.DLL, were loaded above 2GB. &nbsp;This made it really easy for an application to take down the entire system by overwriting a critical system DLL. &nbsp;I can&#39;t imagine how many system crashes could have been avoided if this decision had went the other way.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>As you noted, this was a compromise in order to fit into 4MB of RAM. But you don&#39;t have to guess how things would have been had the decision been made to raise the minimum memory requirement in exchange for greater robustness.

		<p>This is my attempt to clarify the story about Bill Gates and the notepad.</p>
<p>Before Bill came, I spent some time figuring out the agenda and wrote a list of bullet points on a notepad. I &quot;cleaned&quot; my desk, and placed the notepad in the chair to my right so that I could easily take a quick peek if necessary. I ran the demos a couple of times to make sure they were still working. Everything was ready.</p>
<p>A few hours later, it was demo time. Bill came into my office, and after some introductions he decided to sit down.</p>
<p>On my side of the desk.</p>
<p>To my right.</p>
<p>Right on top of my notepad.</p>
<p>I screamed inside my head. This is the sort of thing that only happens in the movies.</p>

<p>cc:Mail was around since the mid 80s (later bought by Lotus). &nbsp;IBM PROFS (now OfficeVision) since the early 80s. &nbsp;Lotus Notes in 1989. &nbsp;Microsofts first Mail product (originally called Microsoft Mail) was introduced in 1991 (Exchange a couple of years later). &nbsp;From a corporate point of view &#8211; e-mail WAS definitely widespread by 1992. &nbsp;The only people I can recall who didn&#39;t use e-mail at this time were executives of non-technology companies who relied on their secretaries to print their e-mail (which was true in the company I was working for at the time).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
