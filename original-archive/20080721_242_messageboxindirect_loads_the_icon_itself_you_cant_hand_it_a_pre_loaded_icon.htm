<p>Commenter <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#519342"> 8</a> wants to know how to tell the <code>MessageBoxIndirect</code> function to use an existing <code>HICON</code> instead of pointing it to an icon resource.</p>
<p> You can't. </p>
<p> The <code>MessageBoxIndirect</code> loads the icon itself. You can't hand it a pre-loaded icon. </p>
<p> Of course, it's hardly rocket science to write your own <code>MessageBoxWithMyIcon</code> function that lets you use whatever icon you want. There's no law that says all Yes/No dialogs must use the <code>MessageBox</code> function. Feel free to write your own. </p>
<p> The <code>MessageBox</code> and <code>MessageBoxIndirect</code> functions are just convenience functions. They don't create new functionality; they don't do anything you couldn't already do yourself. You can have a template dialog box that you use for "generic" purposes and set the icon and text yourself. Or, if you're really adventuresome, you can <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/29/412577.aspx"> generate a dialog template on the fly</a>. </p>
<p> The <code>MessageBox</code> and <code>MessageBoxIndirect</code> functions never aspired to be "everything anybody could ever do with a dialog box." They just provide some basic functionality that lots of people find useful. If you need more functionality, then you can always write it yourself. (There's already a function for "everything anybody could ever do with a standard Win32 dialog box": It's called, um, <code>DialogBox</code>.) </p>
<p> Windows&nbsp;Vista introduces a considerably more customizable "message box"-type dialog known as a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms650910.aspx"> Task Dialog</a>; you may want to give that one a try. </p>

		<p>For those who are really insistent on using the native message box but with a custom icon, you could go for a CBT hook. Probably overkill on Vista where you have task dialogs (that Raymond mentioned)</p>

		<p>For information, there is a MessageBoxIndirect function which accepts a customized icon in the parameter.</p>
<p>No such luck with MFC&#8217;s AfxMessageBox, though.</p>

		<p>Hey jiang sheng,</p>
<p>Raymond&#8217;s post is about the fact that MessageBoxIndirect won&#8217;t accept an HICON. My suggestion to use a CBT hook was so people could use an existing HICON.</p>

		<p>Several years ago I tried to replicate MessageBox() with my own code. &nbsp;Maybe I was missing something obvious, but I didn&#8217;t find it to be very easy: MessageBox() has lots of little details that are fairly noticeable if you don&#8217;t match them exactly.</p>
<p>In the end, I ended up going with a hook too.</p>
<p>While I know you (Raymond) don&#8217;t make the decisions about such things (and I&#8217;m sure the Microsoft lawyers have a habit of making even seemingly simple things incredibly complex), if MessageBox() is &quot;just [a] convenience function&quot;, then why isn&#8217;t the source code readily available to the average developer?</p>

		<p>Daniel, if you have access to VS 2008, you could try using the recently released update to VS 2008 that allows debugging right into the .NET framework&#8217;s source code.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2008/01/16/configuring-visual-studio-to-debug-net-framework-source-code.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2008/01/16/configuring-visual-studio-to-debug-net-framework-source-code.aspx</a></p>
<p>(the post is a bit old, and I haven&#8217;t tried it recently myself either&#8230;but it worked like a charm before).</p>
<p>If the above works, you can look into the MessageBox code. Although, note that the code is only for debugging purposes and there&#8217;s some copyright involved in copying that.</p>

		<p>If you were missing something obvious, then so was I (and I was only trying to replicate it on Windows 3.1, which should have been simpler), but it took me about 70 lines of code to generate a dialog item template from the message box parameters.</p>

		<p>One of my favorite features of message boxes is the ability to press Ctrl-C and copy the text of the message box to the clipboard. I find this to be a lot more useful than taking a screen shot of the window. Hopefully, anyone that decides to create his own MessageBox replacement would have the good manners to replicate this feature. I get really grumpy when I encounter a &quot;fake&quot; message box that doesn&#8217;t implement this.</p>

		<p>I too use a CBT hook to customize MessageBox &#8211; like changing the button text (although that&#8217;s easy anyway), the icon etc. &nbsp;I also have an option where it auto times-out :- it &#8216;answers&#8217; with whatever button has the focus [if one does]. &nbsp;This has been very popular so far, i.e., no complaints like &#8216;where&#8217;d the Message Box go?!&#8217;</p>

		<p>Coincidentally, here&#8217;s a code sample on how to hook a dialog box so you can change stuff in it:</p>

		<p>Sorry again for my late reply, but thank you very much!</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, I already did write my own MessageBox function, which also implements the ability to use verbs on the buttons (like on Mac OS). And yes, I&#8217;ve looked at Task Dialogs too. I&#8217;m even looking into backporting them so I can also add it to wine.</p>
<p>The reason I asked at the time was because I was writing a very simple application which didn&#8217;t involve any &quot;magic&quot; (a dialog, a socket&#8230; wow). But today I don&#8217;t even work for the same company anymore.</p>
<p>@Paul: Thanks, I didn&#8217;t know that. I&#8217;ll fix that in my version right away :)</p>

		<p>Nitpick: &gt;you can&#8217;t hand it a pre-loaded icon</p>
<p>Sure you can! Just LoadImage it with the LR_SHARED flag beforehand. Not that that solves anything.</p>

		<p>You might also consider using a TaskDialog wrapper that also works on Windows prior to Vista if you don&#8217;t want to require Vista. See the cpp/h file I have done in the link above.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
