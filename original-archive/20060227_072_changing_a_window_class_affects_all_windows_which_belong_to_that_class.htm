<p>Sometimes you need to state the obvious, and that's fine. You can learn a lot from the obvious. For example, the first topic in my PDC talk consisted of simply stating the obvious.</p>
<p> Occasionally, when you state the obvious, you have to follow up by stating the obvious. </p>
<p> When I pointed out that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/05/25/421707.aspx"> the effect of <code>SetCursor</code> lasts only until the next <code>SetCursor</code></a>, one commenter proposed as an alternative solution to the problem of how to prevent the cursor from reverting to the arrow, </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> What about calling <code>SetClassLongPtr()</code> with the <code>GCLP_HCURSOR</code> param? Is this an acceptable alternative, or does this have issues of its own?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Being busy is a state of a particular window instance, not a state of the window class. Therefore, the setting of the cursor must be done by the window instance, not by the window class. If you change a window class, then it affects all windows which belong to that class. In particular, changing the class cursor changes the cursor for all windows that belong to the class. </p>
<p> In other words, consider the case where you have two windows on the screen that belong to the window class. One of the windows becomes busy, so you change the class cursor to an hourglass. When the user moves the mouse over the window that is busy processing, the cursor turns to an hourglass, as you would expect. But when the user moves the mouse over the window that is not doing any processing, <strong>the cursor will turn to an hourglass there also</strong>, even though that window is perfectly fine. </p>
<p> It is important to understand the scope of what one is changing. Don't make a global change to solve a local problem. </p>

		<p>So another workaround would be to have a window class for each used mouse pointer, and then reassign window classes instead, LOL ^_^</p>

		<p>You laugh, but I think that creating a new window class (or window of a special window class) isn&#8217;t a terrible way to go.</p>
<p>You throw your invisible pane in front of the window in question, it changes the cursor&#8230;</p>

		<p>Maybe I am missing the obvious, but if SetCursor only is valid until the next WM_SETCURSOR, then why have SetCursor and just return the HCURSOR in the WM_SETCURSOR message?</p>
<p>It seems that having the routine has caused confusion. &nbsp;Obviously, I am not saying that Windows should change. &nbsp;I am just wondering why we have SetCursor.</p>

		<p>If your window is too busy to process messages, then it won&#8217;t be able to resopnd to WM_SETCURSOR.</p>

		<p>Related question: anyone know if there is an api for causing a WM_SETCURSOR to be generated? Or is this a case of putting the pieces together yourself? I.e., find the window under the cursor, put together the params for WM_SETCURSOR, and send or post.</p>

		<p>pUnnk:</p>
<p>The following trick has been successful for this kind of thing from NT 4.0 through XP&#8230;</p>
<p>POINT ptCursor;</p>
<p>if (GetCursorPos(&amp;ptCursor))<br />
<br />    SetCursorPos(ptCursor.x, ptCursor.y);</p>
<p>This seems to trick the system into treating this like a normal mouse move. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve used this in a scrolling window to get the mouse cursor to update while scrolling with the keyboard (i.e. the mouse stays in sync with what&#8217;s under it)</p>

		<p>Why is cursor associated with class and not window?</p>
<p>Many programs do call SetCursor on every WM_MOUSEMOVE, is this unrecommended?</p>

<br />&gt; Many programs do call SetCursor on every<br />
<br />&gt; WM_MOUSEMOVE, is this unrecommended?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it necessary? &nbsp;Consider for example Internet Explorer. &nbsp;If the mouse moves to an area of plain text, the mouse cursor looks almost like a text cursor. &nbsp;If the mouse moves to a link, the cursor looks like a finger pointing. &nbsp;If the mouse moves to most other parts of a page, the cursor looks like an arrow. &nbsp;If the mouse moves to a divider of some sort, the cursor looks like a different kind of double-ended arrow to indicate that the user can move the divider.</p>
<p>&gt; Why is cursor associated with class and not<br />
<br />&gt; window?</p>
<p>Yeah when you find that out, please let me know too.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
