		<p>Hey, have you ever actually tried to get a Bluetooth device to work with a computer? &nbsp;If you had, you&#8217;d know that the alcohol (or some other sedative) is mandatory.</p>
<p>(See how good I was by saying &quot;a computer&quot; and not &quot;Windows&quot;? &nbsp;D&#8217;oh!)</p>

		<p>I think they are all wearing bluetooth devices but the webmaster posted the wrong pic from the photo shoot. &nbsp;Note that you cannot see one ear on each of the women. &nbsp;It&#8217;s like when you take a pic and get someone with their eyes closed.</p>

		<p>If you squint, you can make out that one of the women has a blue tooth. There is no truth in the rumour (spready by a rival company) that the other two have yellow teeth.</p>

		<p>None of the women are Taiwanese or even Asian. Wonder why a Taiwanese company choose that pic. (It&#8217;s probably a stock photo, BTW)</p>
<p>Many IT companies have home pages with similar eye-candy, usually a Flash intro.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s OK &#8212; our company (which does metal stamping) has a dumb stock baseball image on our home page. &nbsp;The fact that that has absolutely nothing to do with metal stampings didn&#8217;t stop the generic marketing company that we outsourced our home-page-creation to. &nbsp;;-)</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not just the booze that&#8217;s odd. Almost the entire thing sits in a single image. If the width of the browser is too small, you get a horizontal scrollbar. If it&#8217;s too wide, it looks cut off.</p>
<p>In Opera Mini, atleast the imagemap part is preserved and can be easily navigated, but in NetFront with SmartFit on, the entire image is resized and the text becomes illegible. With SmartFit off, the image is readable but navigation is very difficult (I can&#8217;t get to Asia or Europe).</p>
<p>Also notice the copyright statement is in the middle, and it&#8217;s not updated. Atleast when you put it in a prominent place, use &nbsp; a date function so you don&#8217;t have to manually change it every Jan 1st. But it&#8217;s an image, so it&#8217;s not that simple in this case.</p>
<p>Then in the bottom, there&#8217;s a visitor counter. Besides being an image as well, its rather pointless.</p>

		<p>This company&#8217;s still trying to use the promise of sex with girls to sell its products to males. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder who talked them out of having the girls in bikini&#8217;s looking sweaty on the beach with their alcohol?</p>
<p>Luckily, &nbsp;being a girl, &nbsp;I don&#8217;t purchase with my dick so I can actually make decisions based on products, &nbsp;thank heavens they never draped good looking men over cars Or I&#8217;d be driving something other than the Honda civic.</p>

		<p>Never mind. I went to the site and it looks more like normal women laughing about some random crap than a sex comeon. Wendy, you gotta get your eyes checked. This looks more like they&#8217;re selling to women &#8211; buy our nebulous stuff and you can sit around and gab with your friends what with all the new free time.</p>

<p>Check out the flash ad &#8211; they&#8217;re pitching the bluetooth stuff as fashion/tech, which is fine by me. I&#8217;m tired of all the borg-lite people walking around with glowing blue ears. At least these things are vaguely subtle.</p>

<p>Honda civics are quite environmentally friendly though, not far off a Prius IIRC. In fact if you factor in the energy required to build one, I think they&#8217;re probably slightly better.</p>
<p>So driving one will make the world a better place for future generations &#8211; i.e your or at least someone else&#8217;s kids. So sex is involved but just with a few more levels of indirection.</p>

		<p>I do find it mildly amusing that the guys can use the sexist thing in a humerous way without being criticised (see below examples). &nbsp;yet when little self-confessed female me makes a comment remark from an alternative perspective &nbsp;I get told to get my eyes checked and that in 30years time I will have 15 cats and no human contact. &nbsp;Sigh, &nbsp;better start stocking up on cat food now then &nbsp;;-)</p>
<p>Un questioned humour in this thread (prior to my meagre contribution) that was based on a male sexual perspective:</p>
<p>TravisO: &quot;It doesn&#8217;t matter what they&#8217;re selling. &nbsp;When have hot chicks and alcohol steered us wrong before? &nbsp;Never!</p>

		<p>I bought several of BlueTake&#8217;s products, and, so far, ZERO females have requested to drink alcohol with me. I&#8217;ll give it a few more days, but I&#8217;m thinking I need to return it, because this is obviously false advertising.</p>

		<p>I think a Nitpick&#8217;s Corner is needed here:</p>
<p>Raymond does not endorse patriarchy or sex.</p>
<p>There, *slaps hands*, done and done.</p>
<p>Honestly, the girls, though not having anything to do with the product in question, are, if the people using the shot were paying attention, good for playing both genders.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like they are stripped down to bikini&#8217;s spraying their booze over each other. &nbsp;But they are women, and men will think, however subconsciously &quot;oh, I associate this product with attractive women, hurrah&quot;. &nbsp;Women, on the other hand, will see it as &quot;oh, women, like me, enjoy this product, so I&#8217;ll enjoy it too&quot;. &nbsp;Two demographics with one stone.</p>

		<p>Why focus on the alcohol, Ray? That picture has women, a sofa, smiling, glass, clthes and so on in it. None of those items is bluetooth specific, yet you focus on the alcohol. Sounds like you&#8217;re bringing some baggage to the picture that&#8217;s interfering with your assessment.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
