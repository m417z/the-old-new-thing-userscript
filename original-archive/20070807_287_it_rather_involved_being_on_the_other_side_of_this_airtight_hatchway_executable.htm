In the category of dubious vulnerability, I submit the following
(paraphrased) report:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
I discovered that if I take an EXE file and corrupt its header,
then when I try to run the EXE file, the process starts up
and then crashes.
I used the information in the crash dialog to direct
further investigations, noting that the specific crash location
could be controlled by modifying particular bytes in the EXE.
Finally, I was able to put all the details together to form
an exploit:
I modified a block of bytes in the EXE file to consist of
code which opens a network socket and connects it to a command shell,
then modified the header to point to those bytes.
When I run the EXE, the exploit code runs,
and I can connect to the network socket from another computer
and control the command shell.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yeah, that's great, but what's the vulnerability?
What you did was take a program that you have write permission to
and change the code in it to run your exploit.
If you can modify an EXE file, then you may as well just
replace the entire contents of the file with
the bytes of <code>PWNZ0RD.EXE</code>.
In other words,
modifying bytes here and there is just a very slow, inefficient,
and unnecessarily complicated way of doing this:
</p>
<pre>
copy pwnz0rd.exe victim.exe
</pre>
<p>Then when the user runs the infected program, they're really running
the <code>PWNZ0RD.EXE</code> program, and your so-called exploit
can do whatever it wants.
That's a lot easier than trying to modify a dozen bytes here,
a dozen bytes there.
</p>
<p>
In order to trigger the vulnerability,
the user has to run the compromised program,
but a program is already arbitrary code.
No need to be so sneaky about it.
It's sort of a tautology:
"Here's my clever way to get the user to run my code.
Step&nbsp;1: Write some code.
Step&nbsp;2: Get the user to run it."
</p>
<p>
Of course, if this corrupted EXE file created other types of problems,
such as crashing Explorer or triggering a buffer overflow
when the user tried to view its properties,
then you'd be onto something.
Or if you could somehow avoid detection by not altering the digital signature,
then that'd be interesting as well.
But if the only way to trigger code injection is to run the injected
code, then that's not really all that interesting.
You just found a roundabout way of creating a Trojan horse.</p>

		<p>Actually, Raymond, it&#8217;s a valid concern&#8230; for antivirus software (not operating systems, of course). It&#8217;s a family of techniques, collectively called Original Entrypoint Obfuscation (OEP), that can conceal where, exactly, the malicious code is hidden inside a trojaned/infected executable, making static analysis harder. I humbly suggest you just outed a legitimate, little-documented OEP technique :-)</p>

		<p>Raymond, you might want to read MS07-040, one of the critical vulnerabilities fixed is very similar your allegedly dubious vulnerability.</p>
<p>Also, given the mind boggling complexity of Windows, it is quite possible that a few of these allegedly non-security holes can be combined into a real security hole.</p>
<p>BTW, I happen to have seen part of the mail exchange between MSRC and the discoverer of the .NET PE Loader vulnerability and it took quite a lot of convincing before MSRC realized that there was a vulnerability. From the outside this (and your post here) looks very much like arrogance.</p>

		<p>The critical difference with this &quot;vulnerability&quot; and MS07-040 is that in the PE Vulnerability, you are loading managed .NET code that escapes the sandbox and results in arbitrary code execution on the system. &nbsp;This is an escalation of privilege. &nbsp;In Raymond&#8217;s vulnerability, the user gains no additional privileges; they already had write access to the file.</p>
<p>Its like putting &quot;del /q /s /f c:&quot; in a batch file and then saying, &quot;Look! &nbsp;This batch file erased my programs! &nbsp;Its vulnerable!&quot; &nbsp;Of course it did. &nbsp;Thats what you TOLD it to do.</p>
<p>ps: &nbsp;When will Microsoft fix the newly discovered &quot;DEL Command can erase files&quot; vulnerability?</p>

		<p>This idea is not quite original, but I think there still might be something in it.</p>
<p>Namely, if you as a regular (non-admin) user manage to modify an executable (say system service) and the modified copy gets loaded and executed on next reboot, then you can access the internet and do all sorts of other things you normally couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Raymond said that it would be easier to overwrite a file, but if you overwrite say SPOOLSV.EXE and the user can&#8217;t print anymore you have just blown your cover.</p>
<p>One thing I must admit is that this &#8220;exploit&#8221; existed a long time ago, viruses used it extensively by inserting themselves into executables and after doing their work, they allowed the original program to run.</p>

		<p>This is why Vista 64&#8217;s driver signing is pointless from a security standpoint. &nbsp;In order to load a rootkit, your Trojan must have administrator access already. &nbsp;If you have administrator access, you&#8217;ve already won.</p>
<p>Administrators that aren&#8217;t administrators &#8211; Microsoft might as well try to make water not wet.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
