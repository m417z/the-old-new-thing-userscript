<p>Commenter John Topley wondered <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#511960"> why clearing document history also clears Run history</a>. Simple: Because people wanted it to.</p>
<p> Originally, the button merely erased your recent document history, but with the increasing paranoia over what records the computer kept on your past usage, people began to expect more and even filed beta bugs saying, "I cleared my document history, but I went to <i>Location&nbsp;X</i> and the names of documents I used recently was still visible." </p>
<p> I guess these people were afraid of being raided by the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/25/141254.aspx"> F*I</a>, or more likely (but nobody will admit to it) by their spouse. </p>

		<p>Of course, if one&#8217;s spouse is even a little savvy then clearing the MRU list and Run history looks a little shady&#8230;</p>
<p>My currently favored hypothetical method for hiding my tracks is saving the MRU list before suspicious activity, and restoring it afterwards.</p>

		<p>This is amusing. &nbsp;I remember in the very late 90&#8217;s and turn of the century the big boom in software that &quot;scrubbed&quot; your machine to remove your surfing habits, etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no telling how much money those guys made.</p>

		<p>@Ramesh and Graham,</p>
<p>I found the path as you say, not sure why regedit search did not find my string&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, I see in the XP dialog &quot;Customize Classic Start Menu&quot; the text &quot;To remove records of recently accessed documents, programs, and Web sites click Clear&quot;. &nbsp;No mention of the Run dialog. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why I was never sure why my entries would occasionally disappear. &nbsp;(Unless there&#8217;s another clear action that I&#8217;m not remembering?)</p>

		<p>My favorite method of not letting others access my personal data is:</p>
<p>User Profiles</p>
<p>combined with:</p>
<p>NT Security</p>
<p>No need to track down hundreds of different data stores and constantly clear them at my own trouble and inconvenience, yet I can let others use my computer relatively safely.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of sharing a user profile and Windows account with somebody else? It baffles me why people do that to themselves.</p>

		<p>Just a friendly reminder:</p>
<p>I imagine there &quot;sanitize&quot; things do nothing (i.e. they delete registry keys, but don&#8217;t zero the space on disk and much less rewrite it several times), so they give &quot;usermode protection&quot;. Rewriting the sensitive data with zeros before deleting it would give &quot;kernel mode protection&quot;, and you&#8217;d be safe unless the HDD is disassembled (or, on certain circumstances, its firmware flashed with a special version).</p>

<p>Or you just click on Safari -&gt; private browsing, and it won&#8217;t even record your porn surfing habits.</p>

<p>On Windows, it&#8217;s quite easy. Zip everything, rename it to &lt;random letters&gt;32.dll and drop it in your System32 directory.</p>
<p>Or, like me, you can just store your porn collection in /media/pr0n on your shared network drive.</p>

<p>The Run dialog is used to access documents, programs and Web sites, right?</p>
<p>The Run dialog records entries you type.</p>
<p>Hence, it records some recent accesses to documents, programs and Web sites.</p>
<p>The dialog says &quot;To remove records of&#8230;&quot; which implies that it removes all of them.</p>
<p>So, it has to remove the RunMRU.</p>

		<p>Not totally true.</p>
<p>On my XP, some URLs remain in the run dialog even after a clear of document history until I also clear IE history &#8211; which is fun considering they are URLs I visited with Firefox.. </p>
<p>They mostly are Windows Media URLs, so I guess WM records them in the same history of IE *and* it suggests them as autocompletes in the run dialog.</p>

		<p>@SuperKoko:</p>
<p>&quot;You forgot about NT encryption.</p>
<p>Unless you prevent physical accesses to your computer, it&#8217;s possible to read the non-encrypted data.&quot;</p>
<p>No, I didn&#8217;t forget. NT Security is good enough for my typical situations because I trust my friends who use my computer not to attempt to wholesale break in to the NT Security system and attempt to gain an administrator account (or just steal the computer). I just don&#8217;t want them running across my data during their casual use of the computer.</p>
<p>And anyway, NTFS file encryption would not be completely effective if they had physical access, because they could install a keylogger for the next time I used the computer to get my password.</p>
<p>@anonymous:</p>
<p>&quot;Rewriting the sensitive data with zeros before deleting it would give &quot;kernel mode protection&quot;, and you&#8217;d be safe unless the HDD is disassembled&quot;</p>
<p>Not true. The data could have previously been at a different location on disk due to defragmentation, and this data would not be deleted.</p>
<p>Working secure erase requires an extremely complex implementation. To perform well, it requires techniques like using multiple levels of key indirection, as well as techniques to account for securely erasing previous versions of data in a file that were not &quot;securely&quot; overwritten (multiple times with random data). The best general approach involves implementation at the file system level and keeping all files encrypted, and then securely erasing keys instead of the data. There are many more difficulties than listed here and it&#8217;s not trivial.</p>

		<p>For those that think it doesn’t work, clearing the Run dialog does not take effect until you restart the shell (reboot, logoff-logon, restart Explorer, etc.)</p>
<p>The Run dialog makes no distinction between apps, links, URLs, etc. It saves anything that has been run from it as long as it can be resolved. That is, it will save “calc” the same as it saves “<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.google.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/</a>”, however it will not save “blajsds” (assuming that there is nothing by that name in the PATH).</p>
<p>As for wiping traces, I prefer the opposite approach. I log the crap out of everything. I have logs and traces of everything that I can think of so that I know exactly what I have done and when. That way, not only do I have a record of my time (and life), but I can go back and find something much easier than trying to remember it. The only thing that I would wipe is the recent this-and-that folders because I don’t use them, so they take space for nothing. Of course since the Run dialog gets wiped, I don’t do that and just turn it off instead. (Maybe I should reactivate it…)</p>

		<p>(Just to be clear, I didn’t mean that the Run dialog saves EXEs, URLs, shortcuts, etc. in the same place, just that it saves them so long as they can be executed by ShellExecute (doesn’t give the “Windows cannot find…” message)—which is true for all URLs whether they are valid or not since the shell “executes” them simply by passing the URL to the http protocol handler.)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
