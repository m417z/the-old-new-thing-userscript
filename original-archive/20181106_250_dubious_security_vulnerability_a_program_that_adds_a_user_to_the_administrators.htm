<p>
A security vulnerability report indicated
that Windows was vulnerable to having a user
added to the Administrators group.
The finder attached a program demonstrating
the issue.
(To make things more exciting, they characterized
the program as "malicious" and the person running
it as an "attacker".)
</p>
<p>
The finder didn't include source code,
but the program was small enough that it could
be reverse-compiled without too much difficulty.
The program employs the usual mechanisms for
adding a user to the Administrators group.
Nothing particularly fancy.
Just calling documented functions
in documented ways to accomplish the
documented effect.
When you run the program as a standard user,
it fails with <i>Access denied</i>,
as expected.
Only if you run it as an administrator does
it succeed in adding a user to the Administrators
group.
</p>
<p>
Which is as things should be.
</p>
<p>
There didn't appear to be anything unusual going
on here.
No security boundary was crossed.
Nothing suspicious happened.
</p>
<p>
The finder explained that this program, when run
elevated, adds a user to the Administrators group,
and no anti-malware program flagged it as suspicious.
</p>
<p>
Well yeah, because it's not suspicious.
It does something perfectly legitimate,
via perfectly legitimate means,
and it doesn't attempt to subvert any
security measures.
Indeed, this is the sort of quick little program
that you might see in a system administrator's
toolbox.
</p>
<p>
It's expected that a program which does nothing suspicious is not
flagged as suspicious.

		<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve been getting this kind of stuff more. I can tell where these people are coming from: The mobile world, where the #1 law does not apply. In Android and iOS the equivalent of such a thing would be a security vulnerability.</p>

		<p>No, it does apply, which is exactly why they spend so much effort on sandboxing. (Also, aside from the certainly of explorable bugs in any sandbox, you have to give at least SOME capabilities if you intend to have any slightly useful programs at all)</p>

		<p>I understand your point. But let&#8217;s not get sidetracked by fine distinctions; these guys report these things to me because they come from a platform where the philosophy is &#8220;an app CANNOT do with is not necessary for an app to do&#8221;. In Windows, the philosophy is &#8220;an app SHOULD NOT be granted privileges to do what is not necessary for an app to do.&#8221; Hence, a bad guy in Windows needs to persuade the end-user for privileges; in iPhone it is of no use. In Windows you need security updates and antivirus; on iPhone you only need security updates.</p>

		<p>Apps can ask for privileges even on iPhone. E.g. access your GPS, microphone, calendar. If the app asks for microphone permission and you grant it, then the app can do something bad with its privileges (e.g., spy on you whenever you use the app). In a sense the antivirus software is the App Store itself. So yes, iPhones have anti-virus software. It&#8217;s running in the cloud.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s true. I actually assumed this is something all of us have long accepted.</p>
<p>I was just merely pointing out that the computing ecosystem is changing. Scary things that once were okay are no longer okay. And the person who gets blamed for it is now a different person.</p>

		<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>That reminds me: In the mobile platform, the utility software is almost nonexistent. Almost everything is application software; hence the term &#8220;app&#8221;. But your comment is correct, regardless of this observation.</p>

		<p>If my experience with the mobile device platform is any indication, I&#8217;d say they expect one and only one official component in charge of security settings; one that is digitally signed with an exclusive certificate, tamper-proof, and invoked only by Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS.exe). Actually, I think Microsoft once proposed something similar in Next-Generation Secure Computing Base, although you probably shouldn&#8217;t trust my memory on this.</p>

		<p>*Cough* The reporter would then require that subsystem to ask the user every time whether such operation is allowed and the UI must be tamper-proof (nobody can simulate the user). Otherwise, the API could simply ask LSASS for assistance.</p>
<p>By the way, it seems that one can no longer post comments as a guest?</p>

		<p>You are making it both easy and difficult at the same time. No. None of that. I&#8217;m afraid if you already don&#8217;t know what a walled garden is, it would take me hours to explain it to you.

There is no debugging or hooking into other apps either.</p>

		<p>You&#8217;re continually switching platforms between mobile and Windows in order to try and claim everyone else is wrong about everything. Case in point: in your top-level comment, you talk about a world where LSASS.exe manages security settings (clearly this world would be Windows, as LSASS.exe is a Windows subsystem), but when someone replies to say, yeah that wouldn&#8217;t help anything due to APIs, suddenly you switch worlds to mobile and claim they&#8217;re wrong because that functionality doesn&#8217;t exist and you don&#8217;t have time to explain.</p>
<p>Please check the blog you&#8217;re on and assume people are talking about Windows.</p>

		<p>The “asking user every time” is done by the official component (LSASS), not the app, if you read carefully. Look at Windows Runtime. Every time an app wants to pin a tile to Start, Windows intercepts the request and asks the user (somehow, on behalf of the app) for permission before proceeding.</p>

		<p>You&#8217;ve officially crossed the borders of patent nonsense. So, I am un-following this conversation. Consider this a courtesy notice.</p>

		<p>I Discretionary Access Control List, that I do not have the discretion to change, is the moral equivalent of a Mandatory Access Control List (Because it&#8217;s the Owner&#8217;s discretion &#8211; and they&#8217;re not the owner).</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want users of the phone to be able to do bad things, then don&#8217;t grant them that permission.</p>

		<p>I think you have the terms backwards.  DAC allows the owner of the object to set/change permissions on the object.  MAC is controlled by the Operating System (not the owner).  With MAC, the owner of an object may not be able to set/change permissions on the object.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
