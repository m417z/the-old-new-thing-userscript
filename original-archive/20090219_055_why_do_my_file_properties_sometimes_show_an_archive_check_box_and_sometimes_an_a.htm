<p>When you view the properties of a file and go to the General page, there are some check boxes at the bottom for file attributes. There's one for <i>Read-only</i> and one for <i>Hidden</i>, and then it gets weird. Sometimes you get <i>Archive</i> and sometimes you get an <i>Advanced</i> button. What controls which one you get?</p>
<p> It depends on whether there is anything interesting in the Advanced dialog. </p>
<p> If the volume supports either compression or encryption (or both), then you will get an <i>Advanced</i> dialog with check boxes for <i>Archive</i>, <i>Compress</i> and <i>Encrypt</i>. On the other hand, if the volume supports neither compression nor encryption, then you will just get an <i>Archive</i> check box, since it looks kind of silly having an <i>Advanced</i> button that shows you a dialog box with just one check box on it. (Note that these features can also be disabled by group policy, so it's not purely a file system decision.) </p>
<p> In Windows, the most commonly encountered file system that does not support compression or encryption is probably FAT, and the most commonly encountered one that does is almost certainly NTFS, so in a rough sense, you can say that FAT gives you an <i>Archive</i> check box and NTFS gives you an <i>Advanced</i> button. </p>

		<p>As I understood it, it doesn&#8217;t mean or do anything on its own. &nbsp;It is just a flag that other programs can look at and decide what to do. &nbsp;So two files exist, one marked archive, the other not, so a backup program will only backup the one marked archive. &nbsp;But as far as I know nothing enforces that convention.</p>

		<p>The combination of A. Skrobov and xix&#8217;s answers provide the full answer: the OS sets the Archive flag when a file is written to. The backup program clears the flag on a full or incremental backup. When asked for a differential or incremental backup, the backup program simply backs up those files with the archive flag checked.</p>
<p>Say I have:</p>
<p>A.txt</p>
<p>B.txt</p>
<p>C.txt</p>
<p>A full backup is made on Monday, clearing the flags. I edit B.txt on Tuesday, and C.txt on Wednesday. A differential backup on Tuesday backs up B and leaves the archive flag set. A differential backup on Wednesday backs up B and C.</p>
<p>If I use incremental backups instead, Tuesday&#8217;s backup backs up B, and clears its flag, so an incremental backup on Wednesday only sees that C has been changed and backs it up.</p>
<p>More sophisticated backup programs might use NTFS&#8217; change journal to detect changes since a given date, as the modified timestamp of a file can be fiddled using the SetFileTime function (commonly done when mirroring files from one location to another).</p>

		<p>Hi Raymond. I have two little questions&#8230;</p>
<p>1) If the archive flag works as advertised, why isn&#8217;t it used anymore? It certainly sounds like the most reliable option: just check if the file has been written to. That doesn&#8217;t exclude having a blacklist for files you don&#8217;t want to backup, but checking if it has been written to certainly seems like a good idea, does it not?</p>
<p>2) Why does the dialog box display an Advanced&#8230; button and sufficient blank space for four checkboxes instead of four checkboxes in the most commonly encountered scenario?</p>

		<p>@Anonymous Coward: The archive flag isn&#8217;t the most reliable thing. What happens if there is more than one backup program? The first program makes a backup and clears the flag, and the second program thinks that the file already has a backup.</p>
<p>A much more reliable feature to make backups work is the &quot;Last modified&quot; timestamp.</p>

		<p>re: Users don&#8217;t want to play a text adventure game.</p>
<p>Well, like most topics in UI design, it&#8217;s a matter of opinion which approach will take them into the twisty little passages.</p>
<p>My own take on this is that I like UIs to stay the same. Thus, if some of my file system property sheets have a button labelled &#8216;advanced&#8217;, I want them all to have that. (I don&#8217;t like my twisty little passages to be all different).</p>
<p>Furthermore, if there are file system features that are generally applicable but not in this particular case, I want to see them present in the UI but tagged as inapplicable, not entirely absent.</p>
<p>The reason is that, if I don&#8217;t see something I have seen before, then my first reaction is not &#8216;oh, this filesystem does not have that feature&#8217;, but &#8216;damn, I must have forgotten where that shows up in the UI&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Button not present&#8217; does not have an easily intuitable meaning. I find it unclear whether it&#8217;s omitted for a good reason, or omitted because I&#8217;m looking in the wrong place again.</p>
<p>This is the reason, by the way, that I always disable the &#8216;personalized menus&#8217; options, which hides things I don&#8217;t much use &#8211; the very things whose location is likely to slip my memory.</p>

		<p>Like many things in DOS, the file attributes originally come from CP/M. More or less; &quot;Read-Only&quot; came across, but &quot;System&quot; got split into &quot;Hidden&quot; and &quot;System&quot;.</p>
<p>The odd thing is, there&#8217;s also an Archive attribute in CP/M, but it works the other way round; it gets set by the backup utility when the backup is made, and cleared when the file is written to.</p>

		<p>&quot;So why not just include the Compressed and Encrypted checkboxes in the properties dialog and disable the ones that aren&#8217;t supported?&quot;</p>
<p>Indeed, in NT 4, which did not have EFS or the Advanced dialog, the Compressed flag was just a checkbox on the Properties dialog.</p>

		<p>I think Slackmaster K was suggesting getting rid of the Advanced dialog/button completely.</p>
<p>i.e. Move all of the checkboxes to the main Properties sheet and only show the ones which apply to the filesystem in question.</p>
<p>There does seem to be plenty of empty space for additional checkboxes on the General tab, assuming the rest of the Advanced Attributes dialog is considered gratuitous and not carried over. (The group boxes and icon &#8220;flesh out&#8221; the Advanced dialog but don&#8217;t serve any purpose. The grouping is arbitrary and the group titles just re-state the checkbox names.)</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s still desirable to hide the &#8220;advanced&#8221; checkboxes from people by default then the Advanced button could be turned into something which shows/hides the extra checkboxes. That&#8217;s usually preferable to a child dialog and is used in some other parts of the shell, FWIW.</p>

<p>Ah, fair enough. I see that so rarely I forgot it was there.</p>
<p>Personally, then, I&#8217;d move the attributes stuff to a dedicated tab, but it&#8217;s not that important in the grand scheme of things.</p>

		<p>Some backup programs let you decide what criteria to use for backing up files. &nbsp;Those that do, as far as I have seen, always let you use the Archive flag as one of the possible criteria for backing up files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, your backup program of choice might be perfectly happy using the Archive flag for its original intended purpose.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
