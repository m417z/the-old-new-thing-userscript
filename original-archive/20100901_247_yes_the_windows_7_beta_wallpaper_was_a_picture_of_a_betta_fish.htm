<p>It wasn't long before people realized that the fish in the default wallpaper for the Windows&nbsp;7 beta was a betta fish. This was intended to be a cute little pun, though some people <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-Story-of-the-Windows-7-Beta-Fish-101857.shtml"> took the semiotics to an extreme</a>,</p>
<p> Dude, this is Windows, not <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>. It's not like the people who chose the wallpaper are using a backchannel to pass secret messages to you like "I know I'm not supposed to tell you, but here's the Windows product schedule" or "Help, I'm trapped in a wallpaper factory!" They're just having a bit of fun. </p>
<p> I have yet to see anybody point out that the fish was blowing <i>seven</i> bubbles. And no, I don't know what it "signifies". </p>
<p> (I always wonder about the people who claim that the government embeds subtle messages about their complex conspiracies in plain sight. If you want to keep a secret, <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ny2/russkafin/fcrules.html"> you don't run around talking about it</a><a>!) </a></p>

		<p>The amount of red scales and its distribution over the fish body reflect code coverage test results and their relative position in the code base.</p>
<p>The light streaming down is the reflected light off the Win7 DVD. If properly processed, you can recreate the ISO and burn your own special version of the Win7 DVD, which includes the master plan for the take-over of the world by the illuminate running the secret government from the basement of the UN.</p>

		<p>Well, this is just a standard interpretation of an artist&#39;s work.</p>
<p>And it is not even a deep analysis, there is much more to notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vastness of the ocean, it is not full, containing only a lonely fish and it bubbles. Likewise it is not a full Windows version.</li>
<li>
<p>The fish looking/swimming upwards, the version will improve, and get better. But it will be only a small change, since the fish deviates only slightly from the horizontal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its tail is hanging down, the fish is sad, perhaps because the changes are too slow for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#39;s looking up to the sun. Admiringly? A subtle lÂ´hint that .net hasn&#39;t reached java so far?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8 rays of the sun and 7 bubbles, the rays from left to right, the bubbles from right to left. The RTL support is still not as good at the LTR support?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost nothing on the right side of the image, software developer tend to use mostly the left side of their brain, and neglect the right, artist side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#8230; &#8230;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, a scholar of the arts/humanities could write BOOKS about the interpretation of such an image (and they do, just go in the next library).</p>

		<p>&quot;you don&#39;t run around talking about it!&quot;</p>
<p>But that&#39;s the trick &#8211; similar to &quot;Big Lie&quot; working better than the small one, you have to be so blatantly obvious about your nefarious plans that it would be crazy to believe you are revealing so much.</p>

		<p>What&#39;s amazing about conspiracy theories is that it overestimates the intelligence, capacity and time of the supposed conspirators. No group in the world had the manpower nor extra time to execute all these crazy conspiracies, let alone the intelligence to pull it off.</p>

		<p>@Jeff, plus consider the precarious nature of out-in-the-open secrets. Suppose a group really were trying to put the conspiracy together, with all the effort that entails, and were using public backchannels to pass information. All that hard work would go down the drain once one clever agent cracked the code. It&#39;s much more secure (and in some cases, easier) to coordinate traditional secret message passing.</p>

<p>This reminds me of the final panel of this XKCD: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://xkcd.com/370/" rel="nofollow">http://xkcd.com/370/</a></p>
<p>I used to work with someone who was into conspiracies, who explained that embedding secret messages into TV, film, the Federal Reserve System, etc. served to let people who weren&#39;t in the know disregard the theories as crazy: &quot;Dude, you&#39;ve been watching too much TV.&quot; &nbsp;It&#39;s *ALL* part of the conspiracy, man!</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
