<p> A colleague of mine stopped by my office to tell me that he got a telephone call from his father in Poland asking him <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/27/880411.aspx"> why Microsoft sunk Poland</a>. My colleague was somewhat baffled by this question, since his father isn't a computer nerd, but his father explained that he saw the story on the front page of the newspaper. Apparently, <a href="http://gospodarka.gazeta.pl/gospodarka/1,68367,3707792.html"> the story ran in the largest Polish newspaper</a>, but it doesn't appear that they credited their source, demonstrating that quality journalism is hard to find in any country. My guess is that the jump into Poland came from <a href="http://www.centrumxp.pl/aktualnosci/3204,dlaczego_microsoft_zatopi%C5%82_polsk%C4%99.aspx"> this page</a>, which does credit my article. I'm just guessing, though, since I can't read Polish. </p>
<p> I just found it weird to see my stuff spreading all the way to general-audience newspapers in Poland. </p>

		<p>gazeta.pl cites &quot;PC World Komputer&quot; (it says Źr&#243;dło: PC World Komputer) and it looks like they copied the story from that paper.</p>
<p>In the first sentence it says that the explanation for the bug came from an MSDN blog:</p>
<p>&quot;W jednym z blog&#243;w umieszczonych na witrynie Microsoft Developer Network pojawiło się&quot;</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Well the topic was really something visible to every Polish user of Windows(tm) XP(tm, rtm, &nbsp;etc). And it&#8217;s not surprising that a &quot;dead tree&quot; newspaper doesn&#8217;t print the link to the blog page.</p>
<p>They could have mentioned your name, but</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got the impression that you don&#8217;t like to be the target of bigger public interest, so did they kind of make you a favor?</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s wierd, I know. &nbsp;I still get mail from angry Swedes from the time I posted on how to fix CTRL+ENTER in IE because it had been localized to go to El Salvadorian sites in Sweden. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>So tell me, Raymond, would you say that your hobby is linguistics, or learning languages? Not specifically in reference to this post, but I know in the past you&#8217;ve indicated that you&#8217;ve studied a number of languages.</p>

		<p>Now that your previous post has come full circle, the question is how long before this post gets picked up by some newspaper, which you then quote in another post&#8230;</p>

		<p>Actually the journalist (ŁB) who wrote that piece is famous of such, err, &quot;journalism&quot;, mostly on anything Microsoft-related. Accusations, taking stuff out of context to create sensation, and most of all, not knowing much of the topic written on. If you only read any of his articles on Vista&#8230;</p>

		<p>Re. the Missing Country: one of my colleagues just gave a much better explanation (it might not be correct, but it&#8217;s funnier hence better). It&#8217;s the climate. The Poles Are Melting&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
