<p>Last year, a friend of mine who lives out of state&mdash;let's call her Lisa&mdash;wanted to pay her family in Seattle a surprise visit, and I was enlisted as an accomplice. (Specifically, my r&ocirc;le was to pick her up from the airport and take her home.) Everything was going smoothly until she made the mistake of telling one of another out-of-state relative about her plans. That relative then told a family member in Seattle, "Don't tell anybody, because it's a secret, but Lisa is making a surprise visit next week."</p>
<p> And that family member told two more family members, "Don't tell anybody, because it's a secret, but Lisa is making a surprise visit next week." </p>
<p> Soon this "secret" was known to half of the family. How do you recover from this? </p>
<p> The solution Lisa employed would not have occurred to me. When a family member who "knew" about her surprise visit called to say, "Hey, I know you're coming," she would naturally act as if nothing of the sort was in the cards. "Where did you get that crazy idea? I just took a vacation a few weeks ago, remember? What do you think the odds are that my boss is going to let me take two week-long vacations in the span of a month?" Fine, everybody would probably think to do that. </p>
<p> But then she sold the deception by calling one of the family members back a few days later. "Hey, it's Lisa. I'm at the front door. Open up, I don't have my key." With a shout of "I knew it!" the family member excitedly rushed to the front door, threw it open, and... </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.poemuseum.org/selected_works/the_raven.html"> Darkness there and nothing more</a>. </p>
<p> "Ha-ha! <a href="http://avltheatre.com/ruben/2007/09/three_bits_of_lost_middle_scho.html#SPELLING_ERROR_9%22"> Psyche</a>!" </p>
<p> Over the next few days, she repeated this prank on everybody who "knew" that she was coming to visit. In other words, she mocked her family for believing the rumor! (That, to me, was the stroke of brilliance.) </p>
<p> Upon her arrival in Seattle, I took her home, where she stood on the doorstep, took out her mobile phone, and called the house. </p>
<p> "Hey, it's Lisa. I'm at the front door. Open up, I don't have my key." </p>
<p> "Cut it out, Lisa, this isn't funny any more," was the response, followed by a click. </p>
<p> And then Lisa rang the doorbell. </p>
<p> Psyche! </p>

		<p>I have to say, that was a stroke of genius.</p>
<p>Last year, I went to visit a friend who lived quite far away for a surprise on her birthday. From the car, I sent her a text message congratulating her and apologising for not being her. 10 minutes later, her doorbell rang.</p>

		<p>@John, asdf:</p>
<p>English sucks. &nbsp;It&#8217;s spelled psyche anywhere I&#8217;ve ever seen it but always pronounced as if it rhymed with &quot;mike&quot;.</p>
<p>(<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=psyche" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=psyche</a>)</p>
<p>If it helps a word that ends in e tends to be a silent e that makes the preceding vowel sound long (i.e. psych-e -&gt; long &#8216;i&#8217; sound for the y, just as &#8216;mike&#8217; is a long-i,silent-e). &nbsp;But that is kind of bunk since no one pronounces the base &quot;psych&quot; with a short vowel sound, it&#8217;s always long-i.</p>

		<p>@Michael Pyne</p>
<p>Clearly those urbandictionary lusers can&#8217;t spell.</p>
<p>If you consult a &quot;real&quot; dictionary, you&#8217;ll find that &quot;psyche&quot; rhymes with Nike. Even the link Raymond provided gives the two-syllable pronunciation. BUT, and this is the important point, &quot;psyche&quot; does NOT mean &quot;Ha! Fooled ya!&quot;</p>

		<p>Funny stuff. &nbsp;The real kicker would have been if her family decided that she really wasn&#8217;t visiting and flew out to where she lives for a surprise visit. &nbsp;Each arriving to an empty household in the others respective home town&#8230;</p>

		<p>Surprise visits, surprise parties, are highly overrated. &nbsp;Lots of potential for embarrassment, and other mishaps.</p>

		<p>Words that are pronounced differently depending on meaning are not unknown in English. For example, &quot;I read now&quot; vs &quot;I read yesterday&quot;.</p>

		<p>Hoe verras je iemand (of een hele groep mensen) die niet meer verrast kan worden? Dat lees je hier. In het kort (en het Nederlands)&#8230; X wil een verrassingsbezoek brengen aan haar familie in Verwegland. Ze maakt echter de fout van dat tegen Y te z&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
