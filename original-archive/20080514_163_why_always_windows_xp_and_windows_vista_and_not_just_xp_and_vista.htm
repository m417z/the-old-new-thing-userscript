<p>When the Internet Explorer folks <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/08/04/688899.aspx"> announced</a> that they were going to call their next version of Internet Explorer <i>Internet Explorer&nbsp;7 for Windows&nbsp;XP</i> and <i>Internet Explorer&nbsp;7 in Windows&nbsp;Vista</i>, many people responded to the awkward name by suggesting that it be shortened to <i>Internet Explorer&nbsp;7 XP</i> and <i>Internet Explorer&nbsp;7 Vista</i>. Why the longer names?</p>
<p> Lawyers. </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/usage/windows.mspx"> Microsoft's own trademark guidelines</a>&dagger; specify that the product names are <i>Windows&nbsp;XP</i> and <i>Windows&nbsp;Vista</i> and not just <i>XP</i> and <i>Vista</i>. The trademark is on the entire phrase, not just the last word. Furthermore, the trademark guidelines specify that products may not append just <i>XP</i> or <i>Vista</i> to their names; they have to say <i>X for Windows&nbsp;XP</i> or <i>X for Windows&nbsp;Vista</i>. </p>
<p> In an earlier era, you had to be careful to say <i>Windows&nbsp;NT</i> and not just <i>NT</i> for the same reason. You see, the name <i>NT</i> is a registered trademark of Northern Telecom, and part of the agreement with "the other NT" is that the Windows product would always be used with the word <i>Windows</i> in front. </p>
<p> If you took a close look at the Windows&nbsp;2000 box, you may have seen the phrase "Built on NT Technology." I don't know how hard it was to do, but I suspect a good amount of negotiations with Northern Telecom took place to allow Microsoft to use that alternate formulation without the word <i>Windows</i> in front. Indeed, if you looked really closely at the box, you'd have found a trademark acknowledgement for Northern Telecom deep in the fine print. </p>
<p> Lawyers by training are very cautious people. After all, a new lawsuit against Microsoft gets filed approximately once every thirty seconds.&para; They're probably also responsible for all your Office# shortcuts on the Start menu being named <i>Microsoft Office This 2007</i> and <i>Microsoft Office That 2007</i> instead of <i>This 2007</i> and <i>That 2007</i>, or even (shocking!) just <i>This</i> and <i>That</i>. It's a daring move, and lawyers don't like to be daring. Nobody ever got sued for playing it safe.&dagger;&dagger; </p>
<p> <b>Nitpicker's corner</b> (guest appearance) </p>
<p> *Just burning off a footnote marker because I don't like asterisks. </p>
<p> &dagger;I myself violate some of these guidelines because I try to write like a human being and not <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/19/453614.aspx"> a robot</a>. Only robots say <i>Windows-based programs</i>.&Dagger; </p>
<p> &Dagger;That statement is not literally true. Here's a reformulation of that statement for the benefit of robots:&sect; "People who say <i>Windows-based programs</i> sound like robots." </p>
<p> &sect;That statement is also not literally true. Here's a reformulation of that statement for the benefit of people who take a robotic approach to reading: "Here's a reformulation of that statement for the benefit of people who take a robotic approach to reading:" </p>
<p> ||Burning off another footnote marker because I don't like parallel lines either. </p>
<p> &para;An exaggeration, not a statement of fact. </p>
<p> #s/Office/Microsoft&reg; Office&trade; System/** </p>
<p> **I have not researched whether that's the correct way of writing it. </p>
<p> &dagger;&dagger;Okay, maybe somebody somewhere has gotten sued for playing it safe. It was just a catchy sentence, not a statement of fact. </p>

<p>Since nobody has built a robot which simulates all of the thought processes involved in reading, I don&#8217;t think &quot;a robotic approach to reading&quot; is the correct phrase here. &nbsp;The &quot;robotic approach&quot; is undefined and ambiguous. &nbsp;A more proper phrase might be something like &quot;a pedantic approach to reading&quot;.</p>

		<p>Decades ago, while helping polish up the documentation for the software product I was working on, we got a little carried away acknowleging trademarks of other companies.</p>
<p>For example, did you know that &quot;pop-up&quot; is (was?) a trademark of Kimberly-Clark (the Kleenex company)? &nbsp;Since we had used phrases like &quot;pop-up dialog&quot; we acknowledged K-C in our list&#8211;just to be safe.</p>

		<p>Shakespeare was right: &nbsp;First thing we should do is kill all the lawyersâ€  ;-)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised you didn&#8217;t touch on the various copyright and trademark symbols, though. &nbsp;I marvel reading some of the Microsoft&#174; MSDNâ„¢ pages and Microsoft&#174; Windows&#174; XPâ„¢ user&#8217;s manuals and counting the number of times I see a Microsoft&#174; brand name followed by one or more copyright and trademark symbols. &nbsp;I can understand putting it on the first instance of a name like Microsoft&#174; Office&#174; XPâ„¢, but seriously, after the eleventy-zillionth time, I&#8217;m pretty sure the reader knows that a name like &quot;Microsoft&#174;&quot; is somebody&#8217;s property. &nbsp;It&#8217;s even worse when it&#8217;s in technical documentation, because I&#8217;ve learned that as a general ruleâ€ â€ , the number of &#174; or â„¢ or &#169; symbols is inversely proportional to the information content of the document: &nbsp;It can either be written by techies or written by lawyers, but it can&#8217;t be written by both.</p>
<p>â€  There is nothing wrong with lawyers, and my comments and my quotation of Shakespeare are in no way intended to disparage their profession or to suggest that they&#8217;re ruining the country. &nbsp;Lawyers are a noble and historic people, without whom there&#8217;d be no-one to perform the vital tasks of coffee-temperature validation and post-hospital-vehicle association.</p>
<p>â€ â€  Your results may differ. &nbsp;Mileage may vary. &nbsp;Rule void where prohibited by law.</p>

		<p>Thats what makes many things Microsoft(R) creates intensely boring. They may be brilliant and even ground-breaking sometimes, but the hideous legalese together with marketing 101 style approach to naming and promoting products permeates everything like gasoline. Everything looks like it was done by committee.</p>
<p>To this day I cringe whenever I see anything starting with .NET.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ironic that Microsoft has plenty of people &nbsp;that understand the problem:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4313772690011721857" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4313772690011721857</a></p>
<p>And its tragic that those people are appear powerless, locked within the belly of the great beast.</p>

		<p>Finally, a Nitpicker&#8217;s corner worth it&#8217;s weight!</p>
<p>And to think &#8211; before I got into computers I wanted to go into law as an occupation. &nbsp;Now that I know it&#8217;s not like they show on TV, and that it&#8217;s just highly paid nitpicking, I&#8217;m so glad I avoided that turn of events.</p>
<p>But then again, isn&#8217;t programming just another form of highly paid nitpicking? &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Not that it really matters anyway &#8211; 90% of all Windows users (give or take 100%) wouldn&#8217;t know their operating system version from a hole in the ground, and its common for people to describe their OS version as &quot;Internet Explorer&quot; and their web browser as &quot;Microsoft&quot; and their word processor as &quot;Windows&quot;.</p>
<p>Also &#8211; of course someone could trademark &quot;NT&quot; &#8211; in the same way that someone could trademark &quot;apple&quot; yet you can still buy apples in the store without paying a cent to the computer company. Trademarks can be a little tricky, but generally speaking they&#8217;re a &quot;mark&quot; used to identify who is doing &quot;trade&quot; within a specific industry. So if you use &quot;I&quot; as your mark of trade you can trademark it &#8211; but you won&#8217;t get a cent from anyone unless they attempt to use your trademark in a manner that is confusing and misleading after you register it.</p>

		<p>Why does everything have the Windows prefix these days? Instead of Microsoft Internet Explorer, it&#8217;s Windows Internet Explorer. No Outlook Express, now Windows Mail. Windows Calendar, Windows Live Messenger, &#8211; is it so they can be bundled with Windows and not be confused with rival&#8217;s products?</p>

		<p>Marc: perhaps, but a lot of this trademark stuff is also protection of trademark. &nbsp;Consider the futile chase that Portakabin are leading (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://adammacqueen.blogspot.com/2007/09/portakabin.html" rel="nofollow">http://adammacqueen.blogspot.com/2007/09/portakabin.html</a>), and other eponyms like saran wrap or escalator.</p>
<p>Losing MSN for Windows Live also helps the flagship product seem bigger than just an OS, and makes them both more able to compete online.</p>

		<p>Now if the lawyers would help make sure that all the names are consistent, that would be a big help.</p>
<p>Like the Windows Embedded line. You have Windows Embedded CE, but it&#8217;s other product is Windows XP Embedded. A few people at work then added Windows CE Embedded, and Windows Embedded XP. Arg!</p>
<p>Or the directory names. &quot;Windows CE Platform Builder&quot; and &quot;Platform Builder for Windows Mobile&quot;.</p>
<p>To find stuff almost requires permuting all the combinations&#8230; especially in documents written by many people. Least Microsoft could do is send us a nice sheet in large letters, a banner, etc with the official names so we can do it right from the get-go.</p>

		<p>@Not a gaul, @MadQ: </p>
<p>You&#8217;d have to go way past *, **, *** and even **** before you need to use an Obelix (whether measured by weight or MPQ*). Not even Raymond on a good day would burn through that many footnote markers.</p>
<p>Note that MS-DOS(R) has its own homage to Asterix. &nbsp;Ever notice that C&gt; is just an &#8216;overturned menhir&#8217;?</p>
<p>PS: Asterix is well known in Australia so may have made it to the USA also.</p>

		<p>So here I am, all drowsy in the office and I read &quot;a new lawsuit against Microsoft gets filed approximately once every thirty seconds&quot;.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Aha, also a footnote marker, which probably leads to a citation. Juicy stuff for the afternoon.</p>
<p>And then, slam bang, I get dunked in a morass of footnotes. Raymond&#8217;s nitpicker corner makes a return appearance.</p>
<p>So I start looking for the place in the text where he&#8217;s put in a *. Nowhere, turns out its and orphan (thanks Maurits).</p>
<p>Okie, on to the â€ . That sounds like a valid statement Raymond might put in the NP corner.</p>
<p>Next comes the â€¡. Scroll up to the text and strain my eyes trying to spot it. Bah, turns out the &quot;footnote&quot; is referenced by the very statement preceding it.</p>
<p>And it just gets worse. More cross referencing than a Wikipedia article!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard of spaghetti code, but this is something new. Maybe I need to write a paper entitled &quot;Footnotes considered harmful&quot; a la Dijkstra?</p>

		<p>I have to admit that phrase always irks me.</p>
<p>AFAIK, the &quot;NT&quot; of Windows NT stands for New *Technology*. &nbsp;So &quot;Built on NT Technology&quot; literally means &quot;Built on New Technology Technology&quot;.</p>

		<p>I know it&#8217;s been said already in comments above, but I really love the excessive footnotes! Quite humorous. Personally I&#8217;ve never liked dealing with trademark laws; they often seem more complicated even than copyright.</p>

		<p>&quot;The OEM version bundled with the IBM PC was called PC-DOS; as far as I know, Microsoft&#8217;s generic version was always called MS-DOS.&quot;</p>
<p>Back before DR-DOS came by, not only there were PC-DOS and MS-DOS, there were Compaq DOS, Zenith DOS, and so on, all of which was derived from MS-DOS. MS referred all of these versions as &quot;DOS&quot;. However, by the time MS-DOS 5.0 was released, DR-DOS has appeared and most of the other branded DOSes was dead, and PC-DOS diverged from MS-DOS after 5.0. Hence by then MS was always using MS-DOS.</p>

		<p>@James: I find Microsoft software and technology names quite consistent and easy to remember.</p>
<p>Similarly, version names are humanly understandable (though I would&#8217;ve swapped Windows 2000 and Windows Me).</p>
<p>This is much better than naming products with mineral/animal/people names.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see that Microsoft Office 2000 is older than Microsoft Office 2003.</p>
<p>But, I don&#8217;t know whether Debian Woody is older than Debian Sarge.</p>
<p>Giving more than one name to a product is even worst (e.g. version number + code name).</p>
<p>I want a one-to-one mapping between names and things.</p>
<p>Neither a many-to-one mapping such as Debian does nor a one-to-many mapping such as Intel Pentium IV. The latter is the worst thing in the naming field I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>In my opinion (but that&#8217;s an opinion), poor naming is mainly due to marketing, not lawyers. That&#8217;s especially true for version naming.</p>

		<p>@Mark: actually, I just checked on Wikipedia (which is the Gospel Truth of course :-)) and apparently the origins of the NT designation appear to be in dispute:</p>
<p>&quot;It is popularly believed that Dave Cutler intended the initialism &#8216;WNT&#8217; as a pun on VMS, incrementing each letter by one, similar to the apocryphal story of Arthur C. Clarke&#8217;s deriving HAL 9000&#8217;s name by decrementing each letter of IBM. While this would have suited Cutler&#8217;s sense of humor, the project&#8217;s earlier name of NT OS/2 belies this theory. Another of the original OS/2 3.0 developers, Mark Lucovsky, states that the name was taken from the Intel i860 processorâ€”code-named N10 (or &#8216;N-Ten&#8217;) â€”which served as the original target hardware.[10] Various Microsoft publications, including a 1998 question-and-answer session with Bill Gates,[11] reveal that the letters were expanded to &#8216;New Technology&#8217; for marketing purposes but no longer carry any specific meaning.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course its Wikipedia, which is only one up from TV :-)</p>
<p>And whilst I would (obviously) purchase something based on MIT technology, it would still irk me for the same reason :-)</p>
<p>James</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
