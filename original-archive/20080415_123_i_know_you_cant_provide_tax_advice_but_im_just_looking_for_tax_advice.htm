		<p>Well, that kind of things happen often. People generally just deal with it, but you, you seem to get pissed of each time.</p>
<p>Why, WWWWHHHHHHHYYYYYYYY?</p>

<p>Low tolerance for idiocy is my guess. What do you want him to say? That stupid people aren&#8217;t infuriating? Because they are. At least he&#8217;s venting here on a blog instead of in a bell tower with a sniper rifle.</p>

		<p>At the risk of going off-topic here, I&#8217;m going to guess from Raymond&#8217;s posts that his Myers-Briggs personality type is INTJ. Just the dominance of logic and critical thinking that pervades his writing. Of course, this could also be borne out from being a developer.</p>

		<p>I do not see him &#8216;venting&#8217; here &#8211; I simply see him linking to a friends blog about a rather amusing story that follows in the general manner of stories that he often talks about (for example, the &quot;Email Tip: Nostalgia is not a question&quot; post).</p>
<p>After reading the story in the blog you can see how the people failed to &quot;engaging the part of the brain responsible for logic and reason&quot; &#8212; there&#8217;s a major lack of common sense here. &nbsp;Why would anyone call a library for Tax information?</p>
<p>&#8230; awe dang&#8230; I fell for the troll bait.</p>

		<p>THis reminds me of an anecdote I had read in Readers Digest. This old lady called the local police station and asked the officer the recipe of some chicken dish. The officer was taken aback, but gave her the recipe anyway.</p>
<p>After that, he asked her why she called the police station for something like this. Her response &quot;Well, you knew the answer, didn&#8217;t you?&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
