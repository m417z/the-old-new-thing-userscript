<p>
A customer used the
<code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code> function
to monitor a directory for changes, asking for
notifications only for changes directly in the directory
being monitored
(<code>bWatchSubtree = false</code>).
But they found that the
<code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code> function
reported a change even
when they created a file in
a subdirectory,
rather than in the directory being monitored.
</p>
<p>
For example, if they asked to monitor the directory
<code>C:\dir1</code>,
and a file was created at <code>C:\dir1\dir2\file</code>,
the
<code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code> function
reported a change, even though the file was created in
a subdirectory, and the request was for a non-recursive monitor.
</p>
<p>
What gives?
</p>
<p>
We saw
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110812-00/?p=9913">
some time ago</a>
that the purpose of the
<code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code> function
is to allow you to maintain a local copy of the contents
of a directory:
The idea is that you make an initial pass over the directory with
<code>Find&shy;First&shy;File</code>/<code>Find&shy;Next&shy;File</code>,
and then you use the notifications from
the <code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code> function
to make incremental updates to your local copy.
</p>
<p>
And what happened here is that the contents of an enumeration of
the <code>C:\dir1</code> directory did in fact change.
What changed is the last-modified date on
<code>C:\dir1\dir2</code>!</p>

		<p>Two questions come to my mind:</p>
<p>&#8211; What if something changes between FindFirstFile() and the first call to ReadDirectoryChangesW()?</p>
<p>&#8211; Why is there no ReadDirectoryChangesA()?</p>

		<p>1) Ideally you should call ReadDirectoryChangesW() first, kick off an update pass manually, then have ReadDirectoryChangesW() kick off the same update pass when it&#8217;s called, ideally with some locking mechanism in place to keep it from updating the same data simultaneously (unless your code doesn&#8217;t have that particular issue).</p>
<p>2) I sincerely doubt that ReadDirectoryChanges existed back in the days of FAT.  That would&#8217;ve required the OS to implement its own polling mechanisms, which would&#8217;ve add complexity and consumed precious CPU, especially with DOS compatibility the way it was back then.  It looks like this was introduced in Windows XP/2003 (maybe earlier, 2000 timeframe?  MSDN isn&#8217;t always reliable for describing when functions were actually introduced).</p>

		<p>There is paragraphs, I can see them perfectly fine for your post.<br />
The problem seems to be that if you are logged in, your own posts don&#8217;t seem to have paragraphs.</p>

		<p>Not sure why you&#8217;re saying the OS needs to poll to detect changes on FAT volumes, because any changes to FAT volumes came from the OS itself anyway.</p>

		<p>True.  I think I meant to say &#8220;hooking&#8221; instead; I didn&#8217;t think too deeply into that particular sentence.</p>

		<p>This is a pattern you&#8217;ll see everywhere in computer science. If you&#8217;re watching incremental updates, begin subscribing BEFORE you make your base copy of whatever is being updated.</p>

		<p>I thought I read that ReadDirectoryChangesW could have spurious wakeups. Maybe not.</p>

		<p>Is there a shell equivalent of ReadDirectoryChangesW, to monitor an IShellFolder (or an IShellItem of a folder) for changes?</p>
<p>Not everything in the Shell namespace corresponds to a file system directory. For example: my phone</p>

		<p>SHChangeNotifyRegister looks relevant. It requires a PIDL though, but I suppose you can get that from SHGetIDListFromObject if you have an IShellFolder.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
