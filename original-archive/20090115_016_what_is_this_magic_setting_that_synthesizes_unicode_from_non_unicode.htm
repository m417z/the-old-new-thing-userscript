<p>Commenter dan g. wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/15/551897.aspx#552295"> how Windows can treat non-Unicode applications as Unicode via the Regional and Language Options control panel</a>, specifically the part that lets you choose the <i>Language for non-Unicode programs</i>. "Having always believed that the only way to display, say, Chinese characters correctly was to compile with _UNICODE, this facility seems all the more remarkable."</p>
<p> This setting is really not as magical as it appears. (After all, we had Chinese versions of 16-bit Windows that displayed Chinese characters just fine, and they certainly didn't use Unicode since Unicode hadn't been invented yet.) <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/"> Michael Kaplan</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/pages/279998.aspx"> went through this and many other settings in the Regional and Language Options control panel</a>, and from the chart at the top of the page, you see what Windows&nbsp;XP calls the <i>Language for Non-Unicode Programs</i> used to go by the name <i>Default System Locale</i>. The old name does a better job of describing what it actually does but does a worse job of describing what it's used <i>for</i>. </p>
<p> In Win32, three character encodings have special status. Unicode (more precisely, UTF-16) of course is what Windows uses internally. There are also <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/08/389527.aspx"> two 8-bit code pages</a>: <code>CP_ACP</code>, the so-called <i>ANSI code page</i> (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/31/144893.aspx">even though it isn't actually ANSI</a>), and the <code>CP_OEM</code> code page, the so-called <i>OEM code page</i> (even though <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/29/457483.aspx"> it isn't provided by the OEM</a>). </p>
<p> When a non-Unicode program calls a function like <code>TextOutA</code> to display a string represented in the ANSI code page, the string is converted to Unicode via the <code>CP_ACP</code> code page. The <i>Language for non-Unicode programs</i> setting controls what code page <code>CP_ACP</code> corresponds to. On U.S. systems, it's typically <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/sbcs/1252.htm"> code page 1252</a>, but you can change it via that control panel. And that's where it becomes possible to display Chinese characters without using Unicode. </p>
<p> For example, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/dbcs/950.mspx"> code page 950</a> is a double-byte code page commonly seen in countries that use traditional Chinese characters. It can represent the English alphabet of A-Z, and through the use of double-byte characters can also represent a wide array of traditional Chinese characters, such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/dbcs/950/950_B3.mspx"> this block of characters which are represented by byte sequences of the form B3 40 through B3 FE</a>. If the ANSI code page is code page 950 and you pass data formatted for that code page to, say, the <code>TextOutA</code> function, the corresponding Chinese characters will display, even though the program itself doesn't use Unicode explicitly. </p>
<p> That's why it's called the <i>Language for non-Unicode programs</i>. It specifies which character set non-Unicode data should be interpreted as. </p>

		<p>When I&#8217;ve dealt with this in the past, I couldn&#8217;t understand how the apps that used CP_ACP could ensure that the character stream they were interpreting was in the code page that they expected. If I send a .txt file to a person in China, do they just go through code pages until it seems to display correctly?</p>
<p>At least for Unicode and UTF-8 there are marks at the front of the file that disambiguate. Assuming the app put them there, and the app reading them knows to interpret rather than display them. Aw crap, now you&#8217;ve brought back the voices in my head.</p>

		<p>@Dave: Assuming you&#8217;re writing in English, if you send a text file to China it will likely be readable. &nbsp;As far as I know, every Windows code page that you can select as the default code page contains ASCII as a subset.</p>
<p>But if you receive a text file containing Chinese text you&#8217;ll have to guess what code page they used.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not sure why UTF8 isn&#8217;t as popular for Windows apps as it is on Unix type OSes and many internet protocols. &nbsp;Space efficiency for some languages is worse, but at least you can have an 8-bit encoding that can do the full range of unicode characters. &nbsp;And you don&#8217;t have to recompile old programs (in most cases), keep track of if you want sizeof(foo) or sizeof(foo)/sizeof(*foo), make Foo a macro for FooA or FooW, etc.</p>

		<p>Dave,</p>
<p>If this post brings “back the voices in my head” you really shouldn’t read Michael Kaplan’s aforementioned blog. Especially the 1300+ posts he tagged as international programming all of which may likely do this for those with your affliction.</p>
<p>Additionally you may want to view his warning (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/pages/7934999.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/pages/7934999.aspx</a> ) which regrettably doesn’t include &quot;may cause voices in your head.&quot;</p>

		<p>Anonymous:</p>
<p>Windows NT uses UTF-16 almost everywhere &#8211; kernel, file system, Win32 API, etc. Presumably, that&#8217;s because it was developed before UTF-8 was created. As a result, it is quite natural to keep your own strings in UTF-16 as well &#8211; no need to convert when calling into Win32 (or higher-level APIs like COM or .NET). That is, unless you aim your code to be portable to non-Windows systems.</p>

		<p>&quot;and the app reading them knows to interpret rather than display them&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why FEFF is used as the Unicode byte-order mark, it&#8217;s a Zero-width, Non-breaking space, meaning it occupes no space, does not affect formatting, and is invisible. So it dosn&#8217;t matter if the application &#8216;shows&#8217; it, as there is nothing to show.</p>
<p>Screws up older text-file processors though, if they depend on the first character in the file being something specific (like *NIX shell scripts)</p>

		<p>Miral: Agreed. At least I use AppLocale more often then the built-in Application Compatability tab. (They do compatability job so nice that nearly no need to tweak these settings to run old program)</p>
<p>I need to use old applications developed in old version of Delphi which is native in Simplified Chinese (GB2312), plus a few Japanese (Shift JIS) games that runs certain script engine, but as Traditional Chinese user, I need to set the default locale to Big5 in order to read / run my old files (like old homework project, fictions or so)</p>
<p>Having set Applocale option for these 3 languages in context menu is handy for me. And I also wish a switch to disable that dialog box too (Or they could add the checkbox for &quot;Not showing this in the future&quot;).</p>

		<p>This reminds me: I wish AppLocale were more integrated into the system (ie. the locale setting were just a standard property of all shortcuts). &nbsp;And that you could disable that annoying dialog box. &nbsp;(And yes, I know about the hacked version that doesn&#8217;t display the dialog box.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s admittedly not something that I need to do *often*, but every once in a while I get documents saved in ANSI format using a different codepage, or I need to run a non-Unicode program that&#8217;s expecting a different codepage (sometimes frequently). &nbsp;Neither the global you-must-reboot setting nor the AppLocale danger-danger-this-is-just-temporary shortcuts quite cut it.</p>

		<p>Anonymous:</p>
<p>UTF-8 in Windows is not widely used because it&#8217;s not available as a code page.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it can&#8217;t be made available as a code page as under Windows MB_LEN_MAX is 2. (Under most Unices, I think it&#8217;s around 6).</p>
<p>Further, you can&#8217;t change MB_LEN_MAX as that&#8217;s a breaking ABI change. Existing apps compiled with char arrays of size (MB_LEN_MAX + 1) to encode a single multibyte character into will end up scribbling on other parts of the stack, with disasterous consequences.</p>

		<p>@Miral: agreed. I think it should be a standard part of Windows, as a dropdown list in the shortcut properties tab.</p>
<p>It can&#8217;t be that hard to do. Does anyone here know how AppLocale works, internally? Then we could perhaps add a property page to shortcuts, is that possible? Or would a new shortcut format be a necessity?</p>

		<p>&quot;When a non-Unicode program calls a function like TextOutA to display a string represented in the ANSI code page, the string is converted to Unicode via the CP_ACP code page.&quot;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
