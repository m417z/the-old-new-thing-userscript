<p>A customer wanted to know how to launch Explorer's Search window with specific fixed search criteria. It turns out that there are two ways of doing this, the poor man's way and the overachiever's way.</p>
<p> The overachiever's way is actually easier to discover. You can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb266520.aspx"> use the search-ms protocol</a> to generate a command string that describes the query you want to perform and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/11/26/270710.aspx"> pass it to <code>Shell&shy;Execute</code></a>. </p>
<p> The poor man's way actually requires a little bit of out-of-the-box thinking: Open the Explorer Search window and interactively create the query you want to be able to relaunch later. Now do File, Save Search, and save the query. When you want to relaunch the query, execute the saved search. This is, after all, how end users save and re-use searches. </p>

		<p>This is totally off-topic, but I just discovered that the maximum timeout for InitiateSystemShutdown is 10 years. &nbsp;Now my question about a boot menu timeout of 128 days doesn&#39;t sound so dumb, does it?</p>

		<p>What? &nbsp;No launching Explorer and then SendKeys your way to glory? &nbsp;I thought that was the normal way to automate tasks in Windows.</p>
<p>I&#39;m disappointed.</p>

		<p>Another overachiever&#39;s way would be to reverse engineer the saved search file format and create a program that can generate searches with custom arguments.</p>

		<p>@francis &#8211; Why reverse engineer the file format when the protocol is documented?</p>
<p>Option #3: &nbsp;Do the search in Explorer, then click in the address bar and copy the address, which will be a search-ms URI :)</p>

		<p>Why does the search box provide no way to search locations by environment variables? The &quot;folderpath&quot;: filter (which isn&#39;t mentioned in the AQS syntax page) doesn&#39;t accept environment variables like %windir%, %userprofile% or %tmp%. The XP search in/look in field accepted environment variables. Sure I can type %userprofile% into the Run box and then search but that&#39;s just one folder at a time. How about helping the user so he doesn&#39;t have to type long paths?</p>

		<p>GUI GUI GUI! Too bad there&#39;s no GUI to *BUILD* the search for the poor man. That&#39;s what makes the search cumbersome to use. I refuse to remember the Advanced Query Syntax. The poor man requires referring to the AQS page that sadly isn&#39;t even in the offline documentation. That and your real time search is slow compared to XP/2000. Indexer and indexed search is awesome. Another problem: the Windows Search addin to index UNC paths hasn&#39;t been updated (laziness) to work with Windows 7 from Vista. Only the Win+F window shows more search filters (though not all) and regular Explorer windows show only &quot;Date Modified&quot; and &quot;Size&quot;. I expect a GUI to build to search in the next Windows release please and a faster real-time search.</p>

		<p>@Julian:</p>
<p>how many non-it-professionals know about %windir%?</p>
<p>I guess it&#39;s all about balancing time taken and possibility of bugs against the greatest amount of general use the feature will get.</p>

		<p>I guess I must be dim. I don&#39;t seem to have a &quot;Save Search&quot; option under my File menu. I also don&#39;t end up with anything interesting in my address bar after a search.</p>

		<p>@Drak:</p>
<p>How many non-IT-professionals know about AQS in the first place?</p>
<p>I&#39;d say we&#39;re already talking about fairly technical users if we&#39;re talking about typing AQS queries by hand (at least queries beyond trivial &quot;just type a word into the box to find that word&quot; cases where the user may not be aware AQS exists or is in use).</p>

		<p>Plus, it is a regression, is it not. It was doable in the earlier one, not in a later release. Why as a user should I care how they manage their time? Features are not *supposed* to be lost just like that in an &quot;upgrade&quot; esp when you trumpet your shiny new product is a million times better than an antiqated OS.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
