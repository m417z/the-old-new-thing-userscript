<p> <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/thearts/2003976945_symp27.html"> This review of a Seattle Symphony concert from 2007</a> mentioned that back in 1998, soloist Jon Kimura Parker inserted the theme from <i>The X-Files</i> into one of his cadenzas. Cadenzas were originally points in a concerto at which soloists could improvise and show off their technical skills, but over the years, the contents of cadenzas have become more and more rehearsed, with most composers having switched over to fully-written-out cadenzas over a hundred years ago. </p>
<p> That's why it's so exciting when an improvised cadenza reappears on the scene. All of a sudden, <i>anything can happen</i>. Reading the article reminded me of a cadenza surprise in a performance by Awadagin Pratt nearly twenty years ago. I'm fairly certain the piece was a Mozart piano concerto, and during the cadenza, Pratt slipped into a middle voice the theme from the opening movement of the Mendelssohn Scottish Symphony, which was the next piece on the program! By the time I figured out what was happening, it was over. My opportunity to burst into applause in the middle of a piece was lost. </p>

		<p>Would bursting into applause have been an appropriate/correct/socially acceptable response ? (ie I can&#8217;t tell if it would have meant you were in on the joke, or if the theatre goers would have shushed you or __ ?)_</p>

		<p>Given how much classical music is scripted these days, it&#8217;s fun when the performers manage to slip in appropriate improvisations.</p>
<p>A few years back, the San Francisco Opera had a run of in-jokes. The &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot; story is referenced in two or three operas that came before Wagner&#8217;s opera. The orchestra would regularly slip in the first four note&#8217;s of Wagner&#8217;s overture while the characters on stage were relating the old myth. It always gets a laugh out of about a third of the audience.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know about a classical concert, but if a Jazz Band is playing it is perfectly acceptable to applaud after a solo (improvised or not). &nbsp;A cadenza is basically a short improvised solo in a classical piece.</p>

		<p>Written-out cadenzas were inspired also by the need to help performers who were not very good improvisers or to rein in those who used the opportunity to showboat excessively.</p>
<p>Fun fact: many of the &quot;standard&quot; cadenzas used in Mozart piano concertos were written by Beethoven.</p>

		<p>I once went to the Proms (a big concert series in London), and the program for the first half was Grieg&#8217;s Piano Concerto in A minor, which starts with a very distinctive and majestic piano segment (beginning with an A minor chord including a pretty high A).</p>
<p>The second half was a Shostakovich piece called &#8216;Hypothetically Murdered&#8217;, which is, essentially, a comedy piece. One of the instruments was this comedically detuned bar piano, and at one point the pianist got a cadenza.</p>
<p>He was playing the cadenza, joking around on the keys, and suddenly he built up to this rather distinctive A minor chord. Which was followed, of course, by the rest of the opening of the Grieg concerto.</p>
<p>I got the joke about three seconds before everyone else, and so there was I laughing at the Proms&#8230;</p>

		<p>Jon Kimura Parker has recorded with Peter Schickele (of PDQ Bach fame)</p>

		<p>Or heck, someone&#8217;s gotta slip in the Halo (Master Chief) theme in there.</p>
<p>Though, a few classical performances are doing just that &#8211; in order to show that classical isn&#8217;t boring, and you can transition from a 21st century theme to a 19th century one and have people blown away.</p>
<p>Take the big themes (Halo, Final Fantasy, etc), and mix in the &quot;proper&quot; classical, and you can come up with amazing performances.</p>

		<p>During a long Pink Floyd instrumental, they sometimes slip in the Dr Who theme. It works perfectly.</p>

		<p>When Bloodbath played Wacken Open Air in 2008 they played the guitar solo from Entombed&#8217;s &#8216;Left Hand Path&#8217; during &#8216;Furnace Funeral&#8217;, instead of the original solo.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the same sort of thing, right?</p>

		<p>Art Tatum would do this all the time: half way through an improvisation on the theme &quot;Tea For Two&quot; he&#8217;d play the vocal melody to &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot;, or &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;&#8230; He was also another proponent of the carefully rehearsed and planned &quot;improvisation&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Someone You Know: I know about VGL, except they only do game themes.</p>
<p>There was a concert held here where they mixed the classics with the modern &#8211; the goal was to show how classical music today is not only relevant, but you could skillfully start with say the Star Wars march, and end up in a piece written centuries ago. And it would sound cohesive. Those who didn&#8217;t know (e.g., the younger set) would think it was a heck of a performance or original music.</p>
<p>And I wish I had the time to attend VGL&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
