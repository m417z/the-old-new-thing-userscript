        If you play around with resizing the window, you can get a fractional line to appear
        at the bottom of the screen. This is not normally a problem until you scroll to the
        very end of the list, say, by pressing the <code>End</code> key, at which point an
        ugly blank space appears at the bottom. This ugly blank space is particularly disturbing
        when the fractional line is very nearly an entire line, because it looks like there
        is an off-by-one bug in the code somewhere.
    </p>
<p>
        We can fix this by forcing the window size to be an exact integral multiple of the
        line height. Like adding scrollbars, there is the basic idea, followed by a lot of
        detail work to get it just right.
    </p>
<p>
        The basic idea is to enforce integrality in the window resize code. The right place
        to do this is in the <i>WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING</i> handler, which allows you to adjust
        the placement of the window before it is actually moved. This avoids flicker.
    </p>
<p>
        We'll break the bulk of the work into a helper function, which will prove useful later.
    </p>
<pre>void AdjustSizeRectangle(HWND hwnd, WPARAM wmsz, LPRECT prc)
{
    RECT rc;
    int cyClient;
    int cyAdjust;

    /* Compute the resulting client height */
    SetRectEmpty(&amp;rc);
    AdjustWindowRect(&amp;rc, GetWindowStyle(hwnd), FALSE);
    cyClient = (prc-&gt;bottom - prc-&gt;top) - (rc.bottom - rc.top);

    /* Compute the number of fractional pixels */
    cyAdjust = cyClient % g_cyLine;

    /*
     *  Remove the fractional pixels from the top or bottom.
     */
    switch (wmsz) {
    case WMSZ_TOP:
    case WMSZ_TOPLEFT:
    case WMSZ_TOPRIGHT:
        prc-&gt;top += cyAdjust;
        break;
    default:
        prc-&gt;bottom -= cyAdjust;
        break;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
        The <i>WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGNG</i> handler then check if the window size is changing,
        in which case we adjust the size rectangle to enforce integrality of the client area.
        We say that the adjustments should be taken from the bottom of the window.
    </p>
<pre>BOOL OnWindowPosChanging(HWND hwnd, LPWINDOWPOS pwp)
{
    if (!(pwp-&gt;flags &amp; SWP_NOSIZE)) {
        RECT rc = { 0, 0, pwp-&gt;cx, pwp-&gt;cy };
        AdjustSizeRectangle(hwnd, WMSZ_BOTTOM, &amp;rc);
        pwp-&gt;cy = rc.bottom;
    }
    return 0;
}

    /* Add to WndProc */
    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING, OnWindowPosChanging);
</pre>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
