<p>The <code>Get&shy;File&shy;Time</code> function will tell you <i>when</i> a file was last modified, but it won't tell you who did it. Neither will <code>Find&shy;First&shy;File</code>, <code>Get&shy;File&shy;Attributes</code>, or <code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code>, or <code>File&shy;System&shy;Watcher</code>.</p>
<p> None of these the file system functions will tell you which user modified a file because the file system doesn't keep track of which user modified a file. But there is somebody who <i>does</i> keep track: The security event log. </p>
<p> To generate an event into the security event log when a file is modified, you first need to enable auditing on the system. In the <i>Local Security Policy</i> administrative tool, go to <i>Local Policies</i>, and then double-click <i>Audit Policy</i>. (These steps haven't changed <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/300549"> since Windows&nbsp;2000</a>; the only thing is that the Administrative Tools folder <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310399"> moves around a bit</a>.) Under <i>Audit Object Access</i>, say that you want an audit raised when access is successfully granted by checking <i>Success (An audited security access attempt that succeeds)</i>. </p>
<p> Once auditing is enabled, you can then mark the files that you want to track modifications to. On the <i>Security</i> tab of each file you are interested in, go to the <i>Auditing</i> page, and select <i>Add</i> to add the user you want to audit. If you want to audit all accesses, then you can choose <i>Everyone</i>; if you are only interested in auditing a specific user or users in specific groups, you can enter the user or group. </p>
<p> After specifying whose access you want to monitor, you can select what actions should generate security events. In this case, you want to check the <i>Successful</i> box next to <i>Create files / write data</i>. This means "Generate a security event when the user requests and obtains permission to create a file (if this object is a directory) or write data (if this object is a file)." </p>
<p> If you want to monitor an entire directory, you can set the audit on the directory itself and specify that the audit should apply to objects within the directory as well. </p>
<p> After you've set up your audits, you can view the results in <i>Event Viewer</i>. </p>
<p> This technique of using auditing to track who is generating modifications also works for registry keys: Under the <i>Edit</i> menu, select <i>Permissions</i>. </p>
<p> <b>Exercise</b>: You're trying to debug a problem where a file gets deleted mysteriously, and you're not sure which program is doing it. How can you use this technique to log an event when that specific file gets deleted? </p>

		<p>Auditing will tell you who opened the file, not who modified it, so it may be misleading. It should be fine for finding out who deleted a file, though, because the last person who opened a file for delete access is almost certainly the person who deleted it.</p>

		<p>I tried this, but I&#39;m not seeing the expected events in Event Viewer. I&#39;m looking under &quot;Windows Logs/Security&quot;. I can see lots of other audit events there, but nothing related to the folder on which I set the audit entries: &quot;Everyone&quot;, &quot;Successful&quot;, &quot;Create files/write data&quot;, &quot;Create folders/append data&quot;.</p>
<p>Am I looking in the right place in Event Viewer ?</p>

		<p>I guess it&#39;s not working for me because something keeps resetting the &quot;Audit object access&quot; setting in Local Security Policy. Maybe some kind of group policy thing (it&#39;s a domain-joined machine)</p>

		<p>For the exercise question, you&#39;ll have to probably also set up service accounts. Otherwise, if a service is deleting the file, the audit entry will only indicate that &quot;Network Service&quot;, &quot;Local Service&quot; or &quot;Local System&quot; did it (not overly useful in my books.)</p>

		<p>Using this (IPSec / Event viewer) to verify who (user / program) modified (deleted / updated / created) whatever (folders / files) in order to see if you got malware (rootkit / virus / trojan / worm etc) is pretty much useless. First the amount of events is humanly impossible to handle, second if you don&#39;t audit everything for everyone you simply might miss what you hunt. Catch 22. I agree that the combination of IPSec + Event viewer is a great tool for this and covers everything but simply is too much for a mere human. I will simply put with this for 20 more years when current brain mapping power supercomputers will become desktop computers as price and run a AI OS that will have my blessing to keep bad guys away. The future is cyber-war, all around, in every room. Oh, and in 40 years, when 20 years from now supercomputers will become user accessible, we shall see the rise of Skynet :D.</p>

		<p>&quot;This technique is not for detecting malware&quot;. Should been &lt;This technique primary goal is not for detecting malware&gt; because I do use it for precisely that, but is soooo damn hard, I literally sleep like a bear in the winter after a day trying to catch a new malware that the anti-virus and all other protection programs fail to detect. When those software fail to detect a new threat the only tool you got is IPSec/Event viewer. Period. Don&#39;t get me wrong Ray, it&#39;s a very good tool, but it&#39;s most valuable piece (detecting everything, 100%, nothing gets under the radar) is also the most tiring from a human perspective. All I am asking is for a little help here from Microsoft &#8211; all those money they invested in the past years, buying RAV technology to develop it&#39;s own virus protection, deploying Genuine components and so much, just a little part of the money could be poured into making Event viewer a bit friendly from developer perspective. Let&#39;s face it, it does not need to be pretty, and is an Administrative Tool, so the average user does not need to fully understand it&#39;s capabilities, but for the rest of us, the 10% of population that get&#39;s called by friends / family, by us the ones who do use it, make it SQL friendly. The current filtering / grouping of the events is way too hard. Implement some sort of SQL in it as well, make it under some &quot;advanced use&quot; where you can type in SQL commands and have the results you want. Implement only SELECT, and it would be a huge step.</p>
<p>Yes, I know you are not in that team, but let&#39;s face it, it would be treated differently if such a request would come from you then would come from opening a ticket by an outsider like me.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
