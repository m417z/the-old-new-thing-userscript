Windows&nbsp;95 had a strange feature where, if you put focus
on the Start button and then hit
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd>
(That's Alt and the hyphen key),
you got a system menu for the Start button which let you close it,
and then the Start button vanished.

wondered why this existed</a>.
</p>
<p>
This was not a feature; it was just a bug.
The person who first wrote up the code for the Start button
accidentally turned on the <code>WS_<wbr>SYS&shy;MENU</code> style.
If you turn this style on for a child window,
Windows assigns your child window a system menu.
System menus for child windows may sound strange,
but they are actually quite normal if you are an MDI application.
And the standard hotkey for calling up the system menu of a child window
is
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
The Start button was not an MDI application, but since the
<code>WS_<wbr>SYS&shy;MENU</code> style was set, Windows treated it
like one, 
and when you pressed the hotkey, you got the system menu
which let you close the window.
(You could also move it, which was also kind of weird.)
</p>
<p>
Let's add a button with an accidental system menu to our
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
scratch program</a>:
</p>
<pre>
BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
    <font COLOR=blue>g_hwndChild = CreateWindow(
        TEXT("Button"),
        TEXT("Start"),
        WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_CLIPSIBLINGS | WS_SYSMENU |
        BS_PUSHBUTTON | BS_CENTER | BS_VCENTER,
        0, 0, 0, 0, hwnd, (HMENU)1, g_hinst, 0);</font>
    return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>
Run this program, put focus on the button, and hit
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd>.
Hey look, a child window system menu.
</p>
<p>
To fix this bug, remove the <code>WS_<wbr>SYS&shy;MENU</code> style.
That's how the Explorer folks fixed it.</p>

		<p>Aww, you should have left it there. In fact you should have added a secret key combination that let you close and move any window element.</p>
<p>It sounds like I&#39;m joking (and yes, I am), but check out this (aka Opera kill button):</p>
<p>javascript:var b=new Array();var c=1;var o=((document.onkeydown==null)||(o==2))?0:1;document.onkeydown=ck;z=document.getElementsByTagName(&#39;*&#39;);for(i=0;i&lt;z.length;i++){if(z[i].tagName.search(/(HTML|BODY)/i)==-1){z[i].onclick=function(e){t=this;if(window.event) e=window.event;if((t==e.target)||(window.event)) t.parentNode.removeChild(t);if(window.opera) e.stopPropagation();return false;};z[i].onmouseover=function(){if(!c)return;c=0;t=this;b[t]=t.style.backgroundColor;t.style.background=&#39;#FF9999&#39;;};void(z[i].onmouseout=function(){t=this;t.style.backgroundColor=b[t];c=1;});}}function ck(e){k=window.event?window.event.keyCode:e.keyCode;if((k==27)||o){o=2;document.onkeydown=null;for(i=0;i&lt;z.length;i++){if(z[i].tagName.search(/(HTML|BODY)/i)==-1){z[i].onclick=null;z[i].onmouseover=null;z[i].onmouseout=null;z[i].style.backgroundColor=b[t];}}}}if(o==1) ck(1);</p>

		<p>That makes sense! But to be honest: I always suspected a very different cause: it seemed logical at the time that the Start button was a &#39;special&#39; button in the list of buttons used for the various open windows, and that this functionality was a case where they forgot the special casing. After all, hard-coding the button at index 0 seemed to make sense! In later versions that fixed it (perhaps at the upgrade to IE4 and active desktop that brought in taskbar toolbars?) the logical conclusion was that they removed the hack and made the start button a first class citizen.</p>

		<p>@Jerk that&#39;s awesome! When I was laid off from one of my early computer jobs, I changed the &quot;Bad command or file name&quot; message in COMMAND.COM to something similar but even more confusing, then deleted some common commands. I never got to see the result of that, but I imagine it was funny.</p>

		<p>From what I&#39;ve read about Windows 8 recently, there will soon be lots of people wishing for an accidental bug/feature which does the opposite. :)</p>
<p>(i.e. A hidden way to get the Start button to re-appear.)</p>

		<p>Hmm, I don&#39;t think I ever knew that.</p>
<p>I do know there&#39;s a hidden way to shut down explorer (other than killing the process), by holding ctrl-shift and right clicking on the shutdown button in the start menu (not sure when that was introduced&#8230; Vista maybe?). That&#39;s an actual feature, though, and it does come in handy on a few rare occasions. :)</p>

		<p>It&#39;s a wee bit surprising that closing the start menu didn&#39;t crash the task bar when you dragged it around and resized it.</p>

		<p>@Anonymous Coward: It was probably just fine. If I recall correctly, the start button was always in the same place relative to the task bar&#39;s window, so explorer would never have to do anything with the window handle from outside so it never noticed.</p>

		<p>I remember there was a similar thing you could do in early Win95 versions that allowed you to Move the Start Button all over the place. Might be this very thing but choosing Move instead of Close. Sadly I don&#39;t have a Win95 box around to try it on, only Win98.</p>

		<p>Sven Groot: I don&#39;t know know long that trick has been around, but here&#39;s an undocumented way to cleanly shut down Explorer that&#39;s been around since Windows 95.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the taskbar to give it keyboard focus.</li>
<li>
<p>Press Alt+F4. The &quot;Shut Down Windows&quot; dialog box will come up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Esc (or hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift and click &quot;Cancel&quot;).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike the trick described in the article, this is an actual feature, not a bug. I believe it&#39;s intended to be used by shell-extension developers.</p>
<p>(To get Explorer back, press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to start Task Manager, then use &quot;File&quot; | &quot;New Task (Run)&quot; to start &quot;explorer&quot;.)</p>

		<p>What&#39;s surprising is that no third-party depended on this functionality and therefore made it necessary for this bug to become a feature. Were the programmers lazy in these days? ;-)</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
