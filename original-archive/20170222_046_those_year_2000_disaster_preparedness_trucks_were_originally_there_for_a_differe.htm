I mentioned some time ago the
trucks filled with computers and backup generators
parked outside Building 26
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20131231-00/?p=2213">
on the evening of
December 31, 1999</a>,
standing by to assist with operations should
a worldwide disaster strike during the change to the year 2000.
</p>
<p>
(Spoiler: Nothing major happened.)
</p>
<p>
A now-retired colleague of mine&sup1;
told me that those trucks were originally there
for a different reason.
</p>
<p>
Those trucks with generators had been parked
outside Building 26 for months before the end
of 1999.
They were originally there for reliability testing.
</p>
<p>
The reliability goals for Windows 2000 included
continuous uptime that exceeded the time between
power failures in the Redmond area.
Although the Pacific Northwest is
<a HREF="http://www.nwcouncil.org/energy/powersupply/map/">
rich in hydroelectric power</a>,&sup2;
we also suffer from a lot of power outages during
the windy autumn and winter months.
That's what happens you have a lot of tall trees, I guess.
</p>
<p>
The original plan was for the trucks to be
returned when the testing was completed in December,
but upper management decided to extend the lease through
to New Years, just in case.
</p>
<p>
A lot of critical infrastructure needed to be updated
with a stable operating system
well
before the end of 1999.
The software that runs banks and hospitals are closely-regulated,
and a high degree of continuous reliability is one of the criteria.
Customers in those industries (as is typical of most industries)
have a lot of third-party software that needs to be tested.
This software is highly specialized and won't exist in Microsoft's
application compatibility library.
</p>
<p>
Enter the trucks with computers and backup generators.
These systems were set up to replicate the necessary
computing environments and set to task running tests,
including so-called "long-haul" testing,
which keeps a system running for extended periods to
help flush out issues like
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040317-00/?p=40223">
a tiny memory leak that eventually grows to the point where the
server becomes unresponsive</a>.
</p>
<p>
My colleague notes,
"There were a lot of extra hours put in to make sure
the industry was supported for an event that would happen only once."
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
In the years leading up to his retirement,
my colleague was,
among other things,
responsible for maintaining Notepad.
He wasn't the original author
(<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20091102-00/?p=16183">the identity of whom has been lost to the mists of time</a>),
but he was the one in charge of keeping it running.
</p>
<p>
&sup2;
Although
<a HREF="http://www.opb.org/news/article/even-hydro-rich-northwest-coal-still-major-power-source/">
coal also plays a major role</a>.</p>

		<p>I think you actually solved the mystery of the Notepad author about a week after that first post &#8211; <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20091117-01/?p=15993" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20091117-01/?p=15993</a>. </p>
<p>(Wikipedia attributes the very first version to Richard Brodie but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be who you&#8217;re talking about, so perhaps there&#8217;s still some mystery.)</p>

		<p>Although the Year 2000 event was a one-off and passed without any of the predicted drama, another will occur on Tuesday, 19 January 2038 when signed 32-bit integer time will overflow. Although all major OSs will have been using 64-bit integer time for a several years there will still be plenty of embedded systems that don&#8217;t and could roll back to 13 December 1901. I wonder if this time it will go as smoothly, or if complacency will have set in. Or perhaps the number of affected systems will be vastly greater than last time, they will be less accessible, and identifying and fixing them will prove an impossible task.</p>

		<p>A lot of &#8220;cloud powered&#8221; IoT devices will fail in 2038 because they use 32-bit systems and SSL/TLS libraries. When they check certificate expiration they will fail. When they DHCP and / or get network time, they will fail.</p>
<p>Whether or not any of today&#8217;s Linux powered light bulbs are still running in 2038 is a different question. I doubt it. I don&#8217;t think the vendors will bother maintaining the domain names and web services.</p>

		<p>The problem is not the tall trees. The problem is that in the US, power lines are not usually buried as there are in many other countries, rendering falling trees harmless to the power infrastructure.<br />
Backhoes, on the other hand &#8230;</p>

		<p>Utilities generally have found buried power lines to be LESS reliable than lines on poles, not more. In fact you have to over-provision them to compensate for the fact that when they fail you have to dig up a street to repair them, which is just not something you can do many times a year. </p>
<p>Those small boxes you see on the streets in neighborhoods with underground wiring that have dire warnings about electrocution are points where they can swap around between redundant cables when one fails to quickly get service restored.</p>

		<p>Well, whatever the case, I honestly can&#8217;t even remember the last power outage here in Germany, certainly none within the last 3 years. And we do bury our cables. On the other hand electricity is at least twice as expensive as it&#8217;s in the US, so maybe it&#8217;s just a case of &#8220;you get what you pay for&#8221; ;)</p>

		<p>When an underground cable failed in our town we (and 50 or so other properties) were fed from a large diesel generator, deposited on a nearby verge, for several days before a repair could be effected.  Admittedly the temporary supply was 100% reliable, although I expect the frequency was off.</p>

		<p>Most of the power cables in the UK are underground, although the power is distributed around the country with cables on pylons. Powercuts are usually caused by one of those going down, or a fault at the substation.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t get much seismic activity, which may explain why the cables are safer underground than above.</p>

		<p>Putting power lines underground is just too expensive. It may work in some parts of the country, but where I live in Massachusetts the ground is full of rocks and ledge. There are serious estimates that it would cost a trillion dollars (yes, with a T) to bury the lines in just Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one source: <a href="http://boston.cbslocal.com/2011/10/31/patrick-1-trillion-to-bury-power-lines-underground/" rel="nofollow">http://boston.cbslocal.com/2011/10/31/patrick-1-trillion-to-bury-power-lines-underground/</a><br />
And I know I&#8217;ve heard &#8220;it would cost trillions&#8221; in person from some National Grid spokesman at some point on the issue, but I don&#8217;t have an easily citable source for that.</p>

		<p>And trimming trees that grow up near/around power lines costs far less than burying the lines.  There&#8217;s been a big push by utility companies in the Northeast U.S. to trim vegetation back from the power lines after several crippling storms came through in recent years.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
