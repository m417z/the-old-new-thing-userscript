<p>The <code>FILE_<wbr>BASIC_<wbr>INFO</wbr></wbr></code> structure contains a number of fields which record the last time a particular action occurred. Two of the fields seem to describe the same thing.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><dl>
<dt>Last&shy;Write&shy;Time  </dt>
<dl>
<dd>The time the file was last written to.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Change&shy;Time  </dt>

<p> What's the difference between writing to a file and changing it? </p>
<p> I'm told that the difference is metadata. The Last&shy;Write&shy;Time covers writes to the file's data stream (which you accomplish via the <code>Write&shy;File</code> function). On the other hand, the Change&shy;Time also includes changes to the file metadata, such as changing its file attributes (hidden, read-only, <i>etc</i>.) or renaming the file. </p>
<p> (And don't forget that <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/filecab/archive/2006/11/07/disabling-last-access-time-in-windows-vista-to-improve-ntfs-performance.aspx"> Last&shy;Access&shy;Time updates are off by default now</a>.) </p>

		<p>I&#39;m guessing ChangeTime also covers Alternate Data Streams, which are usually also considered metadata.</p>

		<p>Change Time is inherited from UNIX and if it cannot be reset like UNIX, it is a good way of asking the OS whether somebody has been tampering with the file.</p>
<p>It is normally the last time file attributes were changed, and since last write time is an attribute, &#8230;</p>
<p>Exercise for the reader: why does changing last access time not change the change time?</p>

		<p>if lastaccesstime is off by default and you have an application that reads this info what modifications to the app canneed to be changed to in order to get the last access time, other then just enabling last access time or is that the only option. &nbsp;Is there some other structurevalue that we should be reading?</p>

		<p>@tonyr: How would the OS know? If it doesn&#39;t track data, it&#39;s gone. To know when a file was accessed, you need to enable this feature, before the file is accessed.</p>

		<p>@Joshua, count the updating of LastAccessTime as a change? That&#39;s just crazy talk.</p>

		<p>@Joshua then ChangeTime would be a useless field since it would always reflect lastaccesstime when lastaccesstime updating is on.</p>
<p>Also any of these fields can be modified at will. &nbsp;There are tools to do it, plus the super determined can always boot off a Linux CD and modify the values, whether they use specialized tools or just a hex editor on the raw disk. &nbsp;No OS-level restrictions will make any difference.</p>

		<p>@Dan</p>
<p>How does the super determined but non-root remote user with a file on my file server boot it off a Linux CD or other wise do anything other than access their files how I want them to?</p>

		<p>@Dan: &quot;Any of these fields can be changed at will.&quot;</p>
<p>Actually, I discovered a while ago that an attempt to set the ChangeTime counts as a change, and immediately sets the ChangeTime to the current time. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know whether this is considered a feature or a bug. But it is a fact, at least for NTFS.</p>
<p>(Dan&#39;s other point is of course true: if you go around the file system, you can change anything.)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
