<p> But the sagging economy has taken its toll on this house. <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2004/08/16/newscolumn2.html"> They were originally asking $40 million</a>. </p>

<p> For those who aren't familiar with Seattle-area geography, Medina is the quiet little town which has the modest homes of simple people <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2001837979_gatesland16e.html"> like Bill Gates</a>. </p>

		<p>Why would a 5 bedroom house have 9 bathrooms? Assuming each bedroom has its own bathroom, and allowing for 2 half-baths, that&#8217;s still 2 bathrooms extra &#8211; or 3 if you could the two half baths as 1 bathroom.</p>

		<p>Why is it that the more expensive a house is, the more it looks like a tired 1980s generic up scale hotel?</p>
<p>$35 mio and all they can do is overdose on Marble. Sad. I hope Bill&#8217;s house is more interesting.</p>

		<p>Couple of things:</p>
<p>In the USA, a lot of people call any room with a toilet a &#8216;bathroom&#8217; &#8211; consider the restaurant case, i.e., that when someone asks for ‘the bathroom’, they wouldn’t expect the indicated room to actually contain a bath. &nbsp;So, I assuming that of the 9 bathrooms, only some will contain ‘a tub’.</p>
<p>As to Medina. &nbsp;Well, it does have charm that Mercer Island lacks, and it has a nice yacht club/harbour etc.</p>

		<p>They&#8217;re not selling because the need the 35mil$, they are selling because this house has become a bad investment and will worth half in the end of the next year.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re just unloading a bad investment.</p>

		<p>&quot;They&#8217;re not selling because the need the 35mil$&quot;</p>
<p>Nobody said they needed the $35 million. Raymond&#8217;s point was that they WERE trying to sell it for $40 million &#8212; the housing downturn has devalued their property $5 million.</p>
<p>Oh, and a property like that is never meant to be an investment&#8230; nobody &quot;invests&quot; $40 million in a single property&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Dean maybe not in a private home no, but in a commercial development, obviously. Also it is partly an investment; in showing your wealth, which is required sometimes.</p>

		<p>peetm: The US realty market calls a room with a bathtub/shower and toilet is a &quot;full bath&quot;; a room with just a toilet is a &quot;half bath&quot;. A house with 3 toilets but only 2 bathtubs would likely be listed as &quot;2 1/2 baths&quot; or &quot;2.5 baths&quot;, or even &quot;2.1 baths&quot;.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
