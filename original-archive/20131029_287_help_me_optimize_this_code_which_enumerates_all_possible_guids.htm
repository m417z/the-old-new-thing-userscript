<i>Hi, I'm looking for help optimizing this code.

</p>
<pre>
<i>class Program {
 public static void Main(string[] args)
 {
  using (var w = new System.IO.StreamWriter("all_guids.txt")) {
   for (long l1 = 0; l1 &lt;= 0xFFFFFFFFL; l1++)
   for (long l2 = 0; l2 &lt;= 0xFFFFFFFFL; l2++)

                                   l1, l2, l3, l4)));
  }
 }
}</i>
</pre>
<p>
<i>I know this code will take a really long time to run,
so any performance improvements would be appreciated.</i>
</p>
<p>Okay, wait a second.
You do realize that even if you had a 100GHz machine that
could generate a new GUID every cycle,
it will still take 2&sup1;&sup2;&#x2078; &divide; 10&sup1;&sup1; =
3 &times; 10&sup2;&#x2077; seconds or 10&sup1;&#x2079; years
to complete.
</p>
<p>
<i>Right,
that's why I was looking for help making the code run faster.</i>
</p>
<p>
Look at this way:
Suppose you could somehow get this algorithm to run a quintillion
times faster, so it finishes in under a year.
Your output file is going to be 2&sup1;&sup2;&#x2078; &times; 16 =
2&sup1;&sup3;&sup2; bytes in size.
That's around 10&sup2;&#x2077; terabytes.
One terabyte of SSD storage weighs around 100 grams.
The mass of the earth is 10&sup2;&#x2074; kilograms.
Therefore, before you run this program,
you will need to acquire 100 earth-sized planets
and convert them all to SSDs.
</p>
<p>
What are you trying to do with all of these GUIDs?
</p>
<p>
<i>There's a Web site that uses GUIDs to identify resources.
I want to enumerate all the GUIDs so I can request each one
from the Web site to see if it contains anything interesting.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Okay, so it doesn't matter how fast your GUID enumeration algorithm is,
because that's not the rate-limiting factor in this entire exercise.
The limiting factor is the speed of the Web server you are
attacking.
(And at this point, it's fair to say that
what you're doing is <i>attacking</i> a Web server.)
Even if the Web server can handle a billion hits per second,
it will take 10&sup2;&sup2; years for it to respond to all
your requests.
</p>
<p>
Looking at it another way: Suppose you could enlist the resources
of <i>every computer on the Internet</i> to send a million
requests per second.
It would still take over 10&sup1;&sup3; centuries for them
to try every GUID.
</p>
<p>
And the server administrators might suspect something is up
after, oh, about seven centuries.
</p>
<p>
This problem requires a sociological, not engineering, solution.
You need to contact the site administrators,
describe what information you would like,
and see if you can come to some sort of data-sharing agreement.
</p>
<p>
<i>I've contacted the site owners, but they are not interested
in helping me,
so I have no choice but to try every GUID.</i>
</p>
<p>
Your computer is already plenty powerful enough to generate GUIDs as fast
as the Web site can handle inbound requests.
Maybe you can upgrade your cable modem to a higher level of service.
</p>
<p>
Actually, what you need to do is upgrade the <i>other site's</i>
hardware and Internet connection to a higher level of service.
Because they are the bottleneck, not you.
"Here's a half million dollars to get faster servers.
Just a gift from me.
No really, no strings attached.
Have fun.
Just get those faster servers online right away, okay?"
</p>
<p>
I wish you good luck.</p>

		<p>1. That code needs to be rewritten in ASM. After all, &quot;everyone&quot; knows that Assembly is Faster(tm).</p>

		<p>Extremely large numbers are very surprising to the untrained. I can still remember a time before I performed some simple calculations when I thought that the number of legal chess games didn&#39;t seem too bad. There have been a few times where I started down the road to a brute force solution to various problems before performing some back of the envelope calculations showing that my solution would take years to complete.</p>
<p>If this person is really determined to attack this service (this is not advice), then perhaps they could purchase a simple subscription to the service and try to analyze the data that is going back and forth. There may be patterns to exploit; at least to narrow the search space for their attack.</p>

		<p>A first optimization would be to restrict the algrotithm to the known space of valid MAC addresses.</p>
<p>Kind of reminds me of when I bought my first 386 computer in 1991 and I wrote a QuickBasic program to try to brute force calculate prime numbers with nested for loops.</p>

		<p>To be completely fair, while GUIDs are 16 bytes and randomly generated, their generation algorithms are designed to avoid _accidental_ collisions. &nbsp;They are _not_ designed to be random enough for security purposes, i.e. they do not have 128 bits of entropy. &nbsp;By taking known guids from the victim site, it should be possible to extrapolate clusters of guids and reduce the search space. &nbsp;As Raymond said though, this is clearly an attack on the site.</p>
<p>This is why web application platforms (ASP.NET, WebLogic, Rails, etc) don&#39;t use guids as session identifiers or CSRF tokens (any more).</p>

		<p>I think the first thing to do would be to check WHICH type of GUID is used: If they are MAC address-based GUIDS, and there&#39;s only one server assigning them, the time could be divided by 2^48 and bounds could be found for the timestamp.</p>
<p>If they&#39;re random, all that can be done is removing the version bits.</p>

		<p>well I think the theoretical range of guids is too big.</p>
<p>I would try it with a more practical relevant scope.</p>
<p>Like bank account numbers. Here we haven&#39;t all possible ones in use, too.</p>
<p>The question is how a guid will be created at runtime on a windows machine for example.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve heard that microsoft uses the mac, a timestamp, the id of the cpu and so on.</p>

<p>&gt;It might be something of a gray area, but I always figured that if someone makes something publicly available, there&#39;s nothing wrong with scraping it as long as you&#39;re considerate about it (and making one billion requests per second is not very considerate).</p>
<p>If you&#39;re scraping public content by following visible links like a search engine, sure. If you&#39;re peppering the server with thousands/millions/billions of bogus requests on the off chance of stumbling on a good ID value, you&#39;re basically doing a denial of service attack.</p>

		<p>&gt;10**19 years to complete</p>
<p>Ah, but the questioner desires a result immediately. Clearly what he needs to do is to go back in time to the beginning of the universe (estimated to be 1.3&#215;10**10 years ago) with a billion (10**9) computers, then he&#39;d have an answer right about now. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>This guy clearly needs to optimize his attack. &nbsp;If you try and store all the GUIDs first and then use them against the website you end up iterating over the list *twice*! &nbsp;Much more efficient to issue a request for each GUID as you construct it as you only loop 2^128 times instead of 2^129. Much better.</p>

		<p>Lots of people seem to be commenting on the technical reasons why this is a bad idea, but few have commented on the LEGAL reason why it&#39;s a bad idea:</p>
<p>&gt; I&#39;ve contacted the site owners, but they are not interested in helping me</p>
<p>If the site owners are not interested in helping you, then brute forcing all of the GUIDs on the website to get at information you&#39;re not supposed to be able to see is against the law as per the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (USA) or equivalent in whichever country the requester is in.</p>

		<p>&quot;This reminds me of people sternly pointing out that two randomly generated Guid might still collide, suggesting that you still had to check for that case.&quot;</p>
<p>Two, perhaps not. But if you keep generating a list and checking each against each other you risk running in to the Birthday Paradox. After about a trillion or so, things start to get mathematically significant and perhaps worth spending a second to protect against. It really then depends on whether you&#39;re talking about a NASA spacecraft or a personal blog at that point. Collisions can occur, it just depends on the context.</p>
<p>Not to mention some hardware devices that don&#39;t properly initialise their RNG seed and can generate the same GUIDs by fault. You want to contract against that case regardless. You might trust the GUID specification, but that doesn&#39;t mean the implementation is sound.</p>
<p>&quot;To be completely fair, while GUIDs are 16 bytes and randomly generated, their generation algorithms are designed to avoid _accidental_ collisions. &nbsp;They are _not_ designed to be random enough for security purposes, i.e. they do not have 128 bits of entropy.&quot;</p>
<p>Depends on the nature of the GUID. Type 4 GUIDs with a solid cryptographic generator can, in practice, be used for security purposes and are a preferred default GUID type for that reason. i.e. They stop idiots who don&#39;t read the contracts of the types they use from introducing inadvertent security holes.</p>

		<p>@Matt</p>
<p>Legally, the question is actually quite tricky (at least in the U.S.). Courts are divided on the issue of whether subjective intent of the site owner (ie., telling the user that &#39;we don&#39;t want you to do this&#39;) suffices to make your attempts to gain access against their will a criminal offense, or whether a technical barrier (like asking for password) is necessary (and actually, the latter interpretation of the law seems much more reasonable).</p>
<p>Now, requiring the user to pass GUID of the resource could count as a technical barrier, but then you&#39;ve got a slippery slope problem: suppose they required only 16-bit identifier, not a GUID, and that they have thousands of resources. If you have a substantial chance of stumbling upon a resource by entering a random URL, would it still count as circumventing a barrier to access? If not, where would you draw a line? At 1% chance? At 0.1% chance? How is the user supposed to know how many resources are there, if that&#39;s what potentially determines whether he is criminally liable? If yes, how about the case when a sequential resource id is used? Or a date? Should we assume that unless the site owner fails to provide a link, you can&#39;t access the page by guessing URLs? Do you really think it would be a good rule of criminal law (or even of tort law)?</p>

<p>There is also the question of what, specifically, the exchange between the confused questioner and the site owners was. All we have is, &quot;they are not interested in helping me.&quot; It is possible that while they are not interested in _helping_, the data is otherwise open and they don&#39;t (currently) care about _hindering_. Of course that may change part way through this brute-force/&quot;accidental&quot;-DoS.</p>

		<p>Because your GUID space is so pretty big it doesn&#39;t really makes sense listing all of them. You can easily pick a GUID at random, and try to fetch resources. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s say:</p>
<p>p(n) &#8211; pbb that we have a duplicate GUID</p>
<p>p(n) = 0.0001</p>
<p>m &#8211; size of GUID space (cardinality)</p>
<p>m = 2^132</p>
<p>then a chance, that you draw the same GUID with probability 0.01 (0.0001%) start when you test:</p>
<p>n = sqrt(2^133*0.0001) ~= 10^17 &nbsp;(check Birthday Paradox problem)</p>
<p>So you can easily pick a random GUID&#39;s for a quite a long time ;-)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t try and pretend that strawmen arguments about technical limitations lets you do what you want. Your argument degenerates to a &quot;where do we draw the line on the brand of lock you must have on your front door before the thief isn&#39;t liable?&quot;. Theft is illegal even if you leave your wallet on the sidewalk, and computer hacking is illegal even if the site is peppered with vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The duty to protect information is not a defense against INTENTIONAL and MALICIOUS intrusion. It is a remedy against the site owners by the information owners.</p>
<p>Unless you&#39;re a lawyer, don&#39;t try and pretend to yourself that what you&#39;re doing is legal if it&#39;s not. It&#39;ll only end in tears.</p>
<p>As is always the case in these matters, your best bet is to assume that if what you are doing is clearly not the intent of the site owner, then refrain from doing it until you KNOW that it is legal. That way you won&#39;t get challenged and suffer the costs of getting legal advice or representation, never mind the costs of LOSING such lawsuits.</p>

<p>You&#39;re making an awful lot of assumptions here, primarily that this person is malicious and is &quot;hacking&quot; via some vulnerability in a site&#39;s security. &nbsp;For all we know the site in question is a gallery of cats. &nbsp;Each image is stored at a URL like <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.catcats.com/?cat=">http://www.catcats.com/?cat=</a>{GUID}. &nbsp;This person emailed the site owners asking for a way to download all their cat pictures and the owners said &quot;we don&#39;t have a way to do that, sorry&quot;.</p>
<p>Would you really suggest that trying a bunch of URLs to get publicly available pictures of cats violates even the spirit of the law?</p>
<p>Also, at some point site operators have to take some responsibility, especially when there&#39;s a lack of malicious intent. &nbsp;DS and Random User made some great points.</p>
<p>&gt; Theft is illegal even if you leave your wallet on the sidewalk</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t a valid comparison at all because the contents of a wallet are implicitly private, even if the wallet itself is in a public place (so this would be like a publicly accessible server with private content protected by some mechanism). &nbsp;Remove the wallet and you have a better example, because there is no longer the implied privacy. &nbsp;But even then, this is just a classic &quot;copying == stealing&quot; argument, which is specious at best.</p>

		<p>“I remember when it was unreasonable to even think about pinging every IP address on the Internet.”</p>
<p>These days, it&#39;s not so much pinging every IP address on the Internet, it&#39;s about finding out which have been assigned.</p>
<p>What do you mean, there&#39;s at most about 4 billion? We have IPv6 now!</p>

<p>&gt; Nowadays with a 10Gbps link you could do so in a few minutes.</p>
<p>You might be able to send that many IDCMP packets to your ISP, but they&#39;ll get dropped pretty quickly as the rest of the Internet doesn&#39;t want to join in your game.</p>
<p>&gt; It&#39;s even reasonable to try sending a packet to every MAC address (though it might take a few days)!</p>
<p>Only on the Lan you are connected to as MAC address isn&#39;t routed through gateways.</p>

		<p>&gt; Yes but looking (or taking a picture) of your wallet that you left in public space certainly</p>
<p>&gt; is *not* illegal and that&#39;s the much better comparison here.</p>
<p>That comparison doesn&#39;t fit either. With a wallet the value is in having procession of the wallet. While with data the value is having access to it. If the data can only be retrieved by giving the correct Guid then it&#39;s pretty easy to argue that you haven&#39;t been given access to it and are trying to get around the access controls. In the same way that trying every combination of door access code/alarm code/atm pin.</p>

		<p>Making typo&#39;s in a browsers field isn&#39;t hacking. Sending a request for each and every GUID in existence as fast as possible definitely is, if only from a DOS point of view. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if you&#39;re doing this to get data that the owner doesn&#39;t want you to have, it&#39;s probably hacking. If the owner of the data is ok with you having the data, and you&#39;re doing this in a manner which doesn&#39;t involve a Denial of Service, you&#39;re probably not.</p>
<p>Protecting your data by hiding it behind a GUID is a silly way to secure it. Getting that data by asking for all possible GUIDs is even sillier. </p>

		<p>&gt; Making typo&#39;s in a browsers field isn&#39;t hacking.</p>
<p>British courts disagree (there was a case a few years ago when somebody removed the last path component, and was then convicted of hacking &#8211; even though some browsers have built-in functionality for this).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
