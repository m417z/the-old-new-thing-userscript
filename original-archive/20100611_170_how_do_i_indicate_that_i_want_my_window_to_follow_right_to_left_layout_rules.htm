<p>There are many ways, depending on how wide a scope you want.</p>
<p> If there is one specific window that you want to follow right-to-left layout rules, then you pass the <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>LAYOUT&shy;RTL</wbr></wbr></code> extended window style when you create the window. This extended style is inherited by child windows, so once you set a top-level window to have right-to-left layout, all child windows will have it, too. To block the <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>LAYOUT&shy;RTL</wbr></wbr></code> extended style from being inherited by child windows, pass the <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>NO&shy;INHERIT&shy;LAYOUT</wbr></wbr></code> style when you create the parent window. </p>
<p> <b>Sidebar</b>: If you're calling the <code>Message&shy;Box</code> function, then you don't directly control the styles of the top-level window. But there's a weird back-channel way to specify that you want the message box dialog to have the <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>LAYOUT&shy;RTL</wbr></wbr></code> extended style: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms645505(VS.85).aspx"> Begin the <code>lpText</code> string with two U+200F characters</a>. Then again, instead of <code>Message&shy;Box</code> you should be using the <code>Task&shy;Dialog&shy;Indirect</code> function which not only lets you customize the text on the buttons, but also lets you pass the <code>TDF_<wbr>RTL_<wbr>LAYOUT</wbr></wbr></code> flag to indicate that you want the dialog to be laid out according to RTL rules. (And as an aid to porting, the <code>Task&shy;Dialog</code> and <code>Task&shy;Dialog&shy;Indirect</code> functions implicitly turn on the <code>TDF_<wbr>RTL_<wbr>LAYOUT</wbr></wbr></code> flag if they find that <code>pszContent</code> is a pointer to a string&mdash;not a <code>MAKE&shy;INT&shy;RESOURCE</code>&mdash;which begins with two U+200F characters.) <b>End sidebar</b>.&sup1; </p>
<p> If you want right-to-left layout rules to apply to all top-level windows in your process, you have two choices. You can either do it programmatically or declaratively. (Similar to how you can specify DPI-awareness either <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633543.aspx"> programmatically or declaratively</a>.) </p>
<p> The programmatic way is to call <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633543.aspx"> <code>Set&shy;Process&shy;Default&shy;Layout(LAYOUT_<wbr>RTL)</wbr></code></a> from your application. The declarative way is to  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688119.aspx#EDC"> insert two left-to-right marks (U+200E) at the beginning of the <i>File&shy;Description</i> version resource string of the executable</a>. </p>
<p> Note that the caveats which apply to changing the process DPI awareness programmatically also apply to changing the default process layout programmatically: Code which calls <code>Get&shy;Process&shy;Default&shy;Layout</code> will see the default at the time of the call, even if some code later on calls <code>Set&shy;Process&shy;Default&shy;Layout</code> to change it. </p>
<p> Note also that it really is the application's call whether its default layout is left-to-right or right-to-left. A DLL shouldn't decide on its own to change the process default layout, at least not without co&ouml;peration from that process. If you are a DLL and you want to create a specific window with right-to-left layout, you should use the <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>LAYOUT&shy;RTL</wbr></wbr></code> method so that your decision applies only to your DLL's windows. (Otherwise you're <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/11/9193695.aspx"> using a global setting to manage a local problem</a>.) </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: Why isn't the default layout specified in the manifest like DPI-awareness? Because RTL support was added in Windows&nbsp;2000, which predated application manifests by several years. If the feature were invented today, the manifest would be a much better place for declaring it. </p>
<p> <b>Update</b> </p>
<p> &sup1; Commenter SCB pointed out that there is indeed a flag to specify that you want RTL layout on your message box: <code>MB_RTLREADING</code>. If that flag exists, then why also have the U+200F back-channel? </p>
<p> Answer: So that translators can mark a string as requiring RTL treatment without having to go back and make code changes. </p>

		<p>What surprises me is that one enables RTL for the whole application by specifying LTR marks.</p>

		<p>To complete the picture:</p>
<p>Dialog resource: you can specify WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL in the .rc</p>
<p>GDI: SetLayout( hdc, LAYOUT_RTL</p>
<p>Bitmaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use SetLayout( hdc, LAYOUT_RTL | LAYOUT_BITMAPORIENTATIONPRESERVED )</li>
<li>
<p>You can use NOMIR_RORBITMAP in bitmap handling APIs (BitBlt, StretchBlt, etc.) if you don&#39;t want them affected by the GDI setting</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Image lists: ILC_MIRROR, ILC_PERITEMMIRROR (image lists)</p>
<p>When mapping coordinates you should always use MapWindowPoints, and never ScreenToClient or ClientToScreen.</p>

		<p>Maybe I just don&#39;t get it, but what if I&#39;m writing a DLL that wants to display a message box with LTR layout rules, even if the rest of the application wants RTL?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
