<p>Chris asked for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040328"> some stories about what Explorer was like in the early days</a>.</p>
<p> Well, one thing is that the original name of Explorer was <i>Cabinet</i>, continuing the folder/document metaphor by taking all your folders and documents and putting them inside a virtual <i>filing cabinet</i>. (Cabinet was viewed as an update to the Windows&nbsp;3.1 File Manager program, whose icon as we all know was a filing cabinet.) Some remnants of this old name can be found in places like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb773207.aspx"> the <code>CABINETSTATE</code> structure</a>. (Note that this old sense of Cabinet is unrelated to the CAB file format, which is also called Cabinet.) </p>
<p> In the early versions of Cabinet, shortcuts were indicated not by a little arrow overlay but by appending &gt;&gt; to the end of the name. For example, you might see an icon on the desktop called <i>My Computer&gt;&gt;</i>. </p>
<p> The first icon in each folder was a special icon that consisted of an upward-pointing arrow with the name <i>Up One Folder</i>. This was really just a leaky abstraction, exposing the <code>..</code> directory entry as if it were a real directory. </p>
<p> We saw what the original Start menu and taskbar looked like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/10/54831.aspx"> some time ago</a>, back before it was a taskbar, and also saw <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/22/54559.aspx"> the precursor to the Start menu</a>. </p>

		<p>The .. folder entry is the one I miss most. What really messes me up is having to use Backspace on Windows XP and earlier and Alt-UpArrow on Vista and later. In general I find moving up a folder in the hierarchy far more useful than going back in the history.</p>

		<p>@Steven Don</p>
<p>Even though on Vista+ the .. is really just single clicking on the previous directory name in the address bar, it is different from having a directory in the file view. With it in the file view it is easy to infer what to do, where as using the address bar means you have to play around a little and if you are too used to older versions of Explorer then it is less obvious, and that can be a bit of a problem for people who are less capable.</p>
<p>Well anyway, in before someone complains about the features taken out of explorer in the transition between XP and Vista.</p>

		<p>The problem of Vista/7 new Explorer is that you cannot navigate using only the keyboard, as I was used to do on XP. On Vista/7, it seems that the TAB key gets lost in some points, in such a way that navigating without the mouse is a pain. XP Explorer had better ergonomy.</p>

		<p>@Crescens2k Indeed, I love the clickable path in the new-style Explorer. I&#39;m not a big mouse-user though, like Rodrigo mentions, I much prefer the keyboard. It&#39;s not so much that I think either Backspace or Alt-Up is a bad choice, but the change messes me up, especially as I have to work on both XP and Vista/7 quite frequently. Muscle memory is not to be underestimated.</p>

		<p>Excellent. More stories about prototype designs. I recently had to use XP after over a year of win7. It&#39;s amazing how the little details make a huge productivity difference. I kept asking myself why didn&#39;t they think of these things sooner. It&#39;s good to know what was attempted and abandoned.</p>

		<p>A helpful keyboard shortcut: F6 cycles focus among viewing panes in many apps. &nbsp;When I&#39;m dedicated to using the keyboard, it&#39;s quite handy.</p>
<p>OTOH, I put the mouse on the left side of the keyboard so I don&#39;t have to reach over the numpad to get at it, which means it&#39;s usually faster to hit the mouse anyway.</p>

		<p>My memory is fuzzy but I think I was the one who initially named it &quot;Cabinet&quot;. I wanted to call it &quot;File Cabinet&quot; but of course this was before long filename support had been added so &quot;Cabinet&quot; seemed like a reasonable alternative. Those with better language skills than me can probably figure out why the name had to be changed.</p>

		<p>The nice thing about the &quot;up&quot; button is that it was always in the same place. It was easy to move your mouse over to it and click however many times were necessary. With the breadcrumb bar you can&#39;t know in advance where to click. And if the full path doesn&#39;t fit in the bar you don&#39;t know how many clicks you&#39;ll need and you&#39;ll have to move the mouse between clicks. It&#39;s nice to know that the &quot;up&quot; button is making a comeback in Win8.</p>

<p>Hmmm yes, a sloppy UI mistake allowing for deleting .., with catastrophic results of course.</p>
<p>I recall a similar one here, where a version of our product shipped with this brand new search for person by upcoming scheduled event. Deleting the result row did what deleting any result row did when searching for a person, delete the person. Figures somebody would think it meant delete scheduled event. Apparently the engineer who wrote it didn&#39;t think it all the way through.</p>

		<p>Even in the DOS days, I always disliked . and .. appearing in DIR listings. It just struck me as profoundly illogical for a directory to be inside itself, never mind for it to contain it&#39;s parent.</p>
<p>I understand that the filesystem might need a backlink, and that there needs to be some syntax to make it possible to CD up one level, but really, DOS was taking it too far and I&#39;m glad .. was removed from Cabinet/Explorer.</p>

		<p>@Anonymous Coward: A actually wish DOS support things like &quot;&#8230;&quot; (for &quot;parent folder or parent folder&quot;) or even crazy thing like &quot;&#8230;.&quot; like a few *nix system too, it makes batch scripting shorter then &quot;../..&quot; and is important when you have 25x character limit on line length.</p>

		<p>What&#39;s interesting about the clickable path bar in Vista is that the same behavior was present in the MS-DOS Executive. The main difference is that it&#39;s more discoverable now due to hover effects. Was this the inspiration for the feature?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
