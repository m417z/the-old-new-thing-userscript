<p>In 2009, while hosting the Webcast launch of Office Communications Server 2007 R2 (what a mouthful; no wonder they renamed it <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/lync/default.aspx"> Lync</a>), <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/archives/161088.asp"> Stephen Elop claimed that this was the first time Microsoft had launched a major product via Webcast</a>.</p>
<p> Elop's crack team of marketing researchers apparently forgot about <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/stbnewsbytes/archive/2008/11/11/microsoft-to-launch-small-business-server-2008-and-essential-business-server-2008-tomorrow-via-live-webcast.aspx"> the Webcast launch</a>, just three months earlier, of Windows Small Business Server 2008. </p>
<p> Maybe somebody can find an even earlier Webcast launch of a major Microsoft product. </p>
<p> (Perhaps Elop is claiming that Small Business Server is not a major product, but by that standard, neither is Office Communications Server, which is arguably even more of a niche product than SBS.) </p>

		<p>Yep dates in product names really lead to some interesting situations, but maybe it&#39;s only me who finds it somehow strange to read about newly released software with a 2year old date in its name. I mean I understand why they do it, but it strikes me as odd nevertheless.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s R2, not the initial release. Same thing happened with Windows Server 2008 R2 and SQL Server 2008 R2 (which both released late 2009 IIRC)</p>

		<p>Same goes for Mandriva Linux, which usually have product name 1 year earlier than the actual release date.</p>
<p>But R2 is really different kind of story&#8230; It&#39;s nice that they don&#39;t keep the old product name as part of the name, so we can know that this release won&#39;t introduce significant change in core functionality.</p>

		<p>@Jules:</p>
<p>Auto industry insider comment: what&#39;s so strange about that?</p>
<p>At least in the US it seems traditional that the model year XX is released in Q3 of the previous year. &nbsp;Anything released after January 1st becomes a MY XX.5 (eg: first Mustang)</p>

		<p>@Steve D:</p>
<p>don&#39;t know how it works in the uS, but I always laugh when a new car is released to the public in February 201x with the grand title of &#39;Car of the Year 201x&#39;. Who says there&#39;s not gonna be a better one in the whole next 10 months??</p>

		<p>Wow Raymond &#8211; you have a real knack for timing. I don&#39;t think anyone here needed to guess who Elop is (or where he&#39;s going in a few months).</p>
<p>Especially since this was probably posted nearly two years ago.</p>
<p>It seems your time machine can peek into the future, now we need to make it go into the past.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
