<p>The title is mostly okay, but the description is wrong. Thanks to the power of web scripting, I can't actually link to my talk; I can just link to the <a href="http://sessions.microsoftpdc.com/public/sessions.aspx"> main session page</a>, and then you'll have to go searching for it. (Maybe there's a direct link but I can't find it.)</p>
<p> The title <i>Windows&nbsp;7: Deep Dive - What's New with Win32's user32 and comctl32</i> is mostly okay. Except that it's not Windows&nbsp;7, because I don't talk about the future; I talk about the past. So it's really <i>Windows&nbsp;<u>Vista</u>: Deep Dive - What <u>Was</u> New with Win32's user32 and comctl32</i>. </p>
<p> The description needs work, though. I submitted an updated version just last night, but who knows if they'll approve it. The description I had in mind goes more like this: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> This talk focuses on the lowest level user interface components (user32, comctl32) that appear in almost every Windows application. You'll learn about "recent" changes and enhancements in these subsystems, plus be subjected to some philosophical musings on how foreground activation is like love. (No really, it will actually help you write better software.) </p>

		<p>That (microsoftpdc.com) has to one of the worst sites in terms of usability I have ever seen. I know, I know, there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it, Raymond, I&#8217;m just venting, and warning anyone else who uses it (maybe it is better with a browser other than FF).</p>

		<p>After three years here at Microsoft, there&#8217;s still one thing I haven&#8217;t gotten used to: &nbsp;everyone referring to the Windows API as Win32. &nbsp;I worked at many ISVs before coming to MSFT. &nbsp;At all of those places, we said &quot;WinAPI&quot; (rhymes with &quot;sappy&quot;). &nbsp;Win32 (or Win16, Win32s, etc.) was reserved for those times where you had to make a distinction between the different flavors of the Windows API. &nbsp;Now that 64-bit computing is becoming mainstream in the PC world, I&#8217;m continually surprised how entrenched the Win32 moniker has become. &nbsp;Where&#8217;s Win64?</p>

		<p>Someone mod &quot;Whatever&quot; up! :) Bleargh!</p>
<p>Particularly annoying is that your browser&#8217;s &quot;find in page&quot; can&#8217;t scroll to the bit that says &quot;chen&quot; when you search for it, due to the completely non-standard (and ugly) panel/scrollbar thing. You actually have to do manually scroll and search by eye to find the talk you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>(For those still looking, it&#8217;s about 2/3 of the way down)</p>

		<p>The sessions page is completely unusable if JavaScript isn&#8217;t enabled. I think those responsible need to learn something about progressive enhancement &#8211; or, at the very least, graceful degradation.</p>

		<p>Isn&#8217;t JavaScript the &#8216;J&#8217; in Ajax, though? The usability improvements from Ajax transformed the Web. AdBlock Plus, definitely, but I can&#8217;t imagine seriously browsing without JavaScript these days.</p>

		<p>The main problem with javascript these days is that there are a bunch of malicious scripts out there. There is one running around that uses SQL injection to embed itself into a website, which then causes the user visiting that site to get a bunch of stuff installed on their PC. What&#8217;s worse is a bunch of legit sites are infected as well. A lot of security issues are resolved by having javascript off by default (including XSS ones).</p>
<p>And extensions like NoScript make the web faster by not having the browser stall if you accidentally click on a link that forces a plugin to load. Plus all those annoying &quot;rich media ads&quot; go away too.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know who made this PDC site but why can&#8217;t they use overflow: auto instead of this freakin idiotic javascript scrollbar. Besides they could make direct linking happen with the wonderful url #anchor stuff that can be read out by javascript which could then scroll the overflow: auto (!!!) list and select the correct item&#8230;</p>

		<p>Oh, Raymond, can you push ILC_COLOR32 to be the default for imagelist flags? I&#8217;ve seen too many icons broken because of programmers uncaring about it (in Windows too), and this is certainly not the big compatibility issue (much more things were broken on Classic-&gt;XP-&gt;Vista comctl32 path).</p>

		<p>From Frank Schwad:</p>
<p>&quot;Can you honestly say you have them all enabled on your web browser?&quot;</p>
<p>How can I enable ActiveX in GNU/Linux?</p>
<p>The Web is so &quot;open&quot; that you need a Windows+IE PC to use it!</p>
<p>From Merus:</p>
<p>&quot;The usability improvements from Ajax transformed the Web.&quot;</p>
<p>Making pretty any site unusable. Making direct linking, bookmarking, multi-windows browsing, printing almost impossible, and making the browser unresponsive with 512K ADSL connections (I don&#8217;t even know what it is with a 56K).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
