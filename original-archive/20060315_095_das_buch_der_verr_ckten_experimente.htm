<p>The Annals of Improbable Research <a href="http://improbable.typepad.com/improbable_research_whats/2005/03/the_book_of_wei.html"> tipped me off</a>  to Reto Schneider's <i> <a href="http://www.verrueckte-experimente.de/"> Das Buch der verr&uuml;ckten Experimente</a></i> (<i><a href="http://www.weirdexperiments.com/">The Book of Weird Experiments</a></i> in English), a collection of descriptions of one hundred scientific experiments throughout the course of history. As you might expect from the title, the experiments are all somewhat strange, yet nevertheless fascinating.</p>
<p> For example, how do cats always manage to land on their feet? Newton's laws would say that it's impossible: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The problem is that a falling cat has nothing to push against. Each turn that it makes with its forequarters causes its hindquarters to turn in the opposite direction. A half-clockwise turn in front means a half-counterclockwise turn behind. Theoretically, the cat should land all twisted up, which obviously is not the case. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The web site includes excerpts in <a href="http://www.verrueckte-experimente.de/leseproben_d.html"> German</a> and <a href="http://www.verrueckte-experimente.de/leseproben_e.html"> English</a>, including links to videos of cold research, feathers dropped onto the surface of the moon, and of course, falling cats. </p>
<p> Despite the tease of English-language excerpts, the book itself is available only in German. Unfortunately my German is not strong enough that I'd be able to read this book with very much success. (I can only just barely read <i>Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen</i> without the aid of a dictionary.) But I'll at least add it to my list of "books I might be able to read someday". </p>

		<p>Saying that Newton&#8217;s laws state that a cat cannot twist in mid-air is surely like saying that a trampolinist cannot twist in mid-air for the same reason.</p>

		<p>A cat can right itself in mid-air using the same principle that Microsoft used to turn itself around to embrace the internet in the mid 90&#8217;s: &nbsp;exploitation of angular momentum.</p>
<p>Now, go clean out my box.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s quite easy to do:</p>
<p>1. Put back legs out, front legs in.<br />
<br />2. Rotate front.<br />
<br />3. Put front legs out, back legs in.<br />
<br />4. Rotate back.<br />
<br />5. Repeat until vertical.</p>
<p>No laws of physics are violated, since the total angular momentum never changes. In fact, there are many variations of this idea that allow an object to twist itself around in space.</p>

		<p>MattC:</p>
<p>A trampolinist uses the initial foot position to start the twisting/flipping force before he leaves the canvas. If the force isn&#8217;t near-perfect, they don&#8217;t land on their feet.</p>
<p>Trust me on this one: I&#8217;ve got a trampoline and rarely land on my feet if I put my feet over my head.</p>

		<p>Hey Jorge,<br />
<br />actually&#8230;. V = G*T (Speed = gravitational acceleration by time).<br />
<br />meaning longer the cat falls&#8230; faster it gets.<br />
<br />it&#8217;s why if you jump from a table you don&#8217;t smash yourself on the floor at 200miles/hour.<br />
<br />but if you jump form a plane you do&#8230;.</p>

		<p>Niko: but does a tree-leaf falling from a plane land at 200mph?</p>
<p>Same thing for&#8230; everything! There is a speed limit caused by air friction.<br />
<br />NOW, does a cat have enough friction to achieve what Jorge said&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, but given enough cats, I think I could answer that as well! :)</p>

		<p>Laut dem Auszug aus dem Buch hat s_tec recht. In dem Auszug steht weiterhin, da&#223; die F&#228;higkeit der Katze, sich zu drehen, nicht mit dem Luftwiderstand zusammenh&#228;ngt.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s for Raymond to practise with ;)</p>
<p>Now in English: According to the excerpt, s_tec is right. Furthermore, the excerpt claims that the cat&#8217;s ability to twist is not related to air friction.</p>

		<p>They can do it in 1 1/2 times their height. They use ear balance and sight. Shutting off either for a cat lengthens the distance needed.</p>
<p>I ran my own experiments to prove this but not to prove the senses used (the cat said &quot;please don&#8217;t poke out my eyes&quot;). I did it on a bed so no animals were harmed in my experiments.</p>
<p>There is a black cat that lives in the storm water drain at the end of Cuzco St, Sth Coogee, NSW Australia (on the ocean &#8211; very expensive). It is starving. Usually it runs back down the drain when it see&#8217;s me (at 5:30am) but last week it meowed. So I patted it but it&#8217;s bones stick out. And I couldn&#8217;t bare to see it.</p>
<p>I just want to shame the evil people that live in this street for not feeding it.</p>

		<p>Well, Einstein proved that Newton was wrong. &nbsp;Obviously Newton didn&#8217;t have a cat. &nbsp;Or maybe it&#8217;s just that cats don&#8217;t obey Newton.</p>

		<p>Friction helps. Plus, do you know it&#8217;s more likely for a cat to survive if he falls from a 6th floor than if he falls from a 4th floor?</p>
<p>The answer is pretty simple: after a while the cat will reach terminal velocity (can&#8217;t fall any faster), so it doesn&#8217;t matter if he falls from a 10th or 6th floor, result is the same, *but* the extra floors give the cat time to relax. He will assume a shape (like a parachute) that will actually slow him down.</p>
<p>Now, if only I could remember were I read this useless piece of trivia&#8230; :-)</p>

		<p>Let&#8217;s simplify the problem: haw can a (flexible) cylinder rotate around its long axis (without external force action)? First, it bends into a letter U shape. Second, now it can rotate around (bended) long axis for 180 while keeping total angular momentum zero (because the ends of U letter rotate in opposite way so the angular momentums cancel each other). Finnaly, letter U streatches bac to letter I, but rotated 180 deg around long axis. Now, where did cat learn the alphabet?</p>

		<p>DavidCandy: &nbsp;Feeding stray cats can be considered cruel. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A neighbor of mine used to put food outside her door for all the neighborhood cats. &nbsp;It encouraged all the cats in the area to gather, and mate, and fight, and mate, and howl, and mate. &nbsp;Soon there were more cats. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Much more humane to trap and neuter them. &nbsp;I assert that feeding two stray cats leads to more total &quot;hunger and suffering&quot; (a larger eventual population of hungry cats) than letting those two original stray cats die (or euthanizing them) so they don&#8217;t breed.</p>
<p>By the way, I have three neutered, well-cared-for indoor cats.</p>

		<p>In my street all cats have homes. The siamese (two of them &#8211; one was shot but lived) steal food so are scared of nearly everybody who object to paying for their food. (except in my building where they used to like me till another person started giving them chicken every day &#8211; they think I&#8217;m ok but boring) One doesn&#8217;t feed stray cats, one adopts them.<br />
<br />I see the skin n bones cat about once every two months. I carry a can of sardines with me now.</p>

		<p>In science, there&#8217;s no such thing as a proof. There&#8217;s only evidence.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no &#187;true&#171; and &#187;false&#171; either. There&#8217;s only &#187;appropriate&#171; and &#187;inappropriate&#171;.</p>
<p>For most every-day mechanics a non-technician encounters, Newton&#8217;s laws of mechanics are appropriate.</p>

		<p>Hello. I am the author of &quot;The Book of Weird Experiments&quot;. Happy to see that I could ignite a fascinating dicussion about cats Newton and Einstein. You might be interested in a research proposal I found on the web that wanted to simulate the falling cat with a two part cylinder. See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://web.mit.edu/16.62X/www/Hurdus_Ethan_621.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://web.mit.edu/16.62X/www/Hurdus_Ethan_621.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in strange animal research, there is a film about the first &quot;scientific&quot; meeting of a real dog and Aibo on my site. See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.verrueckte-experimente.de/leseproben_e.html#story_13" rel="nofollow">http://www.verrueckte-experimente.de/leseproben_e.html#story_13</a>.</p>
<p>BTW: If you know of any English or American publisher that could be interested in my book, let me know. It was a bestseller in Germany and was given the science book of the year award.</p>
<p>Reto</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
