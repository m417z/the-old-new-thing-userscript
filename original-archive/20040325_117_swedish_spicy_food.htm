<p>My friend Jonathan is acting as my host in Uppsala,  and he was responsible for preparing dinner for  a staff party at   <a href="http://www.ostgotanation.se/website/index.php">  his nation</a>.  He chose curry. The same thing he chose the last time  he was responsible for preparing dinner for a party.</p>
<p>  The last time, one of the attendees ceremonially  dumped the curry into the trash because it was  "inedible". Translation: Too spicy.  </p>
<p>  So this time he tried to tone it down.  But by the time it came to taste-test the curry,  it was already too hot.  (Not hot at all by Thai standards.  But this is Sweden we're talking about.)  </p>
<p>  But apparently this time the Swedes have become  accustomed to slightly spicier food because nobody  complained.  </p>
<p>  At this party there was a lot of singing  (from the official club song book),  banging on tables,  and lots and lots of drinking.  Beer, wine, sangria, schnapps, whatever.  Some of the students from the U.S. taught  the Swedes how to play  paddle-less  <a href="http://www.nbpl.net/rulesno.html">beer pong</a>,  which was a hit because, well, it involves drinking.  </p>
<p>  College students + alcohol + Sweden.  You do the math.  </p>

		<p>Boy does beer pong bring up memories that I hadn&#8217;t thought of for a long time.</p>

		<p>One time Thai friends took me to a Thai restaurant, and I thought the food was delicious, but they couldn&#8217;t eat it because it was too spicy.  But I was younger then; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be able to eat it that spicy any more either.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
