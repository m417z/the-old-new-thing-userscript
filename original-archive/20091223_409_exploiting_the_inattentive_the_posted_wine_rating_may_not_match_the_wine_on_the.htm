<p> The <i>Washington Post</i> did a spot check of area wine stores and found that of the "shelf talkers" signs (those things that describe the wine and tell you what score it received from <i>Wine Spectator</i> magazine) it found, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/22/AR2007122200399.html"> a quarter of them were incorrect</a>, usually by attributing a good score to the correct wine vineyard but from a different year. So when you cruise the wine store, make sure to double-check that the information placard actually matches the wine it's posted next to.</p>

		<p>I live in Thailand and have not tasted wine since I left Australia three years ago. A friend from the UK brought out two bottles last week and we are saving them for Xmas Day.</p>
<p>Right now, I don&#8217;t care what vineyard, what year or what score it may have received from Wine Spectator magazine. Cheers !!!</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t have a palate that can discern the differences between any two wines, nor the insight to really understand a review on the sign.</p>
<p>On most things, the only review I give creedence is my own. &nbsp;If I don&#8217;t like (insert whatever product here), then I know not to try that again.</p>

		<p>Isn&#8217;t rating wine just as subjective as rating food?</p>
<p>I know places where one can get certain foods that are not as salty as they would be in the country of origin. These places are marked down in the rating, but I for one enjoy less salty food, so in my book the place is marked up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all in the palate of the taster :)</p>

		<p>Who is full of more bullshit: wine connoisseurs or audiophiles?</p>
<p>Just buy a $10 wine and put it in a $100 bottle; double blind tests have shown that people enjoy the exact same wine more if they think it is more expensive. &nbsp;Also, if your guests prefer red wine just serve them some white wine with a few drops of red food coloring; they won&#8217;t notice the difference.</p>

		<p>Sure John, but the same suggestions works for e.g. pharmaceuticals. Tell people the drug they&#8217;ve been given has effect X when it really does Y, and you&#8217;ll see effects from Y muted and mild effects of X exhibited despite no drug to cause them. That&#8217;s not a hypothetical &#8211; it&#8217;s an actual research result. That&#8217;s why placebo testing is so important.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like wine, had no reason to acquire an ability to tell one from another, but I was surprised to find that even I could tell that the Chinese wine we tried was really bad (we annoyed our hosts by conducting blinded experiments while other visitors tried to enjoy the wine) and that I could tell several famous wines apart from one another without prompting from e.g. labels.</p>

		<p>Maybe the expensive bottle trick works, but the white wine thing is right out &#8211; white wine is something i avoid mostly due to the aftertaste.</p>

		<p>But how much of that is due to your perception of white wine?</p>
<p>There was a test done where a bunch of wine &quot;experts&quot; were given two wines to review &#8211; one red and one white. &nbsp;Every single one of them used terms and phrases associated with each type of wine to describe them (I am not a wine aficionado, so I don&#8217;t really know the terms used). &nbsp;After the test, it was revealed that the two wines were in fact the exact same white wine; the &quot;red&quot; wine just had a few drops of food coloring.</p>
<p>I think this kind of thing probably only affects wine snobs, though; people who pay more attention to the vineyard and year than the taste. &nbsp;The average guy probably knows what he likes and doesn&#8217;t like and would be able to tell the difference. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t drink wine, so I couldn&#8217;t tell you one way or the other.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
