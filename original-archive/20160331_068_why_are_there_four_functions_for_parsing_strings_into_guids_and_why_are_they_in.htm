Some time ago,
we discussed
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/10/15/10647906.aspx">
the differences among various functions that take a string
and produce a GUID-like thing</a>.
Let's look at that table.
</p>
<table BORDER="1" STYLE="border-collapse: collapse" CELLPADDING="4">

<tr>
<td VALIGN="baseline"><code>Uuid&shy;From&shy;String</code></td>

<td VALIGN="baseline">shell32.dll</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Why are there four such functions, and more importantly,
why are they in three different DLLs?
</p>
<p>
As you might expect, the answer comes from history.
</p>
<p>
The first two functions on the scene are the ones in the middle
of the table.
<code>IID&shy;From&shy;String</code>
and
<code>CLSID&shy;From&shy;String</code>
come from the original 32-bit OLE library.
They differ in their intended use.
The second one is for parsing strings that represent OLE objects.
It so happens that you are allowed to do this either by specifying
the raw GUID as a string, or by specifying the programmatic ID
for the class.
That's why
<code>CLSID&shy;From&shy;String</code>
does the extra work of looking in <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</code>
to convert the string to a CLSID.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, interface IDs have no such alternate notation,
so the
<code>IID&shy;From&shy;String</code> function
accepts only stringized GUIDs.
</p>
<p>
At this point in time, OLE was a monolithic DLL.
It then became apparent that the monolithic OLE DLL was
really doing several things:
It managed document linking and embedding (OLE).
As part of that work, it also had to
manage the component object model (COM).
And in the case where the components are in different
processes, it needs
to perform remote procedure calls (RPC).
</p>
<p>
The remote procedure call functionality was useful in its
own right,
so the OLE team spun it off into its own library,
and OLE would be one of many clients of the new library.
That new library was called
RPCRT4, which I'm guessing stands for
"remote procedure call runtime, fourth attempt" (?).
</p>
<p>
The remote procedure call library therefore had to have
its own parser for stringized GUIDs;
it couldn't call up into OLE because that would be a layering
violation.
(RPC is the low-level component and OLE is the high-level component.)
And besides, the components which were using the raw RPC layer
were doing so because they explicitly didn't want OLE.
Having the string parsing function in OLE would force components
to load OLE, which ruined the point of splitting RPC into its own library.
For want a string-parsing function the kingdom was lost.
</p>
<p>
The last function on the scene is
<code>GUID&shy;From&shy;String</code>.
This was written by the shell team back in the days
of
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/05/173226.aspx">
OLE Chicken</a>.
(not to be confused with
<a HREF="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/234180/chicken-ole/">
Chicken Ole</a>).
The shell needed only a limited subset of OLE in order to function.
To avoid the performance impact of loading all of OLE
(and allocating a whopping 32KB of memory),
it contained a miniature copy of OLE; just enough to let
the shell do what it needed.
And one of the things in that miniature copy of OLE was
a function to parse strings into GUIDs.</p>

		<p>I always find these posts interesting because they highlight again how restricted memory was, and the things that we used to do to save that whopping 32KB.<br />
For rpcrt4, I always thought of it as version 4, but I guess in this situation there is no difference because I don&#8217;t remember ever seeing rpcrt(1), rpcrt2 or rpcrt3.</p>

		<p>I think those previous versions were internal to OEL development and as such not visible to outside. And to help keep track of things, they put version into filename of new library.</p>

		<p>Off-topic: Is there some configuration problem with the blog software or database backend?  For some articles, when I refresh them, I sometimes get different sets of comments, or sometimes a 404 page, as if some of the backend web hosts behind the load balancer are connecting to a different database, so that the view I get depends on which backend host I hit.</p>
<p>For example, if I repeatedly refresh <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160324-00/?p=93194" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160324-00/?p=93194</a> , I get either a 404 or a post with 15 comments; and if I repeatedly refresh <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160323-00/?p=93193" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160323-00/?p=93193</a> , I get a post which *says* it has 29 comments, but half the time, only 24 comments are shown.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s similar to what I was thinking: Why weren&#8217;t they moved to an even lower level library called by both ole32 and rpcrt4? Even if there are/were compatibility reasons for keeping the method signatures in ole32, it (ole32) could just forward on to the new component.</p>

		<p>My thoughts is that because of the subtle differences, it couldn&#8217;t be a forwarded directly. The obvious thing being the one in rpcrt4 doesn&#8217;t like the braces around the uuid, but the ones in ole32 do.<br />
But that also doesn&#8217;t mean that ole32 didn&#8217;t start using the function in rpcrt4. In fact, if you look at the imports for ole32, then you should find it.<br />
21A UuidFromStringW<br />
I found that after doing a dumpbin on ole32 on my system (Windows 10 November update).<br />
To me, one possible way of implementing the ole32 functions is to lop off the braces and then call UuidFromString in rpcrt4. Of course, since CLSIDFromString also needed to do the registry lookup when someone passed in a ProgId, then it wasn&#8217;t just a call into UuidFromString.</p>

		<p>Forgot to mention, the reason why these probably didn&#8217;t move is that they were intended to only be used with COM/OLE2. You can really see that with CLSIDFromString where it also does a lookup for a ProgId, which isn&#8217;t an RPC concept. So instead of trying to use the OLE functions, they just created a more general function.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
