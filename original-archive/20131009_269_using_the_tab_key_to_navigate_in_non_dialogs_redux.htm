You want to use the TAB key to navigate through a non-dialog,
so you
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/21/55384.aspx">
call <code>Is&shy;Dialog&shy;Message</code> in your message loop</a>,
but it doesn't work!
</p>
<pre>
<i>// code in italics is wrong
MSG msg;
while (GetMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
  if (!msg.hwnd || !IsDialogMessage(msg.hwnd, &amp;msg)) {
    TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
    DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
  }
}</i>
</pre>
<p>
The problem here is that you are passing the wrong
window handle to
<code>Is&shy;Dialog&shy;Message</code>.
The first parameter to
<code>Is&shy;Dialog&shy;Message</code>
is the dialog-like window you want to be able to navigate through.
But the code above passes the window that received the message,
so you are basically telling the control to do TAB navigation
<i>within itself</i>.
And naturally, the result of that is that focus <i>stays where it is</i>,
because if you ask a button,
"Hey, could you move to your next tab stop?"
the button is going to say,
"Dude, I'm the only tab stop on my window!"
</p>
<p>
If you think about it,
passing the window the message was already going to be dispatched
to isn't very interesting.
If that was the design of the function,
then all the work of
<code>Is&shy;Dialog&shy;Message</code>
could've just been put in
<code>Def&shy;Window&shy;Proc</code>
and we wouldn't have needed a
<code>Is&shy;Dialog&shy;Message</code>
function in the first place.
</p>
<p>
And if you think about it,
passing the window the message was already going to be dispatched
to isn't very interesting.
If that was the design of the function,
then the parameter isn't necessary.
The function could just infer it directly from the
<code>MSG</code> structure you passed as the second parameter.
</p>
<p>
The fix is to pass the main window handle to
<code>Is&shy;Dialog&shy;Message</code>:
</p>
<pre>
MSG msg;
while (GetMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
  if (!msg.hwnd || !IsDialogMessage(<font COLOR=blue>hwndFrame</font>, &amp;msg)) {
    TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
    DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
<b>Reminder</b>:
As noted in the original article,
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/10/25/10362204.aspx">
you should not use the <code>WM_USER</code> or
<code>WM_USER + 1</code> messages
in your custom window</a>.</p>

		<p>Speaking of dialogs, I prefer to just open a window and create all my controls with CreateWindow, rather than use the dialog manager. Am I doing it wrong?</p>

		<p>@Azarien: &nbsp;If you do not implement normal dialog features such as tabbing and default buttons, then yes, you are doing it very wrong. &nbsp;I can&#39;t stand when I have to use a program like that.</p>

		<p>And it seems to be fashionable to ignore the tab-order, accelerators and menu keys as well.</p>
<p>Even IE10 suffers from Alt+x not opening the proper menu, but a curious mishmash-menu.</p>
<p>Sorry xpclient, stole your line.</p>

		<p>@Deduplicator: If you mean Alt+X (rather than x meaning a wildcard), that is the key combination for opening the Tools menu accessible from the &#39;gear&#39; icon at the right-hand end of the address bar, as shown in the tooltip for that icon. This is different from the Tools menu on the command bar (Alt+O) and the Tools menu on the menu bar (Alt+T).</p>
<p>The (IE7) command bar accelerators only work if the command bar is visible; however, the menu bar accelerators temporarily display the menu bar &#8211; as does pressing and releasing Alt.</p>
<p>The IE team have clearly been careful to assign the accelerators so that there isn&#39;t a clash between these three sets of UI controls. Still, it&#39;s interesting that they&#39;ve left all the old menus in, though hidden by default, rather than daring to really take them away.</p>
<p>Tested on Windows 7 with IE10 and IE11 Preview.</p>

		<p>Well, IE10 on Win7 (64Bit, German), the menu bar accelerator for Extras is Alt+X, which brings up the gear-menu instead. Looks like you say that&#39;s &quot;just&quot; defective localization. Still bad enough, and worse it is hidden from most redmonders.</p>
<p>Anway, that&#39;s still better than office reassigning all keyboard-shortcuts just for the heck of it, breaking conventions used for microsoft-eons.</p>

		<p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>I have an ole control (edit control, does not have DLGC_WANTTAB flag) in my project, and the control is added to a dialog. when I press TAB key, focus never go to this OLE control. I use spyxx to capture message, I find that the OLE control receives KILLFOCUS after I press TAB, then it receives KEYDOWN message and KILLFOCUS message, the focus is killed, I am confused with this behavior, </p>
<p>could you give some suggestion? </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Yonghui</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
