<p>
Consider the following function on an x86 system:
</p>
<pre>
void __stdcall something(char *, ...);
</pre>
<p>
The function declares itself as <code>__stdcall</code>,
which is a callee-clean convention.
But a variadic function cannot be callee-clean since the callee
does not know how many parameters were passed,
so it doesn't know how many it should clean.
</p>
<p>
The Microsoft Visual Studio C/C++ compiler resolves this conflict
by silently converting the calling convention to <code>__cdecl</code>,
which is the only supported variadic calling convention
for functions that do not take a hidden <code>this</code> parameter.
</p>
<p>
Why does this conversion take place silently rather than generating
a warning or error?
</p>
<p>
My guess is that it's to make the compiler options
<code>/Gr</code> (set default calling convention to <code>__fastcall</code>)
and
<code>/Gz</code> (set default calling convention to <code>__stdcall</code>)
less annoying.
</p>
<p>
Automatic conversion of variadic functions to <code>__cdecl</code>
means that you can just add the <code>/Gr</code> or <code>/Gz</code>
command line switch to your compiler options, and everything will
still compile and run (just with the new calling convention).
</p>
<p>
Another way of looking at this is not by thinking of the compiler
as converting variadic <code>__stdcall</code> to <code>__cdecl</code>
but rather by simply saying
"for variadic functions, <code>__stdcall</code> is caller-clean."
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
How can you determine which interpretation is what the compiler actually does?
In other words, is it the case that the compiler converts 
<code>__stdcall</code> to <code>__cdecl</code> for variadic functions,
or is it the case that the calling convention for variadic
<code>__stdcall</code> functions is caller-clean?</p>

		<p>After some testing, it appears that for variadic functions, MinGW gcc does not put the @x suffix (so the decoration is as if __cdecl was used). I guess it is the same thing with other compilers.</p>
<p>This &quot;@&lt;number of bytes of parameters&gt;&quot; suffix used by __stdcall offers some protection on calling a callee-clean function with the wrong number of parameters, which would result in stack corruption, so it makes sense for me to not use this decoration for functions which are not callee-clean (it would be messy if the callee-clean &quot;__stdcall void f(int x)&quot; and the caller-clean &quot;__stdcall void f(int x, &#8230;)&quot; had the same decorated name&#8230;)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a spec for the warning: &quot;If I explicitely (i.e. in source code) ask for a __stdcall convention, raise a warning if it can&#39;t be satisfied and is automatically changed to another convention.&quot;</p>
<p>Note that this warning would not be raised for default conventions such as /Gz. You could say Gz means set the default convention to __stdcall *where applicable*.</p>

		<p>I can imagine a calling convention with callee-cleaned variadics: just pass a hidden argument with the number of bytes to pop from the stack.</p>
<p>I wonder how callee-cleaned variadics would work on x86, though. From a quick search, it appears that the ret instruction only takes an immediate, so there is no easy way to pop a variable number of parameters and return, since the return address has to be on the stack. This is unlike for instance ARM, where the return address can be on a register, so you can manipulate the stack freely before returning. That is probably the real reason why the Win32 calling conventions do not have callee cleaned variables: too complex to implement, and would only lose performance.</p>

		<p>[Why create extra work for no reason? &#8230; -Raymond]</p>
<p>I see it the other way around: less work. A fastcall variadic function could put the required arguments in registers and push variadic arguments on the stack. So, in the case where the variadic arguments are not provided and not used, it&#39;s a plain fastcall (I know in x64 everything is cdecl).</p>

		<p>@Cesar, I&#39;ve seen implementations of Lisp compile functions that pass the number of arguments in ECX/RCX, mainly for assertion. In theory, they could clean up the stack, and I think at least one actually does.</p>

		<p>&gt; &quot;It&#39;s not a legal stdcall function, and neither would it be a legal callee-cleaned variardic function.&quot;</p>
<p>So if the function is declared separately, that declaration requires __cdecl, and perfectly valid standard C or C++ code that compiles on every other system needs Microsoft-specific additions to make it work there too?</p>
<p>&gt; &quot;By using the address where the va_list variable ends up of course.&quot;</p>
<p>Even ignoring the functions that don&#39;t need the variadic parameter values at all, what about those that use va_start and va_end, but nothing else, because they pass the va_list to a function such as vprintf?</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
