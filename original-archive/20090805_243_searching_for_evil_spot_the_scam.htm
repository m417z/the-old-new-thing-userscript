		<p>Whatever happens to plain text!?</p>
<p>Plain text, you can skim, but you can&#8217;t skim a video.</p>
<p>Plain text loads faster on slow connections.</p>
<p>Also, I have terrible hearing, so I need subtitles to follow along with a video. &nbsp;Plain text does not need subtitles.</p>

		<p>I think Miff&#8217;s annoyance was more directed to the author than you, Raymond, in which case I agree with him. There is in this case really no benefit to using video and I&#8217;m sure that if it had been a written document, we could have read it (never mind skimming) in under 20 minutes, but the video takes an hour.</p>
<p>Also, I didn&#8217;t think the YouTube version started faster, it took two seconds in both cases.</p>

		<p>I think Miff has a point, although this might not be the best example &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure I didn&#8217;t click the link, because I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the part of the point, Where I work they don&#8217;t allow streaming video, it&#8217;s all been blocked &#8211; to many people where doing it, and bandwidth was suffering. SO they did away with it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The other part is I prefer to read because I can scan over the crap and only read what I want. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I never understood pod casts, or blogs on video, or for that matter news on video over the internet. &nbsp; The only place I get my news is on the internet, for one very good reason, I can&#8217;t stand listening to newscasters and waiting for them to get to the story I want to know about.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care about their agenda, I don&#8217;t care if they want to tease a news story for an hour only to give me 2 minutes of the story at the end of the program which is always incomplete.</p>
<p>And thanks to the internet I don&#8217;t have to care about these idiotic talking heads. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t need someone to interpret the news for me. What I want is the news, on my time, when I want it, and what I want, with the ability to skip over what I don&#8217;t care about and if there isn&#8217;t enough information, I search more on the same story and fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>All this is best and only possible in print.</p>
<p>I dont&#8217; want to be entertained with the news, and there is no need to hear about Michael Jackson for an hour and a half &#8211; unless of course I really want to, but that&#8217;s not news that&#8217;s entertainment. The news part is maybe a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m alone, or in the minority, but I like my information in print so I can read what I want, re-read it if I want, and skim if I want, and without wearing headphones or subjecting people to what I want to listen to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>okay, I&#8217;m done ranting</p>
<p>thanks : )</p>

		<p>Well&#8230; In this particular case, as far as I can tell, 070814-searching.pdf is much less interesting. Raymond was (of course) right &#8212; for this material watching actually brings more.</p>

		<p>The PDF is good for viewing the bad websites themselves ;-)</p>

		<p>Best line: &quot;You setup a bank. &nbsp;Which is easy nowadays, a bank is just a Perl script.&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
