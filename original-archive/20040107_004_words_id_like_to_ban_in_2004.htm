<p>It seems to be fashionable to do a "top words" list this time of year. We have <a href="http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html">Google 2003 Zeitgeist</a>, <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/top2003">Top Yahoo! Searches 2003</a>, <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/03words.htm">Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year for 2003</a>, <a href="http://www.yourdictionary.com/about/topten2003.html">YourDictionary.com's Top Ten Words of 2003</a>, <a href="http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2004.php"> Lake Superior State University's Banished Words List for 2004</a>; still waiting for the <a href="http://www.americandialect.org/woty.html">American Dialect Society's choice for Word of the Year for 2003</a>. </p>
<p> I like <a href="http://www.lssu.edu/">LSSU</a>'s approach, so here's my list of words I'd like to ban. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Best-of-Breed</dt>
<dd>
<p> Thank goodness this has faded, but there are still some citations out there. Please don't use it to describe my work. It makes me sound like a dog in a show. (No offense to dogs in shows!) </p>
</dd>
<dt>Leading</dt>
<dd>
<p> Everybody is "the leading this" or "the leading that". Here's my rule: If you say you're the leading XYZ or (even dodgier) "among the leading XYZs", then have to list at least three companies that are <em>not</em> leaders in the XYZ market. Because if nobody is following you, then you're not really "leading", now, are you. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p> And the word I most would like to banish from the English language: </p>
<dl>
<dt>Ask (as a noun)</dt>
<dd>
<p> This has taken over Microsoft-speak in the past year or so and it drives me batty.  "What are our key asks here?", you might hear in a meeting.  Language tip: The thing you are asking for is called a "request". Plus, of course, the thing that is an "ask" is usually more of a "demand" or "requirement". But those are such unfriendly words, aren't they? Why not use a warm, fuzzy word like "ask" to take the edge off? </p>
<p> Answer: Because it's not a word. </p>
<p> I have yet to find any dictionary which sanctions this usage. Indeed, the only definition for "ask" as a noun is <a href="http://www.bootlegbooks.com/Reference/Webster/data/89.html"> A water newt [Scot. &amp; North of Eng.]</a>, and that was from 1913! </p>
<p> Answer 2: Because it's passive-aggressive. </p>
<p> These "asks" are really "demands". So don't guilt-trip me with "Oh, you didn't meet our ask. We had to cut half our features. But that's okay. We'll just suffer quietly, you go do your thing, don't mind us." </p>
</dd>
</dl>

		<p>I&#8217;ve never been exposed to the &quot;ask&quot; as a noun, but I&#8217;ll certainly agree with you right there!</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine a more irritating use of language than that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking that I&#8217;d actually be tempted to give a lesson in english if someone attempted to use that in a conversation with me :)</p>

		<p>As an British English speaker, one of my pet peeves is the use of &quot;leverage&quot; as a verb. Its a noun &#8211; the force you apply with a lever. There is a perfectly good verb &quot;to lever&quot; which covers the managementspeak usage perfectly well.</p>

		<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>
<p>The one that get&#8217;s me is: incent, which is apparently some wacko derivation of incentive.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re doing such and such in order to &quot;incent&quot; out staff to do such and such.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve even heard incentavize.</p>
<p>People with MBA should not be allowed to coin words or phrases!</p>

		<p>I agree about &quot;ask&quot;. &quot;Ask&quot; is ofen promoted as a term to use in negotiations because it shows more respect than terms like &quot;demands&quot;, such as &quot;what are your demands?&quot; A better term to use is &quot;interest&quot;, because that&#8217;s what people should really be negotiating towards. asking someone &quot;what are your interests?&quot; has less of a zero-sum connotation and helps move towards a mutually beneficial agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;Leverage&quot; has become a verb based on its usage as a financial term describing using borrowed money to generate money. The idea is that you have existing assets (that don&#8217;t belong to you) that help you support a new venture. Unfortunately, most people (myself included) use it to describe any scenario where you use an asset, regardless of ownership, to promote something else.</p>

		<p>I agree with the sentiment, but keep in mind that most modern dictionaries are descriptive rather than prescriptive &#8211; i.e, they are attempting to describe the language as it is used rather than tell people what is correct usage.</p>
<p>So, 1) looking to (most) dictionaries for correct usage isn&#8217;t really sound, and 2) if people keep using &quot;ask&quot; as a noun, it will end up in those dictionaries sooner or later&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;Drill down&quot; is quite a horrible term as well. What happened to &quot;in-depth&quot;? And if it has to be a verb, how about using &quot;focus&quot;?</p>
<p>Instead of people concentrating and focusing, there&#8217;s a lot of drilling down going on.</p>

		<p>I hate how the word &quot;estimate&quot; is used in development. When your boss asks for an estimate on how long it&#8217;ll take to do feature X, he doesn&#8217;t want an estimate, he wants a commitment to a specific amount of time.</p>

		<p>Right on! I wanted to barf the first time I heard someone use &quot;best of breed&quot;, and it&#8217;s just gotten worse from there.</p>
<p>What is it about MBA&#8217;s/management consultants that makes them feel like they have to invent words for age-old concepts anyway? I suspect they think it makes them sound more &quot;on the ball,&quot; though to me it just makes them sound like drones incapable of an original thought.</p>
<p>By the way, I&#8217;m actually surprised that this stuff has infiltrated even Microsoft; I&#8217;d have expected Msft to be pretty resistant to this sort of stuff.<br /></p>

		<p>I think my key ask when I read this was, &quot;Is this a best-of-leading blog?&quot; The answer, of course, was &quot;yes&quot;. Raymond continues to leverage countless years of experience, with .Text providing the infostructure, to provide a more robust, and scaleable blog. </p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;ve actually heard infostructure before. </p>
<p>We used to play at a game a failed startup. We had a client and a VP that used buzzwords exclusively. So we occasionally made up some just to see if we could get them to use them in a meeting or in a document. If they did, the winner got his/her first drink paid for when we went out. &quot;factualize&quot; was a nice one. &quot;We need to factualize our design goals.&quot; We caught them using &quot;redenormalize&quot; once too. I don&#8217;t remember how one guy used &quot;readylate&quot; but I remember the president of the company using it in a stockholders meeting.</p>

		<p>R,</p>
<p>You can verb any noun. The only problem I have when someone tries to replace a perfectly good word with a new one. I think there was a discussion on this blog about replacing good German words with bad English ones. This is a similar case where good English words are replaced by bad English ones.</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s Winston Smith when we need him?</p>

<p>What irritates me in respect to language is how everyone calls a directory a folder and a file a document, and half the people say they “run” things when in fact they “open” them (with the default associated application (should I say “program”?)).</p>

		<p>I really hate the way everything is &quot;designed&quot;. For example: &quot;This software is designed to detect security incursions.&quot; or &quot;This dietary supplement is designed to burn fat while introducing only a few genetic anomalies&quot;.</p>

		<p>Hey Raymond, what do you think of &quot;process&quot; as a verb?  Fifty years ago, there was no such verb.  Today we process everything from bits to cheese and think nothing of it.  The ability to, uh, redenormalize word categories is one of the strengths that has kept English a vibrant and evolving language.</p>
<p>But while we&#8217;re at it, people who can&#8217;t use the phrase &quot;beg the question&quot; correctly drive me nuts.  People, &quot;beg the question&quot; means to advance a spurious argument which does not actually explain anything.  It does not mean to demand that a question must be asked.  eg, &quot;Christie Brinkley photographs so well because&#8230; she&#8217;s photogenic!&quot; begs the question.<br /></p>

		<p>I hate &quot;win&quot; as a noun, which appears to be another heavily used bit of doublespeak at Microsoft conferences and with salespeople through the industry, as in:</p>
<p>&quot;Separating UI interface from implementation is one of Avalon&#8217;s big wins.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Takeaway&quot; is also a pseudo-noun that bothers me, as in, &quot;These are the takeaways you should get from this presentation.&quot;</p>

<p>Unlike most folks, though, I don&#8217;t have a lot of pet peeves. It&#8217;s all English to me, and may the best word win. :-)<br /></p>

		<p>Getting a bit petty, but &quot;takeaway&quot; is a perfectly acceptable noun in British English. We use it with reference to food (mostly Chinese and Indian) where you would use &quot;take-out&quot; in the US.</p>

		<p>So, when I first came to Microsoft I couldn&#8217;t understand why (or how!) people started EVERY SINGLE e-mail / spoken comment with &quot;So&#8230; &quot;</p>
<p>I vowed it would be a trap I would never fall into, but that worked out about as well as, like, not saying &quot;like&quot; all the time.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re just &quot;filler&quot; words, but wow was it an eye-opener (or ear-opener) when I first got here.</p>
<p>I dislike the use of &quot;MSFT&quot; instead of &quot;Microsoft&quot; &#8212; even &quot;M$&quot; is better than &quot;MSFT&quot; &#8212; and one thing I *have* resisted is calling people by their e-mail alias instead of their real name. That&#8217;s just too impersonal for me.<br /></p>

		<p>MSFT is OK &#8212; it&#8217;s the Reuters symbol for Microsoft stock.</p>
<p>I always thought MS looked naff: not bad, just lazy. M$ is only used by 14-year-olds who just installed Linux on their Win98 box.</p>

		<p>Let add my scorn to INCENT&#8217;s heap. It just incenses me. I always thought &quot;motivate&quot; worked better anyway; &quot;incent&quot; probably happened because somebody was too lazy to figure out a verb that corresponds to the noun &quot;incentive&quot;. </p>
<p>Besides, &quot;motivate&quot; and &quot;incite&quot; and &quot;stimulate&quot; all have the advantage of being actual words. &quot;Incent&quot; is an erroneous back-formation, based on the assumption that the &quot;-ive&quot; at the end of &quot;incentive&quot; is a verb-to-noun conversion suffix &#8212; when actually, it is just part of the Latin root, &quot;incentivum&quot;.</p>
<p>I love the &quot;Verbing weirds language&quot; comic strip:</p>
<p>  Calvin: I like to verb words.<br />
<br />  Hobbes: What?</p>
<p>  Calvin: I take nouns and adjectives and use them as verbs. Remember when &#8216;access&#8217; was a thing? Now it&#8217;s something we do. It got verbed. Verbing weirds language.</p>
<p>  Hobbes: Maybe we can eventually make language a complete impediment to understanding.</p>

		<p>Not to get too introverted, but how about the noun &quot;blog?&quot; I hate that word.</p>
<p>Or even worse, blog as a verb. &quot;Oh, I just did a little bit of blogging yesterday. Blogged here and there.&quot;</p>

		<p>My native languages is not English, but I am pretty sure &quot;OCRing&quot; is a bad invention. But since it is used in a manual writen by a technical writer, not a marketing &quot;drone&quot;, I may be wronig. Or not?<br /></p>

		<p>My vote goes to ROBUST &#8212; incessantly parroted, mindless and sinister. Exhibit A:  the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, which sounds like the fantasy of a hormone-savaged 13-year-old. Laughable, or might be. But heaven help us, the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator is real.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
