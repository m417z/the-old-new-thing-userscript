<p>
If you use Explorer to copy a file,
and then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>
to undo the copy,
and you had file deletion confirmation enabled,
then Windows 7 would display a confirmation dialog
to verify that you really want to delete the file.
But Windows 8 no longer shows that confirmation dialog.
A customer wanted to know why.
</p>
<p>
Overwhelming customer feedback
indicated that
even though it technically meant deleting a file,
the confirmation dialog when
undoing a copy was unnecessary.
Undo operations in most programs do not prompt in general,
not even if the Undo is potentially destructive
(such as undoing a Paste operation).
All you're doing in this case
is deleting a copy of a file;
the original is still there,
so there's no data loss.
And if you forgot where the original was,
you can get the copy back by Redoing the operation.</p>

		<p>Does Explorer at least check if the original is *really* still there before deleting without confirmation? Because it&#8217;s totally possible that the original file(s) have, in fact, been removed by some other means, e.g. another program running in the background, or someone simply removed the media from which the file(s) have been copied. Of course, you could argue &#8220;well, the user pressed Ctrl+Z, so (s)he obviously didn&#8217;t want the file(s) at their target location&#8221;, but still, it&#8217;s a scenario of potential data loss.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not sure about this one.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t undoing a copy be destructive if the source of the copy is deleted/removed? This will also cause the re-do to fail.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure I have managed to lose a file like this.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, why would you use Explorer for anything other than very simple and basic tasks?</p>
<p>Doing a 4 hour copy with Explorer is just laughable. You can&#8217;t be serious.</p>

		<p>My experience is if you copy something else to the clipboard, it will interrupt a long-running (e.g. 4 hour remote DB) copy and paste operation. So there&#8217;s one reason not to use copy and paste in Explorer for a long-running copy.</p>

		<p>And what makes Explorer not &#8220;an actual tool&#8221;? It&#8217;s Window&#8217;s standard file management program, used in this case to manage files.<br />
So why not use it? And you cannot claimit doesn&#8217;t work since it did copy, after all.</p>
<p>Therefore: I, too, want a confirmation dialog, or at least the option to have one &#8212; what&#8217;s one more checkbox in Explorer&#8217;s options? &#8212; for such a destructive operation that might cost very much time and nerves.</p>

		<p>And it&#8217;s misleading too. The file hasn&#8217;t changed at all, only it&#8217;s associated name, jeez !<br />
Also, I don&#8217;t remove/change extensions that often, but when I do I&#8217;d like not to be interrupted by a useless confirmation.</p>

		<p>As Raymond has pointed out, with more options you get more complexity.  A checkbox to disable this feature would require testing, translation into other languages, etc.</p>
<p>However, this is one area where I wish the OS would have a check box.</p>

		<p>If you consider &#8220;usable&#8221; as &#8220;having an associated program with which to open it&#8221;, then indeed you don&#8217;t get this warning if you are making an unusable file usable. It&#8217;s not Windows&#8217; fault that it doesn&#8217;t understand the contents of your file well enough to know what the extension *should* be; it can only tell whether it has a program to send it to or not.</p>

		<p>Redo only works if you don&#8217;t do anything else first. If you Undo an operation, don&#8217;t realize your mistake right away, and carry out some other operation before you realize you undid the wrong thing, then you&#8217;re in trouble &#8211; Redo is only an available option if the last thing you did was an Undo or Redo.</p>

		<p>CTRL+Z to Undo the accidental Copy change and CTRL+Y to Redo the Copy change in Explorer will work provided you did not do anything else in between the time period of the File Copy process completion locally.</p>
<p>But does it work for file copied to a Network Drive or Network Shared Folder or DFS NameSpace Folder?</p>

		<p>Interestingly this also seems to apply to MOVING a file (or rather, UNDOing a file movement).</p>
<p>In the case of a copy the &#8220;no data loss has occurred&#8221; argument applies (but only to the original file).  In the case of a non-undoable MOVE, there is also no data loss, but in this case because the undo can&#8217;t be done.  But there is nothing to TELL you that it can&#8217;t/couldn&#8217;t be undone.</p>
<p>i.e.</p>
<p>&#8220;Undo a copy&#8221; &#8211; no confirmation or completion message = It worked (and if it didn&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t really matter.  you thought you were going to remove 1 copy of the file but you still have 2 copies.  No biggie).</p>
<p>&#8220;Undo a move&#8221; &#8211; no confirmation or completion message = It worked (but if it didn&#8217;t then your 1 and only copy of the file isn&#8217;t where you likely think it is).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely an edge case but edge cases can be the ones that cause the greatest headaches because the subtleties can be lost in the frustration of the confusion arising at the time.  The real answer here would be a user visible/accessible non-intrusive notification/log for completed operations combined with intrusive notifications in the event of failure.</p>

		<p>Oh geez.  Scrap that.  A failed MOVE operation (involving an unplugged USB drive in my test case) DID result in an error.  But it was **BEHIND** ALL my other windows on my desktop.  As a result, I only just found that error notification after having moved on to other work for the day and stumbling across that error message from all that time ago, lurking behind my open apps.</p>
<p>Although that&#8217;s not much better than NO notification at all, imho.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
