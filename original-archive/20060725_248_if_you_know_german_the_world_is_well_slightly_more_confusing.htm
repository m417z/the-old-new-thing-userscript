<p> When I saw the headline that <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article1185332.ece"> the head of BetonSports was arrested</a>, I thought to myself, "Who the heck would have a web site devoted to sports in concrete?" That's because the German word <a href="http://www.dict.cc/?s=deutsch-englisch:Beton"> <i lang="de">Beton</i></a> means "concrete" (the construction material) in English, and the German word <i lang="de">Sport</i> means the same as in English. </p>
<p> It took me a few moments to realize that the company's name is "Bet on Sports". </p>

		<p>Well, in German there is no &quot;sports&quot; but just &quot;Sport&quot;. So by that little S at the end of sports, you could tell it&#8217;s English. However, please also keep in mind that English is somehow derived from German.</p>

		<p>There is great confusion with pronouns in Hebrew as compared to Russian and English. The Hebrew &quot;Me&quot; means &quot;who&quot;, &quot;Who&quot; means &quot;he&quot;, &quot;He&quot; means &quot;she&quot;. In addition &quot;Ani&quot; means &quot;I&quot; in hebrew, but means &quot;They&quot; in Russian. Of course, I am transliterating. The spellings are different in some of these cases.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

<p>Modern English and Modern German are more cousins than the former derived from the latter. &nbsp;They are both members of the Germanic language family, although English has been much more influenced by French and Latin (as a consequence of the Norman conquest) than German. &nbsp;Old English, the language spoken by the Anglo-Saxons, was much closer to Old High German than the modern forms are today. &nbsp;As someone who has studied Modern German, Old English, and Latin, I find the whole matter of linguistic history fascinating in a satisfyingly geeky way.

		<p>Well, being a native Pole is not a piece of cake either. You can buy a hot dog in Poland and it&#8217;s always a &quot;hot dog&quot; here. Dog in Polish is &quot;pies&quot;. It&#8217;s pretty confusing to see &quot;hot pies&quot; outside Poland only to discover that this is a &quot;hot pie&quot; in plural.</p>

		<p>Two weeks ago, I read some teens filled soccor balls with concrete (cement?) and publically challenged people to kick them. A few people were hurt and the kids were arrested.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember which contry that was in, but I wasn&#8217;t all that surprised to read Raymond&#8217;s translation that Beton == concrete.</p>
<p>&quot;Germany, sports, concrete, arrests&#8230; hmmm, sounds vaguely like what I read two weeks ago!&quot;</p>
<p>Amazing what tricks the mind can play on you.<br /></p>

		<p>This reminds me of an American friend who met a French girl in California. He took her to the beach and the girl was very excited because she saw a seal. She started to scream: &quot;Phoque&quot;, &quot;Phoque&quot;, &quot;Phoque&quot;. My friend was very embarassed because &quot;phoque&quot; (which means seal in French) sounds very much like f**k&#8230;</p>

		<p>Ken,</p>
<p>You run in to people who just don&#8217;t think about how things sound before they&#8217;re done. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not incompetence as much as it is simply not realizing the /other/ interpretation.</p>
<p>I wonder if a person is more likely to recognize a 4-7 letter word first in a block of uncapitolized and unspaced text like a URL. &nbsp;When you look at the list of &quot;misleading&quot; URLs, how long are the words you usually recognize first?</p>

		<p>Argl&#8230;It actually took your blog post for me to realise that what they meant was really Bet On Sports&#8230; :S (thanks?)</p>
<p>Being a Dutch native speaker, I made the same mistake, but did not find out I was wrong yet&#8230;</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt; Well, in German there is no &quot;sports&quot; but just &quot;Sport&quot;. So by that little S<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; at the end of sports, you could tell it&#8217;s English.</p>
<p>&gt; It&#8217;s the same in English as it is in German; the little S at the end actually<br />
<br />&gt; tells you it&#8217;s *American*.</p>
<p>Well, you can&#8217;t always tell, enough people don&#8217;t seem to know (or care) about little details like this. Often enough, people (for example, here in germany) seem to think that one can simply get the plural for _every_ english word by appending an &#8216;s&#8217; (many also do it for non-english-words as well, for example one &quot;Pizza&quot;, many &quot;Pizzas&quot; (only &quot;Pizzen&quot; is correct plural in german)).</p>
<p>What also never fails to amuse me (note that I don&#8217;t want to ridicule anyone, foreign languages are hard, I know) is when german words are used in english, but with quite a funny pronounciation, for example &quot;Stau&quot; (traffic jam) is very popular among the AFN (american forces network (radio station)) speakers, with a pronounciation that&#8217;s just plain funny.<br /></p>

		<p>&gt; I remember Americans visiting Germany and <br />&gt; breaking out in laughter when they drove by <br />&gt; a store which, in huge letters, advertised <br />&gt; &#8220;BAD DESIGN&#8221;. </p>
<p>I have to add that in proper German, that should be either &#8220;BADDESIGN&#8221; or at least &#8220;BAD-DESIGN&#8221;. (And in *really* proper German, that should be &#8220;Badeinrichtung&#8221; or &#8220;Badgestaltung&#8221;.) So even if their design wasn&#8217;t bad, their German certainly was. </p>
<p>P.S.: Most recently, many Americans in Germany found it quite disturbing to see Aldi advertise a sale of &#8220;Body bags&#8221;. By which they actually meant rucksacks &#8212; but you know, the German marketing people are somehow convinced that the English &#8220;Body bag&#8221; sounds so much cooler than the German &#8220;Rucksack&#8221;. (Most ironically, noone seems to have told those marketing people that the latter one has been exported into English long time ago, so if they were looking for a cool English word they could have simply stayed with &#8220;Rucksack&#8221; (^_~).)</p>

		<p>Also quite nice in the Win INET API (I think) is HINTERNET, where HINTER means behind. It&#8217;s not only the buttocks thing, German also has the nice word &quot;Hinterw&#228;ldler&quot; which comes to mind with this.</p>

		<p>Another great example are the &quot;power puff girls&quot;.<br />
<br />&#8230;..<br />
<br />&quot;puff&quot; interpreted as german would be &quot;brothel&quot; in english.<br />
<br />I sure looked a bit astonished upon first seeing the logo with some drawing of very young looking girls next to the word &quot;puff&quot;, until it dawned to me that (of course) the word has quite a different meaning in enlish &#8230;<br /></p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
