<p> A customer wanted to move a file and have it forget all its old ACLs and instead inherit its ACLs from its new location. They found <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/08/24/717181.aspx"> an old article of mine</a> that said </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> If you use <code>SH&shy;File&shy;Operation</code> to move a file and pass the <code>FOF_<wbr>NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBUTES</wbr></code> flag, then it will not preserve the original ACLs on the moved files but will rather recalculate them from the destination's inheritable properties. (If you want to do the same thing in your own code, you can call the <code>Set&shy;Named&shy;Security&shy;Info</code> function, specifying that you want an empty, unprotected DACL.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p> They were having trouble implementing the recommendation in parentheses. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We set the file to have an SDDL of <code>D:S:</code> in order to give it an empty DACL and SACL, but instead of inheriting its ACL from the container, that gave nobody any permissions at all! How do I get this to work? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The customer was halfway there. <code>D:S:</code> is an empty DACL. Now they need to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379573(v=vs.85).aspx"> make it unprotected</a>. </p>

<td valign="baseline">The DACL inherits ACEs from the parent object.</td>
</tr>

<p> The customer confirmed that passing that flag to <code>Set&shy;Named&shy;Security&shy;Info</code> did the trick. </p>

		<p>The Security API is an absolute mess. This can only be forgiven as nobody knew what they were doing at the time. Even if MS had looked aside at the UNIX world they would have found the ACL APIs still an unstandardized mess, and MS was trying to separate local and domain accounts. UNIX didn&#39;t bother.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of the fact that empty DACLs mean no one can access the file (save the owner, of course), while null DACLs mean Everyone Full Control.</p>

		<p>@Medinoc: That makes sense though if you think about it historically. &nbsp;FAT filesystems didn&#39;t support ACL metadata, so all of the files and directories effectively had &quot;null ACLs&quot; as far as the operating system was concerned. &nbsp;Since you have to maintain backwards compatibility with these filesystems, you map the behavior to FAT: everyone can change everything.</p>

		<p>Sometimes when answering questions related to issues with non-Administrator users, the answer is to adjust the permissions on your installation folder at install time. You know your installer will have the ability to adjust permissions on your folder, because if it didn&#39;t it wouldn&#39;t be able to install!</p>
<p>But the thing i never answer is actually **how** to adjust NTFS permissions in code. i&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible, i understand a lot of the concepts; but actually translating that into functional code that actually does the correct thing, in the correct way, is very complicated.</p>
<p>Chris Jackson talked about this once in his blog post *&quot;How to Set Directory Permissions at Install Time using an MSI Created Using Windows Installer XML (WIX)&quot;*</p>
<p>&gt; Now, hereâ€™s the part that makes people nuts (and rightly so!) â€“ we then never bother to tell you how you can set that at install time! At best, weâ€™ll give you some hints. Want to know something interesting? Youâ€™d probably be surprised at how many people donâ€™t know how to do this themselves, but nonetheless will happily tell you that itâ€™s what you ought to be doing.</p>
<p>He goes on to explain how to do it using MSI (via WiX).</p>
<p>But i&#39;ve never bothered to actually sit down and spend a few hours figuring out Authorization API. i&#39;ve never sat down to figure out which of the 211 functions need to be called, in what order, to accomplish the equivalent of &quot;grant Modify to Users&quot;.</p>
<p>So i can certainly understand when a guy misses a `UNPROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION` flag.</p>

		<p>When I read the title, I thought it is an article on the topic of moving a file that is set to inherit permissions and eventually not inheriting new permissions.</p>

		<p>In the case when a file is copied/moved to another NTFS volume, there is no way for end users to copy ACLs using Explorer as ForceCopyAclwithFile reg value is ignored. It now always inherits the permissions of the new folder.</p>

		<p>@MNGoldenEagle: although I don&#39;t know how it looks on the API level, the exFAT filesystem also does not support ACLs (except on WinCE), and it&#39;s hardly a &quot;backwards compatibilty&quot; filesystem.</p>

		<p>That&#39;s not what I want when I move a file, I want it to keep explicit entries and only update the inherited entries (I once used an app which did something along the above lines and that failed horribly on a file which wasn&#39;t inheriting anything) which is presumably solved via a prior call to GetNamedSecurityInfo instead of using an empty unprotected DACL.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
