As we all know, users don't read error messages.
And, sad to say, this behavior extends to the group of people
you would think pay the most attention to error messages,
namely, programmers, who are the people who cause your computer to
<i>display</i> the error messages!
</p>
<p>
Today's example comes from an internal
programmer's tool which I will call
<i>Program&nbsp;Q</i>.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
I'm trying to back out an update I made to record 19 of our table
(which was entered as transaction 512),
but I can't get it to work:
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; q backout 512
Transaction opened for record 19 - must reconcile backout

C:\&gt; q commit all
Transaction 520 created for 1 record
Committing transaction 520
<font COLOR=purple>Record 19 - must reconcile backout</font>
<font COLOR=red>Unreconciled changes pending - use 'q reconcile' to resolve
Commit failed -- fix problems above and then use 'q commit 520'</font>
</pre>
<p>
What is the problem here, and how do I fix it?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The transaction couldn't be backed out because somebody else
made a change to record 19 since your original erroneous update,
and the system wants you to reconcile this conflict.
</p>
<p>
But that's beside the point.
The point is that the user here merely saw that there was an error
and didn't actually read any of the error messages.
There were four error messages, and every single one told him
what he needed to do!
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; q backout 512

		<p>Maybe he didn&#8217;t understand something (e.g. what &quot;unreconciled&quot; means &#8211; &quot;conflicting changes&quot; and maybe a pointer to the other transaction where the other changes were actually made would have been clearer) and knew better than to blindly follow instructions included in an error message without understanding what&#8217;s going on.</p>

		<p>Random: Ah, but then the programmer should have asked &quot;I can see that there&#8217;s a problem with reconciliation, but I don&#8217;t understand what could have caused that.&quot;</p>
<p>At least then it becomes a training issue, rather than a &quot;I&#8217;m completely oblivious to everything&quot; problem.</p>

		<p>Like D. Garlans said, if the problem was lack of understanding, it would be entirely justified. However, the message told him more or less exactly what he needed to do, namely &quot;use &#8216;q reconcile&#8217; to resolve&quot;</p>

		<p>What really annoys me is that some of my fellow programmers don&#8217;t have some of the most common Win32 error codes memorized. &nbsp;5 = ACCESS_DENIED, 2 = FILE_NOT_FOUND, etc. &nbsp;These come up ALL THE TIME and they still have to look them up. &nbsp;I mean seriously, if you see something this often you think you would just naturally memorize it at some point. &nbsp;I understand this is somewhat esoteric, but Win32 programmers must encounter these error codes multiple times every day, right? &nbsp;How can you not know these by heart?</p>

<p>The code I write doesn&#8217;t run into the error values often enough for me to know them by heart. &nbsp;OTOH, I get peeved when people don&#8217;t know what U+FEFF or U+FFFD mean, that U+FFFE is invalid (and why) and how many bytes it takes to store U+10117 in UTF-8 and UTF-16.</p>

		<p>While I completely agree with the general premise of this post, I also have difficulty with programs that dump out an error when it appears that the program itself knows how to deal with the problem (or at least what the next step should be).</p>
<p>Given that we are already executing Q, and apparently the correct course of action is to type in &#8220;q reconcile&#8221;, why doesn&#8217;t it just do it (at least to the point of displaying the information). </p>

		<p>Dave: command programs like these are probably intended for automation where unexpectedly executing reconcile will throw the script off (that input you are reading might be a stream intended for some later command in the script).</p>

		<p>@Dave &#8211; adding info like that makes the command harder to script. &nbsp;Right now the output is both short and predictable &#8211; easily parsed. &nbsp;The reconciliation output could be arbitrarily long.</p>
<p>Of course, waiting for user input is also a no-no in this case (assuming &#8216;commit&#8217; doesn&#8217;t normally block on the user).</p>

		<p>Without knowing what q does and what a backout is:</p>
<p>&gt; Transaction opened for record 19 &#8211; must reconcile backout</p>
<p>This is not obviously an instruction to the user. It might mean &#8220;I (the program) will now reconcile backout&#8221;. Some programs do give themselves instructions as a way to tell the user what the program is doing.</p>
<p>&gt; Unreconciled changes pending &#8211; use &#8216;q reconcile&#8217; to resolve</p>
<p>This might mean &#8220;Ureconciled changes pending. I will now use &#8216;q reconcile&#8217; to resolve&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Commit failed &#8212; fix problems above and then use &#8216;q commit 520&#8217;</p>
<p>Even this might be misinterpreted, but it is unlikely and obviously it was not.</p>
<p>Granted, once this last line appears, I would most likely go back up and determine which of the lines of text above is most likely to be mentioning a &#8220;problem&#8221;, but I can see the potential for not immediately seeing why there&#8217;s an error.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Don&#8217;t waste time with a detailed textual analysis &#8211; I just made up those messages myself. They aren&#8217;t the actual error messages. (Besides, the manual for the Q program goes into more detail on the backout process.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Just like boris, I interpreted the message &quot;blabla &#8212; must do something&quot; as a &quot;talky program explains what the mentioned program must to do, not what I have to do.&quot; One &quot;you&quot; is missing there, or &quot;must&quot; is too much: &quot;reconcile backout first!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unreconciled changes pending&quot; is also not the obvious wording unless you really know the semantics. &quot;Pending&quot;? Doesn&#8217;t say if the action successful or not? Maybe &quot;pending&quot; is something normal, exactly what should happen. But &quot;use &#8216;q reconcile&#8217; to resolve&quot; is obviously a direction to the user, the first time something useful. So it&#8217;s probable that &quot;Unreconciled changes pending&quot; in fact meant &quot;Unreconciled changes were not accepted&quot;.</p>
<p>The last line is clearly understandable. But it refers to &quot;problems before&quot; which are at least a bit probelmatically stated.</p>

		<p>Given the context, I smell fear. Source control programs are notoriously finicky and full of hard-to-understand, nuanced behavior, and the penalty for making a mistake is deleted work&#8212;yours or someone else&#8217;s.</p>
<p>I suspect that this user had been burned by failure to understand the options the program was presenting before, and seeing this unexpected error message, they were going to an experienced human for help. While they could probably understand the situation with a bit of thought, the penalty for mistakes may have been too high to try, in their opinion. What if the program &#8216;reconciles&#8217; by throwing out the working copy?</p>
<p>If I were to make one change to this UI, I&#8217;d add a &#8216;?&#8217; option to get directly to the relevant section of the manual.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s surprising to me how many otherwise competent and productive developers don&#8217;t think source control is something they should have to invest brain cycles to learn. In a case like this, I think &quot;RTFM&quot; is an acceptable answer, but a touch of empathy for the hours of productivity lost in the past would also be appreciated.</p>

<p>As a member of a team that makes a q program, I have been interested in better ways for the UI to communicate what must be done; it seems to me that Raymond&#8217;s view is that, after some point of clarity, it doesn&#8217;t matter as much, because the user hasn&#8217;t bothered reading it; as you say, there is probably some sort of aversion or fear involved there.</p>
<p>My favourite is that we had long had an error message that basically said &#8220;no permission to thingamajig&#8221;.</p>
<p>After several years of supporting the message and getting a lot of queries asking what could cause them to not have permission, I pushed for putting more information in to explain the common reasons and how to get in touch with the administrators for the specific q server instance that they are using. The message was changed to something like &#8220;no permission to thingamajig; see &#8216;q help permissions&#8217;.&#8221; and a help topic was written to explain the several common reasons for this state followed by something like &#8220;If the above seem to be correct, please contact your server&#8217;s admins at _____&#8221; with an admin defined mailto: or http: URL.</p>
<p>After this was put into place, we still get asked about the error message; they almost always cut and paste the error message and ask what it means. [Incidentally, they are always positive that they do have permissions.] The first reply that I always do is to quote their error message:</p>
<p>&#8220;no permission to thingamajig; see &#8216;q help permissions&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did you run &#8216;q help permissions&#8217;?</p>
<p>Invariably, it&#8217;s the same answer:</p>
<p>No.</p>

		<p>Come on guys. This is a standard situation in Subversion and possibly many other version control systems. If there are conflicting changes, the software tells you to go *review* and *merge* these changes.</p>
<p>I am a bit bemused by this: Raymond tells a humorous story, the setup of which describes a common behaviour of some programming tools. But since a piece of *internal* software is mentioned as an example, everybody proceeds to pick the software apart and argue that its messages are too cryptic and that it should operate automatically etc. etc.</p>
<p>I believe the program is doing what it&#8217;s gotta do, and as Raymond repeatedly mentions, it is beside the point anyway.</p>
<p>Nice story, thanks.</p>

		<p>What boggles my mind is when a fellow programmer (or a sysadmin) reads the error message but then their brain just shuts down.</p>
<p>Them: Hey, I&#8217;m trying to modify the database and I&#8217;m getting a &quot;Operation must use an updateable query&quot; error. I&#8217;ve been working on this for an hour and can&#8217;t figure it out. &nbsp;Do you have any ideas?</p>
<p>Me: Did you Goog^H^H^H^HBing the error message?</p>
<p>Them: No, why?</p>
<p>Me, 5-10 seconds later: It probably means the permissions on the database are wrong. &nbsp;Fix your ACLs.</p>
<p>Them: Oh, wow, that works! Thanks! &nbsp;How did you know that?!</p>
<p>Me: *sigh*</p>
<p>Even if the error message isn&#8217;t terribly helpful, search engines for the Internets have been around for a while. &nbsp;Use them!</p>

		<p>I can relate to the fear thing if this is about source control, but I generally go to someone I trust with source control and ask them &#8216;Is it OK to blindly follow the instruction the program is giving me or should I take some action first (like make a local backup, just in case).</p>
<p>But never &#8216;huh? wut? error message?&#8217;</p>

		<p>The following is an example why you should not always do what the program tells you. All credits go to Joel Spolsky, this is an excerpt from his Mercury tutorial.</p>
<p>C:Usersjoelrecipes&gt; hg push</p>
<p>pushing to <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://joel.example.com:8000/" rel="nofollow">http://joel.example.com:8000/</a></p>
<p>searching for changes</p>
<p>abort: push creates new remote heads!</p>
<p>(did you forget to merge? use push -f to force)</p>
<p>Ahhh!! Failure! By the way… that message you see there? The one that says use push -f to force? That’s terrible advice. Never, ever, EVER use push -f to force. You will regret it. Trust me for now.</p>

		<p>prunoki: typical users might fall into the trap of interpreting that as &quot;advice&quot;, but you as a dev should know that computers don&#8217;t give advice. red flags should be flapping like crazy if you blindly follow an instruction like that message without understanding WHY. devs tell computers what to do, not the other way around.</p>

		<p>I suspect CYA could be at work here. If X does only what he&#8217;s trained to do, he can&#8217;t be blamed if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Even though the error tells X exactly what to do, it might not have been in the training. So instead, he escalates it and waits for someone else who can be pointed at and blamed if the reconcile goes wrong.</p>
<p>(&quot;Not my fault. I only did what the support man said to do.&quot;)</p>

		<p>I actually just had something kind of similar happen to me just now. I sometimes do helpdesk support for employees. Had someone call up saying website X is not working. This was an external website that we encourage our users to use but we do not directly support or control but I’d figure I would give it a shot.</p>
<p>Me: what isn&#8217;t working; does the website not come up at all? Does your password not work? Does and error display? &nbsp;</p>
<p>User: I cannot login.</p>
<p>Me: ok does it say the password is wrong?</p>
<p>User: no I type in my password and it says I need to confirm my email address? But I don’t see my page</p>
<p>Me: ok, what happens when you confirm you email address?</p>
<p>User: I don’t know</p>
<p>Me: Try typing in your email address and hitting ok (I hadn’t actually seen the page but my physic powers told me there would be a spot to type in an email address and an ok button)</p>
<p>User: my page is there now Thank you.</p>

		<p>To be fair, Jeremy and Raymond aren&#8217;t in the best position to judge whether these error messages are being read. &nbsp;They only hear about it when the messages are not read. &nbsp;No-one sends them email to say &quot;by the way, I ran &#8216;q reconcile&#8217; like the error suggested and it solved my problem.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like working in a poison control center and saying &quot;people sure have a hard time reading the instructions on paint thinner.&quot;</p>

		<p>Jeremy Morton:</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve been doing lately is to always output three lines of error report:</p>
<ol>
<li>The error and its cause.</li>
<li>
<p>How to fix it in plain English.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The actual command to fix it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Usually in the form:</p>
<p>Error: cannot do X because of Y.</p>
<p>To be able to do X, you must first do Z.</p>
<p>(Actual command that would do Z.)</p>
<p>So q is really quite close, but the inital error might be too terse. Applying my method, I&#8217;d expect:</p>
<p>C:&gt; q backout 512</p>
<p>Cannot backout 512 due to conflicts in record 19.</p>
<p>You must reconcile the changes to record 19 in order to backout 512.</p>
<p>Try the command: q reconcile</p>

		<p>I agree that if the user has fears or concerns about unexpected consequences, they should state those when asking for help. Same if they feel the error message is unclear &#8211; if there&#8217;s to be any hope of addressing this problem, the authors of the program need to know about it.</p>

		<p>Actually, &#8220;104,&#8221; the Mercurial guide says this: &#8220;If at any place any command complains, your best bet is to read what it tells you and follow that advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>So there we have an explicit example of software giving advice to devs. (Only devs would use Mercurial, after all.) Spolsky advises ignoring the guide&#8217;s instructions, at least in the case of &#8220;hg push.&#8221;</p>
<p>Too often we encounter error messages that don&#8217;t really tell us what the problem is. &#8220;The parameter is incorrect.&#8221; &#8220;PC Load Letter.&#8221; When that happens often enough, we form the idea that no error message tells us what the problem is, and so it&#8217;s not worth reading any at all. Instead, we should go find our local technical expert and ask for help.</p>
<p>I think the only remedy for that is to continue to write good, accurate error messages. And not just trivially accurate (&#8220;an error occurred&#8221;), but accurate and useful to the people who are likely to encounter it in the wild.</p>
<p>I try to explain to people that indeed sometimes error messages aren&#8217;t accurate. They indicate something is wrong, but they don&#8217;t correctly diagnose the problem. But only sometimes. Other times, an error message might really mean exactly what it says, and unless we have evidence that the message is wrong <em>this</em> time, we really need to give the computer the benefit of the doubt and assume the message is correct. (For instance, sometimes when the compiler says it expected a semicolon, it really means you&#8217;re missing a semicolon, no matter how many times another semicolon would just lead to more and worse syntax errors.)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
