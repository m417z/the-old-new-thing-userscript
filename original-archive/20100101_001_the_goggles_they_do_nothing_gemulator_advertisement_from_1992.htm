		<p>I just watched the full version (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4915875929930836239&amp;q=windows+386&amp;hl=en#" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4915875929930836239&#038;q=windows+386&#038;hl=en#</a>)&#8230; nothing can describe it better than the description of who uploaded it:</p>
<p>&quot;Microsoft sent this tape to retailers to explain the benefits of Windows 386. Boring until the 7 minute mark when the production is taken over by crack-smoking monkeys.&quot;</p>

		<p>Seeing that Butler&#8217;s store at the beginning took me back. &nbsp;We got our first ST at Butler&#8217;s in &#8217;86 (at the old store location with the view of the Sound out back). &nbsp;I remember first seeing Gemulator at the new Butler&#8217;s store when we took in a ST floppy drive for a repair (yet again&#8230;) and thinking our problems were solved &#8211; until I found out Gemulator didn&#8217;t do MIDI or games!</p>

		<p>Wow &#8212; the most interesting thing I got out of Darek&#8217;s blog was how to upgrade XP to Windows 7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Short answer: &nbsp;Obtain the DVD for any version of Vista (which you can get cheaply these days), upgrade XP to Vista without entering the Vista product key (there&#8217;s a 30-day grace period), apply Vista SP1, then upgrade that to Windows 7. &nbsp;It sounds complicated, but it may be easier and faster than a clean install of Windows 7 and then reinstalling all of your applications.</p>

		<p>Given the title and the pre-emptive snark, I think I can ask a question that I&#8217;ve wondered occasionally about for quite some time, but would have been off-topic&#8230; until today!</p>
<p>By any chance are you the Raymond Chen who authored (or at least compiled) quite a few of the Simpsons episode capsules on snpp.com?</p>

		<p>@mikeb:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always assumed that was the case; since one of the later FAQs that came out of alt.tv.simpsons credited &quot;Raymond Chen&quot; with a Microsoft email address.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ve also always assumed I was the only person who worked that out. :P )</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m not mistaken, he actually wrote the first a.t.s FAQ, as well as all the ep caps he was involved with.</p>

		<p>Hmm&#8230; I never thought to look (or search) for some mention of Microsoft. &nbsp;Or maybe I was just too lazy. I&#8217;d just say to myself, &quot;hey, I wonder if that&#8217;s the same Raymond?&quot; and move on.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, &quot;if something&#8217;s hard to do, then it&#8217;s not worth doing&quot;. &nbsp;And I&#8217;m OK with saying it would have been hard to do.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
