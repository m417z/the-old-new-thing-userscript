<p> Hans Bjordahl's <a href="http://www.bugbash.net/"> <i>Bug Bash</i></a> is one of those <i>it's funny because it's true</i> comics about life inside a software company. Specifically, <a href="http://www.bugbash.net/comic/120.html"> Microsoft</a>, where Hans worked for many years and whose internal newsletter featured <a href="http://www.bugbash.net/archives/comic"> Hans's strip</a>. (Some might argue that <i>Bug Bash</i> was the only part of the company newsletter worth reading.) </p>
<p> Today I'm going to share two of my favorites. </p>
<ul>
<li>     <a href="http://www.bugbash.net/comic/94.html">     Internal marketing campaigns</a>.     The year 2004 was a particularly     good one     (or in     the opinion of     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/">some people</a>:     a particularly bad one)     for internal     marketing campaigns at Microsoft,     with about forty pieces of internal marketing delivered to     your maildrop during the year.     That's a piece of internal junk mail nearly every week!     Perhaps in response, the year 2005 was unusually sparse.     But internal marketing appears to be on the rise again,     though fortunately not yet to the heights of 2004. </li>
<li>     <a href="http://www.bugbash.net/comic/103.html">     Blog all you want</a>.     The subtitle on the fake newspaper headline wins it. </li>
</ul>
<p> Bonus discovery, Hans <a href="http://www.bugbash.net/archives/article/2007/04/everyones-a-critic.html"> revealed himself</a> as the co-founder of <a href="http://www.mrcranky.com/"> Mr. Cranky</a>. Man, I loved that site. </p>

		<p>I&#39;m confused. Aren&#39;t comic strips supposed to be funny? Or is this one of those soap opera ones?</p>

		<p>Like a lot of Dilbert strips, I don&#39;t so much laugh as cringe at those strips because of how accurately they reflect life at megacorporations.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s a little in-jokey; I prefer comics that take me &lt;i&gt;away&lt;/i&gt; from work.</p>
<p>I did find it amusing that the series ended on furry porn. We ruin everything!</p>
<p>(The strip was also posted the month before the first instance of SeaTac&#39;s Rainfurrest <a href="https://www.rainfurrest.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.rainfurrest.org/</a>. Coincidence?)</p>

		<p>&quot;Bug Bash&quot; &#8212; because punchlines are so 20th century.</p>
<p>&quot;Bug Bash&quot; &#8212; bad enough to make xkcd seem mildly amusing.</p>
<p>&quot;Bug Bash&quot; &#8212; making &quot;User Friendly&quot; look varied and insightful.</p>
<p>&quot;Bug Bash&quot; &#8212; if Microsoft made comic strips&#8230;</p>
<p>Seriously, they&#39;re terrible.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
