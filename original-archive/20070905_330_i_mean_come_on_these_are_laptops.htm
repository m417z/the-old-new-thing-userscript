<p> Last year, <a href="http://weekendamerica.publicradio.org/"> <i>Weekend America</i></a> (co-hosted by former Seattleite Bill Radke&mdash;we miss you, Bill!) did <a href="http://weekendamerica.publicradio.org/programs/index_20060506.html#plork"> a story on the Princeton Laptop Orchestra</a>, which calls itself <a href="http://plork.cs.princeton.edu/"> PLOrk</a>. It's an interesting experiment, but computer music doesn't really move me. It's not the computer-ness that bugs me (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/18/134052.aspx">I was fascinated by music played on Gameboys</a>, after all) but rather the lack of traditional musicality. </p>
<p> That said, the chord that opens the piece on online gambling creeps me out. Not because of the piece itself, but because it is dangerously reminiscent of the chord played at the Tulalip Casino, a steady synthesized triad played at low volume so you can barely hear it. And after a while, you simply stop hearing it, and then you have to whack yourself on the head and make yourself hear it again because allowing it to sink into your subconscious means that they've won. </p>

		<p>What is this semi-audible chord you speak of? &nbsp;I&#8217;ve never been to a casino, nor do I expect to anytime. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first brought my new noise-canceling headphones to work, I was surprised to find out there was a considerable level of white noise going on that I&#8217;d never noticed. &nbsp;A coworker told me it was done because it reduces the perception of crowd noise in our converted-warehouse office building.</p>

		<p>i saw a presentation by the leader of the group a few months ago and I was completely underwhelmed. I&#8217;ve seen people make great music with two sticks and a piece of string, or with random bits of electronics, but this was really technology for technology&#8217;s sake. After the presentation someone asked (completely reasonably IMO) for the leader to hum the tune of one of their pieces and the guy pretended not to understand the question. yawn.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
