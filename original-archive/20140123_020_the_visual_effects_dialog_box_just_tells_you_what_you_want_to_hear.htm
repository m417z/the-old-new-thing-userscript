<p>The <i>Visual Effects</i> dialog box has three options, "Let Windows choose what's best for my computer," "Adjust for best appearance," and "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/03/27/10405554.aspx">Adjust for <strike>crappiest appearance</strike> best performance</a>." Some people have discovered the registry key where the Visual Effects dialog box remembers which radio button was most recently checked, but they found that when they programmatically manipulate the registry key, there is no effect on the actual visual settings.</p>
<p> What's going on? </p>
<p> What's going on is that the registry key is just there to tell you what you want to hear. It remembers which radio button you clicked, so that when you reopen the dialog box, the same radio button will be selected by default. </p>
<p> The actual work of changing the setting happens when you click the OK or Apply button. The registry key is just for show. </p>
<p> If you want to change a Visual Effects setting programmatically, you need to make the corresponding API call for that visual effect. For example, you might call <code>System&shy;Parameters&shy;Info</code> with the <code>SPI_<wbr>SET&shy;NON&shy;CLIENT&shy;ANIMATION</wbr></code> flag to programmatically enable or disable non-client animation. </p>
<p> Note of course that by doing this you are using a global solution to a local problem. The user's visual effects preferences should be modified by the user, not by a program. </p>

		<p>Agreed! &nbsp;I use a particular program for remote access to my workplace. This program disabled all sorts of visual effects on my end and doesn&#39;t restore them when the program closes. I have to open up the appearance settings, make a change so the apply button becomes available and then save my changes to get my settings back.</p>

		<p>Here&#39;s something I&#39;d like to know: why is it that in Windows 8/8.1 the option to give the cursor a drop shadow became disabled by default?</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to put on my Raymond hat and try to psychically deduce that the answer has something to do with the overhead from adding the shadow/figuring in the shadow when rendering window contents is seen as not being worthwhile for such a small detail.</p>

		<p>&quot;Best performance&quot; actually does provide the best performance when using a utility like VNC.</p>
<p>While it&#39;s a good thing that Windows includes a default remote desktop facility that properly manages visual effects and sends only the necessary commands to the remote client, it&#39;s unfortunate that it doesn&#39;t support screen sharing, which necessitates the use of a screen-scraping utility like VNC.</p>

		<p>@Entegy</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know about combos but if you have a variable height owner draw list box then, with smooth scrolling enabled, it actually looks like it is scrolling backwards as you move down the list, a very bizarre and unpleasant experience.</p>

		<p>@Maurits I agree with @ender. 99.9% of the time, &quot;Remote Assistance&quot; requires hours of remote assistance to get everything working (barely) enough to allow you to connect to someone&#39;s machine. You&#39;re then not only providing assistance with their Windows desktop, but their security software, router, and ISP.</p>
<p>Whereas you can, say, send them to Join.me and have them running in all of a three-second download.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>@Neil No. But why would you spend all that time reading two dozen registry values when you could instead just read one?</p>

		<p>Raymond, &quot;best performance&quot; is not &quot;crappiest appearance&quot;, as your strikethrough implies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the sliding and smooth-scrolling makes me nauseous, and wastes valuable time. &nbsp;I think the appearance is far, far better when visual elements snap into place immediately instead of sliding around and animatedly slowly to where they will end up. &nbsp;IMO, best performance and best appearance are synonymous &#8212; uncheck every selection that has &quot;fade&quot; or &quot;slide&quot; or &quot;animate&quot; or &quot;smooth scroll&quot; in its name. &nbsp;The appearance is terrific that way. &nbsp;Best appearance does require &quot;smooth edges of screen fonts&quot; (Cleartype), which is a different thing entirely.</p>

		<p>If you are not a fan of animations, on Windows 8, the appearance isn&#39;t so crappy if only &quot;Smooth edges of screen fonts&quot; is checked and all the rest are unchecked. Although personally I keep all enabled. On Windows 7, turning Desktop composition off really made the appearance crappy.</p>
<p>@benjamin You should thank them that they didn&#39;t remove the ability for the pointer to have a shadow just for fun and games. For a company who wastes time in getting the Windows logo animation perfect instead of fixing serious usability issues for several years, this is expected.</p>

		<p>You would think microsoft would update those settings to follow what is now measured as best performance. Could even provide a small update now in order to correct it.</p>
<p>Another sign of windows have become bloated? So many &quot;features&quot; and bad coding (maintainability). That old features get forgotten and not updated.</p>
<p>Only the hyped up features get the attention. If you file a bug it will only get ignored, marked as wontfix or works for me.</p>
<p>Still remember when windows could be run quite fine on only 128mb of ram. Only reason you upgraded ram was for the games. I miss those times. Windows was somehow more lean and efficient compared to now.</p>
<p>After all the less space the operating system eats up (metro ui) the more space is free for the applications.</p>
<p>Microsoft have forgotten what the main task of an operating system. Answer: A stable platform to run applications on.</p>
<p>Windows 8 wants the user to stay in metro land as long as possible. &quot;No no child stay here a little longer&quot; said metro while locking the door behind the user.</p>
<p>@Joshua xpclient actually do have a valid point. Microsoft often&#8230;always allocate time (aka resource allocation) incorrectly. Giving low priority stuff much time.</p>
<p>Not to mention microsoft have a habit of doing the opposite of what common sense and intelligence would tell them. Like force metro on desktop (keyboard and mouse) users going so far as to remove the start menu completely.</p>
<p>Moving the screen up in order to login is a pain in the ***. It&#39;s one extra step which is totally unnecessary. Just like how adding interface on top of interface wastes cpu time. Compare a stack dump of a common program between windows xp and windows 8 to see what i mean.</p>

		<p>&quot;let Windows decide&quot; seems to have nothing to do with the capabilities of your system, but rather just a preset list based on style. No drop shadow on mouse pointer anymore in Windows 8 is probably much more to do with the new flat design aesthetic than the cost of rendering the shadow.</p>

		<p>@Bahl</p>
<p>Agree entirely that Win8 and Metro are garbage.</p>
<p>That said, don&#39;t use invalid complaints in your argument: You don&#39;t need to slide the screen up. Just start typing, hit space/enter, etc.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
