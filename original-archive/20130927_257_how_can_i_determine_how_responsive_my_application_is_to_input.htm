<p>A customer was adding diagnostics to their application and wanted to know if there was a way to detect that the application was being slow in processing its input. These sorts of delays manifest themselves to the end user as a sluggish application which is slow to respond to input events.</p>
<p> They already had a watchdog timer that was reset every time their <code>Get&shy;Message</code> call returned a message, so they could capture stack traces if their application stopped processing messages for more than X&nbsp;milliseconds. They wanted to extend this diagnostic information to input delays. </p>
<p> Fortunately, there's an easy way to tell. The <code>Get&shy;Message&shy;Time</code> will tell you the time the message was added to the queue, so by subtracting that time from the current <code>Get&shy;Tick&shy;Count</code>, you can determine how long the input message sat in the queue. (Sent messages are not queued messages, so calling <code>Get&shy;Message&shy;Time</code> for a sent message doesn't work.) </p>
<p> There's a catch, here, though. </p>
<p> Since mouse messages are generated on demand, the <code>Get&shy;Message&shy;Time</code> for a <code>WM_<wbr>MOUSE&shy;MOVE</wbr></code> message is usually "Just now." (It could be older if you forced a mouse move message to be generated but left it in the queue.) To get the actual time the mouse moved, you need to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/03/14/10282406.aspx"> use <code>Get&shy;Mouse&shy;Move&shy;Points&shy;Ex</code></a>. </p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
