		<p>Brilliant! &nbsp;Thanks for the chuckle, Raymond.</p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking of changing my surname now, for disassociation purposes.</p>

		<p>As ridiculous as it sounds, not every item is as ridiculous as it sounds. For example, the waffle batter dispenser is probably quite useful for making uniformly sized pancakes (and you&#39;d probably use the same batter). And $600 for a chicken coop is almost downright cheap.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I&#39;m pretty sure the waffle batter dispenser is really a pancake batter dispenser incorrectly marketed. It&#39;s pretty pointless as a waffle batter dispenser, because the waffle iron does the shaping and portion control for you. And portion control is actually counter-productive because you will just underfill or overfill the waffle iron. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@Neil: That was my thought too&#8230; And by the standards of some &quot;luxury&quot; Christmas crackers, $30 for a dozen is nowhere near the top end. &nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.harrods.com/product/romanov-luxury-christmas-crackers/harrods/000000000002794100?cat1=new-christmas&amp;cat2=new-christmas-crackers&quot;&gt;Harrods" rel="nofollow">http://www.harrods.com/&#8230;/000000000002794100</a> have a set at £599 for a half-dozen&lt;/a&gt;.</p>
<p>(Personally, we go for the £2 a dozen Asda-own-brand, because we really want paper hats that tear too easily, plastic mini-bowling sets and fish that tell us our emotional state)</p>

		<p>@Gabe: It is as ridiculous as it sounds. The reason is that you already dirtied the measuring cups to measure the ingredients in the batter. You just use the correct one that puts in the right amount for your waffle iron (and you figure this out after the first time you use it, having that knowledge forever more). Cheap and one less thing to wash.</p>
<p>Also, people who would pay $600 for a chicken coop are the ones who will be first to die off when the apocalypse happens, as they apparently don&#39;t have the skills to build something for themselves out of next-to-nothing, costing next-to-nothing. You should be able to build a coop of that size (from new materials no-less) for less than $200.</p>

		<p>Brian_EE: I&#39;ll let you fight it out with my wife.</p>
<p>She uses a ladle because you can leave it in the batter without the handle getting covered. Every pancake she makes is a different size and batter drips all over the stove.</p>
<p>As for the chicken coop, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d love to see your BOM for one of a similar size and quality that costs less than $200.</p>
<p>Additionally, you seem to be unaware of the concept of &quot;opportunity cost&quot;. Even if I have the skills to do something doesn&#39;t mean I have the time or wherewithall. It&#39;s quite likely that I&#39;d rather spend my time playing with my children or tending my chickens than sourcing lumber and sawing it.</p>
<p>And even if I have the skills, time, and wherewithall, I may not have the tools or experience to be able to do it nearly as well. That&#39;s why even people who know how to cook still go to restaurants, and people who know how to program still use premade software.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
