<p>Some Aussie ex-pats developed a list of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.coolabah.com/sweden/youknow.html">You know you've been in Sweden too long when...</a>&rdquo;.  My friend who is acting as my host (and who is himself a U.S. ex-pat) says that the list is astonishingly accurate, and that your reaction to it goes through several phases.</p>
<ol>
<li>Confusion. You don't know what the list is talking about.</li>
<li>Amusement. You know what the list is talking about and you find it funny.</li>
<li>Realization. You find yourself agreeing with the statements on the list.</li>
<li>Acceptance. This list isn't funny. It's just the way it is.</li>
</ol>
<p>  For example, my friend explained points 73 and 74 to me. In Sweden, when the temperature reaches a certain never-explicitly-stated-but-everybody-somehow-agrees-on-it point, it officially becomes summer and you are not allowed to wear winter clothes regardless of the actual temperature. Similarly, when the temperature first dips below a certain point, it officially becomes winter and you are not allowed to wear summer clothes.  </p>
<p>  My friend woke up one morning and noticed that it had dipped below freezing overnight. But it was warm when he got up, so he dressed appropriately for the temperature. What he didn't realize was that 0C was the secret "winter point". Everybody was bundled up for the coming blizzard, even though it was no longer freezing outside.  </p>
<p>  I myself experienced a variation on 249. I was in <a href="http://www.ahlens.com/">&Aring;hl&eacute;ns</a> and there was a sign that read, "If you don't see your size, please ask for it." (Paraphrased from Swedish.) So I asked a passing employee if they had this particular pair of shoes available in a size 36. The employee got rather annoyed at me and told me to go stand in line at the register.  </p>
<p>  Because if you want somebody to help you, you have to stand in line at the register and wait your turn - even though you aren't actually buying anything yet. When you reach the front of the line, the register person fetches the shoe you want. Fortunately, I was satisfied with the shoe she retrieved for me without trying it on (I was buying it for somebody else). If I had to try it on for size, I probably would have had to stand in line a second time.  </p>
<p>  One of the "Adjusting to life in Sweden" books I read mentioned that the intense "nobody is better than anybody else" attitude in Sweden means that customer service is an oxymoron. If nobody is better than anybody else, then service personnel have no obligation to help you. The book noted, "This may take quite a bit of adjustment for people who come from other countries. Except the British."  </p>

		<p>I come from Norway (although I don&#8217;t live there now), and it is as you know the neighbouring country to Sweden. So sadly enough, I do recknognise what you are describing here. That&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;m not going back :D</p>

		<p>Being from central Europe I must say that it&#8217;s not nearly scandivanian only behavior, I guess most of Europe acts like customers are bugging the sales people. As Thomas, I&#8217;m definitely not going back&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve lived in Sweden for 20+ years (since I was born, in fact) and while many of the things and behaviours in the list correspond to &quot;normal&quot; swedishness, the vast majority of list items certainly does not. Unless the author was hanging out with some really weird swedes .. was he in Gothenburg (G&#246;teborg) by any chance? :)</p>
<p>Yeah yeah, I know. It&#8217;s a joke. Laugh. But if the author had gone for quality instead of quantity (note how many of the items on the list refer to the exact same thing?), the joke would have been much better, undoubtably.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s interesting to read the impressions of people from other countries.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m from Sweden and I don&#8217;t think employees behave like that at all stores. If I get no help when I ask for it I simply don&#8217;t go there anymore.</p>
<p>But, &#197;hl&#233;ns may be one of those stores though.<br />
<br />I recommend reading a short funny story by Fredrik Lindstr&#246;m on this subject. It&#8217;s called &quot;K&#228;rringarna p&#229; &#197;hl&#233;ns&quot; and is available in the book &quot;Vad g&#246;r alla superok&#228;nda m&#228;nniskor hela dagarna&quot;. Also available on audio CD read by the author.</p>

		<p>Btw Raymond, you must have come across a really anal warehouse employee. You generally should NOT have to stand in line for stuff like that (even at &#197;hlens). Even someone accustomed to sweden would be offended by something like that. (Where someone = me, of course.)</p>

		<p>Being finnish I noticed many of the points are accurate, but few seem really weird, even for sweden&#8230;.</p>

		<p>Yup, being Swedish it&#8217;s quite fun to see what other people think about us and many things match, but some things seems to be that most ex-pats in Sweden seems to live in Stockholm.<br />
<br />G&#246;teborg is a lot &quot;warmer&quot; than Stockholm and walking away from someone who politely asks a question isn&#8217;t done here (in G&#246;teborg). In fact I was myself chocked when I visited Stockholm and approached several people to ask some question and each time was given a panic-struck stare and then they simply walked away.<br />
<br />And the thing about not walking on red lights, I&#8217;m not sure about Stockholm but in G&#246;teborg we do it all the time. I always think it strange when I go to Denmark and they don&#8217;t do it there.<br />
<br />However the thing about service-mind is spot on. Swedish people could do with a better service-mind.</p>

		<p>I think the list would be extremely correct if it were about Germany! It is amazing how much I started to count on the bus not being 2 minutes late<br />
<br />I guess we found that the link between Germany and Sweden goes further away than &quot;Everybody is blonde&quot;</p>

		<p>Peter is right. In the US, German cars like Mercedes and BMW are targeted at the very rich.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
