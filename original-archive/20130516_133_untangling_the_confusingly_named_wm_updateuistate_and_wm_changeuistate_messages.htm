<p>I always get confused by the <code>WM_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> and <code>WM_<wbr>CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> messages, and I have to go figure them out each time I need to mess with them. So this time, I'm going to write it down so I don't forget. Because the act of writing it down helps me to remember.</p>
<p> It's like in school, where the teacher says, "This is a closed-book, closed-notes exam, but you are allowed to bring one piece of standard 8&frac12;&Prime;&times;11&Prime; paper with you, on which you can write anything you like. No funny business." You work really hard to create the ultimate sheet of paper to bring to the exam, and then it turns out that during the exam, you barely refer to it at all. Because the act of deciding what to put on the cheat sheet made you remember the material. </p>
<p> Part of the problem with the messages <code>WM_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> and <code>WM_<wbr>CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> is their confusing names, because to most people <i>update</i> and <i>change</i> are basically the same concept. The difference is the direction the message travels. Before we look at that, let's look at the mysterious <code>WPARAM</code>. </p>
<p> The <code>WPARAM</code> specifies what action you want to perform (initialize, set, or clear) and the target of the action (focus, accelerators, or both). </p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="black" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<th>Action</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>UIS_SET</code></td>
<td>Set the flag (hide the indicator).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>UIS_CLEAR</code></td>
<td>Clear the flag (show the indicator).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>UIS_INITIALIZE</code></td>
<td>Set or clear the flag     based on whether the last input event was mouse (set)     or keyboard (clear).</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> Setting a flag hides the corresponding indicator. For example, if you have a <code>UIS_<wbr>SET</wbr></code> for <code>UISF_<wbr>HIDE&shy;FOCUS</wbr></code>, that means that you want to hide focus indicators. </p>
<p> Clearing a flag shows the corresponding indicator. For example, if you have a <code>UIS_<wbr>CLEAR</wbr></code> for <code>UISF_<wbr>HIDE&shy;FOCUS</wbr></code>, that means that you want to show focus indicators. </p>
<p> Yes, it's a bit of a double-negative situation. </p>
<p> Each window has its own internal state that remembers which indicators have been hidden for that window. You can query this state by sending the window a <code>WM_<wbr>QUERY&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message. </p>
<p> The <code>WM_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message travels down the tree: When a window receives the <code>WM_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message, it updates its state according to the <code>WPARAM</code> and then forwards the message to its children. Therefore, if you want to change the state for an entire window tree, you can send the <code>WM_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message to the top-level window, and the message will be delivered to that window and all its children. </p>
<p> It's called <i>update</i> because it says, "Okay, listen up everybody, this is what we're going to do." </p>
<p> The <code>WM_<wbr>CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message is more like a change <i>request</i>. It travels up the tree: When a window receives the message, it sees if the state being requested matches the window's current state. If so, then processing stops since there is nothing to change. Otherwise, the window forwards the message to its parent. The idea here is to push the change request up the tree until it finds the top-level window. </p>
<p> If a top-level window receives a <code>WM_<wbr>CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message for a state change that actually changes something, it turns around and sends itself a <code>WM_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message, which as we saw before, tells the entire window tree to set its indicator state to the value specified. </p>
<p> Okay, let's draw a picture. Suppose we have a top-level window with two children, and suppose that everybody starts out with all indicators hidden. </p>

<p> Window&nbsp;B decides that it wants to show accelerators, say because the user tapped the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key. It sends itself a <code>WM_<wbr>CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message with a <code>wParam</code> of <code>MAKEWPARAM(<wbr>UIS_<wbr>CLEAR, UISF_<wbr>HIDE&shy;ACCEL)</wbr></wbr></wbr></code>. </p>
<p> The <code>WM_<wbr>CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message handler for Window&nbsp;B sees that the <code>UISF_<wbr>HIDE&shy;ACCEL</wbr></code> flag is set, so the <i>clear</i> action is meaningful. It forwards the request to its parent, Window&nbsp;A. </p>
<p> The <code>WM_<wbr>CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message handler for Window&nbsp;A also sees that the <code>UISF_<wbr>HIDE&shy;ACCEL</wbr></code> flag is set, so the <i>clear</i> action is meaningful. Since it has no parent, Window&nbsp;A converts the <code>WM_<wbr>CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message to a <code>WM_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message and sends it to itself. </p>
<p> The <code>WM_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message handler for Window&nbsp;A sees that it is being told to clear the <code>UISF_<wbr>HIDE&shy;ACCEL</wbr></code> flag, so it clears the flag and then forwards the mesage to both its children. </p>
<p> Each of the child windows B&nbsp;and&nbsp;C receive the <code>WM_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message and see that they are also being told to clear the <code>UISF_<wbr>HIDE&shy;ACCEL</wbr></code> flag, so they do so. Those windows have no children of their own, so message processing stops. By this mechanism, Window&nbsp;B has managed to convince all the other windows in the hierarchy to clear the <code>UISF_<wbr>HIDE&shy;ACCEL</wbr></code> flag. </p>

<p> Now, suppose that Window&nbsp;C also decides to clear the accelerator indicator. It does the same thing as Window&nbsp;B and sends itself a <code>WM_<wbr>CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message with a <code>wParam</code> of <code>MAKEWPARAM(<wbr>UIS_<wbr>CLEAR, UISF_<wbr>HIDE&shy;ACCEL)</wbr></wbr></wbr></code>. This time, the <code>WM_<wbr>CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message handler for Window&nbsp;C sees that the <code>UISF_<wbr>HIDE&shy;ACCEL</wbr></code> flag is already clear, so the <i>clear</i> action is redundant. Message processing stops. </p>
<p> These two examples show the flow of the UI state change messages. When somebody wants to suggest a change to the UI state, they send themselves a <code>WM_<wbr>CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</wbr></code> message with a description of what they want to change. The above algorithm then kicks in to decide whether the change is meaningful, and if so, it notifies all the other windows in the hierarchy about the new state. </p>
<p> <!-- forwardref: --> Next time, we'll look at how this whole indicator state thing gets off the ground. </p>

		<p>I don&#39;t know off-hand how I could make it simpler but given that even you&#39;re confused by it I&#39;d say it&#39;s pretty obvious the design is not as good as it could be.</p>

		<p>I remember physics in college (3rd year physics IIRC) we had a prof who allowed one side of one sheet. This being the very early 90&#39;s before printers that did anything better than 300 DPI, I took 4 sheets of paper and wrote all my notes in not small, but not large either, handwriting. I then went to the library and used the photocopier to reduce by 50% each sheet, cut and paste the copies together, then photocopy again to a single piece of paper.</p>
<p>I had the cheat sheet with the most information, and the only complaint was against the inclusion of a diagram showing electron-volt levels, which he tore off the corner of my paper. (He wasn&#39;t clear that only formulas and/or text were allowed, I wasn&#39;t the only one with a diagram drawn).</p>
<p>Today, I would create it electronically, of course.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: We had a history test one time where the teacher let us use a single index card worth of notes.</p>
<p>Most students tried to cram as many highlights and key points in as possible. But one guy had a different idea. &nbsp;He was able to transcribe the entire chapter onto the card&#8230; in Japanese. &nbsp;Asian scripts are *ridiculously* compact.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
