<p>Occasionally, a customer will ask, "I'm trying to display a property sheet, but when I call the <code>PropertySheet</code> function, the property sheet blinks onto the screen and then immediately disappears. What is wrong?"</p>
<p> Recall that displaying a property sheet entails filling out a <code>PROPSHEETHEADER</code> structure, which in turn contains a pointer to either an array of <code>HPROPSHEETPAGE</code>s, or more often, an array of <code>PROPSHEETPAGE</code> structures. Each <code>HPROPSHEETPAGE</code> or <code>PROPSHEETPAGE</code> structure describes one page of the property sheet. </p>
<p> When you ask for a property sheet to be displayed, the property sheet manager looks up each of the pages you specified in order to get its title, and then it starts off by displaying the page you specified in the <code>PROPSHEETHEADER.nStartPage</code> member.* </p>
<p> Of course, in order to display the page to the user, the property sheet manager needs to create the dialog whose template you specified. And that's where the property sheet can blink out of existence: If the property sheet manager tries to create the dialog corresponding to a property sheet page, but the call to <code>CreateDialog</code> fails&dagger;, then the property sheet manager deletes that page and tries the next page. Now you see how the rookie mistakes we've been looking at so far combine to form a sophomore mistake. </p>
<p> If you make a rookie mistake and either specify the wrong dialog template or fail to register all the classes that your dialog template requires, then the property sheet manager will try to create your first property sheet page and fail. "Fine, let's try the second one, then." And that fails. "How about the third one?" And that fails. Finally, the property sheet manager has tried every single page and none of them could be created. That's when it gives up and tears down the property sheet. </p>
<p> This also explains why you might see a property sheet page that disappears once you click on its tab. The same thing happened: The property sheet manager tried to create the dialog, but the <code>CreateDialog</code> failed, so it deleted that page and tried the next page. </p>
<p> This is what often gets mistaken for psychic debugging. You just explore the space logically, consider at each step what could go wrong, and from that list of possible mistakes, choose the one that sounds the most likely. If you just jump directly to your conclusion, people will think you're psychic. </p>
<p> "I call <code>PropertySheet</code> and the property sheet appears on the screen for a split second, and then vanishes. What am I doing wrong?" </p>
<p> "My psychic powers tell me that you forgot to call <code>InitCommonControlsEx</code>." </p>
<p> "Wow, that's amazing! How did you know that?" </p>
<p> Sherlock Holmes used the same technique to draw startling conclusions in many of Arthur Conan Doyle's stories. Each step in the chain of reasoning was relatively simple and straightforward, but by chaining them together and announcing the conclusion directly, people will think you're psychic. </p>
<p> <b>Nitpicker's corner</b> </p>
<p> *You can override the title by setting the <code>PSP_USETITLE</code> flag and putting the custom title into the <code>pszTitle</code> member, and you can use the <code>PSP_USEPSTARTPAGE</code> flag to switch to using the <code>PROPSHEETHEADER.pStartPage</code> member to specify the starting page. </p>
<p> &dagger;Actually, it's <code>CreateDialogParam</code> since the <code>lParam</code> of the <code>WM_INITDIALOG</code> message points to a property sheet page structure.&Dagger; </p>
<p> &Dagger;Nitpicking a nitpick, if you use <code>PSP_DLGINDIRECT</code>, then the function to create the dialog is naturally <code>CreateDialogIndirectParam</code>. </p>

		<p>I have a psychic debugging question for you. Sometimes (maybe 25% of the time) my computer becomes non-responsive when I switch users on XP. The monitor loses its connection and goes into power save mode, the keyboard and mouse still have power (light up) but do not respond &#8212; for example the caps lock key does not toggle the light on the keyboard. I have to cold boot my computer. Any psychic debugging ideas?</p>
<p>Also, this may be related, when I try to use the guest account explorer never runs.</p>
<p>Hosed XP installation? Driver issue? Any ideas?</p>

		<p>Roger Wilco &#8211; this is off-topic, so I&#8217;ll be brief. &nbsp;If networking is still fine, the chances are it&#8217;s Winlogon/terminal services failing; if networking stops, it&#8217;s probably something kernel-side.</p>
<p>Since Win32k will have to reconnect your session to the console keyboard, video and mouse, you&#8217;re probably better off posting this to someone with extensive knowledge of such drivers.</p>
<p>Alternatively, get a firewire cable and hook up a kernel debugger with a good internet connection &#8211; you can learn a lot by stepping through Winlogon&#8217;s calls before the crash. &nbsp;For the explorer failure, trace from userinit.exe.</p>

		<p>I ran into a similar problem when working on a wizard for Windows Vista. When launching the app, the wizard would briefly appear and then disappeared from the screen.</p>
<p>It turned out the associated MUI file (the separate resource file in Vista) wasn&#8217;t in the right directory. Windows would try to load the program but it would fail because it couldn&#8217;t find the resources.</p>

		<p>I read this the other day and it really struck me as odd. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the property sheet manager tries to create the dialog corresponding to a property sheet page, but the call to CreateDialog fails†, then the property sheet manager deletes that page and tries the next page.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why on earth does the property sheet manager do that? &nbsp;That seems like the worst possible thing to do. &nbsp;Would it not be way smarter to simply fail with a reasonable error than cycle through property pages looking for something that works? &nbsp;That way I might not need psychic debugging. &nbsp;Isn&#8217;t it always better to fail early than fail late?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Imagine what the world would be like if that were the case. (Hint: Shell extensions.)&#8221;</p>
<p>I see where you&#8217;re coming from but that doesn&#8217;t completely invalidate my point. &nbsp;A buggy shell extension could keep property pages in explorer from showing up at all but then a buggy shell extension could do a lot worse anyway. &nbsp;At least if it simply fails, the buggy extension might get fixed. &nbsp;Instead this weird behavior becomes part of the API. </p>
<p>The Windows API is extremely forgiving of problems in applications. &nbsp;It seems like a case of short-term gain for long-term problems to me.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>The buggy shell extension isn&#8217;t doing this on purpose. Perhaps the uninstaller ran into a problem and deleted the resource DLL but forgot to delete the registration. Now the user can&#8217;t open any property sheets. Assuming the user even knows what vendor&#8217;s shell extension&#8217;s uninstaller messed up, it was probably a non-reproducible fluke (file in use, power loss at a bad time), which makes a fix less likely. Or worse, it was an overly aggressive virus checker that deleted it. Result: &#8220;Windows is a piece of crap. I can&#8217;t open any property sheets any more, and reinstalling doesn&#8217;t help. I should have bought a Mac.&#8221; If a page can&#8217;t be created, would you prefer that the property sheet spontaneously dismiss itself and return an error? What should Explorer do if it gets such an error? Tell the user, &#8220;Sorry, you lose&#8221;? -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>&quot;Perhaps the uninstaller ran into a problem and deleted the resource DLL but forgot to delete the registration.&quot;</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t that be caught somewhere else entirely as opposed to the property sheet manager? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I fully understand your position. &nbsp;The solution provided is good for the user: they can see their property sheets even if everything else has gone wrong and nothing has trapped the problem until just that moment. &nbsp;But that solution is terrible for developers. &nbsp;Isn&#8217;t catching the problem where it occurs is better for everyone than simply ignoring the problem at the lowest level?</p>
<p>&quot;Assuming the user even knows what vendor&#8217;s shell extension&#8217;s uninstaller messed up&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, they&#8217;ll never know. &nbsp;Windows will never know. &nbsp;The shell extension registration will stay in the registry forever. &nbsp;The property sheet manager will try and load that property sheet every time for years and years and fail every time. &nbsp;And ultimately thats the reason some people have to reinstall Windows every few years.</p>

		<p>Surely Windows could identify the faulting shell extension, look it up on the internet, email the author, inform him or her of the error, help with the debugging process, receive the fixed build and install it?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
