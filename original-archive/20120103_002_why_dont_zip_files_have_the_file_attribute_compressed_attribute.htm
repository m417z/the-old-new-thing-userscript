<p>A customer reported that when they called <code>Get&shy;File&shy;Attributes</code> on a ZIP file, the <code>FILE_<wbr>ATTRIBUTE_<wbr>COMPRESSED</wbr></wbr></code> attribute was not returned. But ZIP files are compressed. Why isn't the  <code>FILE_<wbr>ATTRIBUTE_<wbr>COMPRESSED</wbr></wbr></code> attribute being set?</p>
<p> Because <code>FILE_<wbr>ATTRIBUTE_<wbr>COMPRESSED</wbr></wbr></code> tells you whether the file was compressed <i>by the file system</i>. It is not a flag which describes the semantics of the bytes stored in the file. After all, the file system doesn't know that this particular collection of bytes is a ZIP file and contains data that was compressed externally. Who knows, maybe it's just some uncompressed file that just happens to look superficially like a ZIP file (but isn't)? </p>
<p> If a text file consists of the string "ADTUR ADKUH", is this a compressed file? Maybe it's somebody's product key, in which it isn't compressed. Or maybe it is short for "<a href="http://hem.passagen.se/tan01/code.html">Await instructions before taking further action. Acknowledge receipt of this telegram by wire</a>." That's an example of a commercial code, used to save telegram transmission costs by compressing frequently-used business phrases into five-letter pseudo-words. </p>
<p> The file system doesn't try to figure out whether a particular sequence of bytes it has been asked to store was externally compressed. It just stores the bytes on disk, perhaps after performing its own internal compression, and if that internal compression was performed (even if it didn't actually result in any compression), the <code>FILE_<wbr>ATTRIBUTE_<wbr>COMPRESSED</wbr></wbr></code> attribute is set. </p>
<p> Similarly, the <code>FILE_<wbr>ATTRIBUTE_<wbr>ENCRYPTED</wbr></wbr></code> attribute is set if the file contents were encrypted by the file system. If encryption took place externally, then the attribute is not set because the file system doesn't know that the byte sequence it was asked to store represented encrypted data. </p>
<p> (Note that many special-purpose file formats, such as DOCX, JAR, JPG, and PNG, are internally compressed, even though they are not advertised as such.) </p>

		<p>DOCX, JAR, and recent FLA (Flash development) files are all zip files in disguise, with extra constraints regarding their semantics (i.e. not every zip file is a valid DOCX, JAR, or FLA). &nbsp;Older FLA files were just binary blobs with their own special file format before Adobe moved to zip archives (in CS5 I think?).</p>
<p>The neat thing about zip files is that the file format only requires the directory to be at the end of the file, not the beginning, so you can stuff arbitrary bytes at the front of a zip and it&#39;ll still be a valid zip. &nbsp;This allows for tricks like this: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://gayhacker.wordpress.com/2009/04/03/well-well-well/" rel="nofollow">gayhacker.wordpress.com/&#8230;/well-well-well</a> .</p>

		<p>Of course, you could store a Zip file (which is compressed) in an NTFS compressed directory (or just tell NTFS to compress the file). &nbsp;It probably won&#39;t take fewer bytes on disk, but the compressed attribute will get set!</p>

		<p>ZIP files don&#39;t necessarily use compression, anyway. &nbsp;One of the defined compression methods is &#39;store&#39;, which just puts the file&#39;s bytes in the archive without compression.</p>

		<p>@Adam Rosenfield: ZIP is even trickier than that &#8211; it can contain arbitrary data at the end as well, as the last field of the central directory is a general purpose &quot;comment&quot; field. The only limitation is that the extra data cannot be bigger than 64K since the length of the comment field is stored on two bytes.</p>
<p>This means that the only foolproof way to open a ZIP file is to start at the end, and keep scanning backwards for a 4-byte magic number in the central directory. You can only safely reject a file after scanning its last 64 kilobytes. I only know because I had to deal with these edge cases, and the default ZIP handling code in Java gets it wrong&#8230;</p>

		<p>There&#39;s an &quot;Index&quot; attribute that probably only the legacy Indexing Service looked at. But it&#39;s text has changed in modern Windows to &quot;Allow this file to have contents indexed in addition to file properties.&quot; Does this mean indexed by Windows Search or still the legacy indexer?</p>

		<p>@Ben Voigt: It&#39;s also useful for creating digitally signed self-extracting archives. The executable headers and the unpacker code will appear as an &quot;arbitrary&quot; prefix, and the digital signature will appear as an &quot;arbitrary&quot; suffix, but a well-written ZIP library can still extract files from it normally, without having to execute it.</p>

		<p>If Microsoft ever manages to get time travel working (come on already, Microsoft Research! :-) ), I wouldn&#39;t mind FILE_ATTRIBUTE_THE_ONE_YOU_ARE_LOOKING_FOR. It would simplify my programs ever so much, removing the need for those pesky Open and Save As dialog boxes!</p>

		<p>Don&#39;t forget the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SHARKS attribute, which is used to indicate that a file contains shark-related information. Later versions can add FILE_ATTRIBUTE_URCHIN of course, but since I would gain more from the SHARKS attribute clearly it should be added first.</p>

		<p>Clearly there would be no problem if Windows supported FILE_ATTRIBUTE_THIS_IS_A_ZIP_FILE. We also need to be able to flag important files with FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NOCORRUPT and frequently-used executables with FILE_ATTRIBUTE_GO_FASTER.</p>
<p>Pro tip: If the search function can&#39;t find a file that you know is right there, and you are not content it got indexed, simply flag the file with FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NOT_CONTENT_INDEXED.</p>
<p>Money-saving tip: You may be able to find that cordless mouse you used to have, as they often build a &quot;human-interface device den&quot; to live in. These can be found by searching for FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN.</p>

		<p>Index is a flag which suggest that indexing programs shouldn&#39;t index the file. As the Archive flag suggest that backup program shouldn&#39;t backup the file.</p>
<p>What these programs actually do is up to the programs and their users. As a rule of thumb, MS own programs usually doesn&#39;t obey MS own rules.</p>

		<p>DWalker: The index attribute doesn&#39;t know who is going to index the file any more than the &quot;archive&quot; attribute knows who archives files. It&#39;s just an attribute to be used by any content indexing system that wants to know what files are(n&#39;t) worth indexing. No doubt it&#39;s used by both the old Windows Indexing and new Windows Search, along with other things like Google Desktop.</p>

		<p>Gabe, you&#39;re probably right, but I suspect that Google Desktop Search (and probably other non-MS programs) don&#39;t use that flag at all.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
