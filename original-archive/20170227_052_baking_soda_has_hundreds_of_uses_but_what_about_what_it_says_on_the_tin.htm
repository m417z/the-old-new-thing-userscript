My mother bought a giant bag of baking soda
in order to deodorize some carpet.
She had some left over and wondered if it was food grade.
The bag said,
"Hundreds of uses!"
and listed all sorts of uses for baking soda.
"Baking" was not on the list.
</p>
<p>
<b>Follow-up</b>:
She called the manufacturer.
It is safe for baking, too.</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>Congratulations on this &#8211; your 5000th blog post.</p>
<p>Some stats:<br />
1st Post: Monday July 21, 2003<br />
Number of consecutive weekdays with blog entry posted: 3550<br />
Number of posts: 5000<br />
Average posts per weekday: 1.408</p>
<p>In all this time, you&#8217;ve been not only a key software developer at Microsoft, but also a senior executive and public relations rep (<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140909-00/?p=44123/" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140909-00/?p=44123/</a>)</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t looked it up to be sure, but you must be the most prolific blogger at Microsoft.</p>

		<p>My memory may be faulty here, but ISTR that Raymond&#8217;s blog was on some other domain at first, along with other Microsoft bloggers, and that there were some posts from that site that got lost in one of the migrations. The scrollbar series starts at part 2, which suggests that there&#8217;s a missing part 1. <a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing" rel="nofollow">https://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing</a> is in the Wayback Machine, but that also starts on 2003-07-21.</p>

		<p>I remembered the original site: <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc</a>. The Wayback Machine archive of that one also shows that the first post was on 2003-07-21, so it looks like I was indeed misremembering history.</p>

		<p>Raymond may not truly be a &#8220;senior executive&#8221;, but he has done more than anyone else to shape my (mostly positive) ideas about Microsoft&#8217;s engineering.  I have learned a LOT from this blog over the last 13 years.</p>

		<p>We used to mix it in with the cattle feed.  Used a 50lb bag a day.  I think a 50lb bag of agricultural grade cost about the same as a little box at the grocery store.</p>

		<p>Dishwasher salt is a similar conundrum. Search for whether it&#8217;s safe to eat and people will list all of the horrible chemicals used in it, but if you google those chemicals with &#8220;table salt&#8221; then you find hits on those too.</p>

		<p>Generally the difference is whether the manufacturing is guaranteed food safe or not. It can be for hygienic reasons, or there may be trace amounts of solvents or other such byproducts left in the non food safe version.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve used baking soda several times when baking waffles from raw ingredients (i.e., not from a waffle mix).  I did not call the manufacturer about it.  If you look at the ingredients list for most prepared waffle/pancake mixes, you&#8217;ll see baking soda or sodium bicarbonate listed in it.</p>

		<p>I think the concern was not that baking soda in general is unsafe for consumption, but rather she purchased some sort of bulk package of baking soda and it wasn&#8217;t clear from the packaging that the manufacturing, packaging and handling process was done in a food-safe manner.  (i.e. you can buy industrial dry ice for less expensive than food grade dry ice, but you shouldn&#8217;t use it to carbonate your root beer).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
