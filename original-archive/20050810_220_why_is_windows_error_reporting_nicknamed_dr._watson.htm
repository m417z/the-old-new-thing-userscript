<p>The nickname for the feature known as Windows Error Reporting is "Dr. Watson". Where did that name come from?</p>
<p> As you have probably guessed, The name Dr.&nbsp;Watson was inspired by <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~exlibris/watson.html"> the character of Dr.&nbsp;Watson</a>, the assistant to <a href="http://www.sherlock-holmes.co.uk/"> Sherlock Holmes</a> in the stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. </p>
<p> It is my understanding that the doctor was originally developed as part of Windows&nbsp;3.0 beta testing. His job was to record data about application crashes to a file, so that the file could be uploaded and included with bug reports. The icon was (and continues to be) a friendly doctor using his stethoscope to investigate a problem. </p>
<p> The Doctor has remained true to the "capture information about an error" aspect of his job. In the meantime, the word "Watson" has expanded its meaning to encompass <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikekelly/archive/2005/02/03/366861.aspx"> anonymous end-user feedback mechanisms in general, such as "Content Watson"</a>. (But if you hear "Watson" by itself, the speaker is almost certainly talking about error reporting.) </p>

		<p>Since I work at a Med-Tech company there&#8217;s bound to be one at least slightly eccentric MD in the close proximity. Ours is Dr Rosen. So when my colleagues designed an error reporting module for the device we make, it was called Dr Rosen in tribute to him and Dr Watson.<br />
<br />At least I find that funny, but then I know Dr Rosen&#8230;</p>

		<p>dr watson would be good for remote crash debugging if it wasn&#8217;t so&#8230; well basically useless most of the time.</p>
<p>most Dr&#8217;s reports from MSVC release (optimized) code come with the warning &quot;WARNING: Stack unwind information not available. Following frames may be wrong&quot;, and indeed most of the time they are and you can&#8217;t figure out where the crash occured</p>
<p>i hope somebody from MS is listening so that they can at least add version information (from the apps resources) or at least the executable modification date so we can know which version of the program crashed?</p>
<p>thanks for listening :)</p>

		<p>nikos: The crash dump contains information even more reliable than the file version resource (people often forget to update that) and the last-modified date (which can be altered) &#8211; it contains the file header timestamp. Use that to index your symbol files. That&#8217;s how the Symbol Server works.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  it contains the file header timestamp</p>
<p>i examined a few logs my users have sent me (all from w2000 unfortunately) but i can&#8217;t find any sort of timestamp info except for the time of the crash</p>
<p>perhaps what you are refering to is XP-only, and where can it be found?</p>

		<p>What annoyed me about Dr Watson is that Win 95/98/Me produced .wlg files which could not be read by Dr Watson on Win 2000/XP/2003. The file format was not documented as well which didn&#8217;t allow people to produce their own readers either.</p>

		<p>Though it has got the conspiracy theorists going crazy about how your personal information, credit card number and house key are sent to Microsoft during error reporting, I don&#8217;t care because those who designed it have done a superb job. Nowadays, nearly each time I send an error report I get a solution in return. Kudos to them, however little you appreciate Microsoft (or Micro$oft, is that right?).</p>

		<p>nikos, Dr. Watson not only writes a log file but it can also create a crash dump. By default it&#8217;s configured to do both. The amount of information written in the dump will depend of which crash options are selected.</p>
<p>The reason for the &quot;information not available&quot; error is because there&#8217;s no symbols installed on the system. It&#8217;s not feasible to ask customers to install symbols. As a developer you should be in the habit of requesting crash dumps.</p>
<p>Once you have the crash dump then load it in a debugger such as WinDbg. Using either the !dh or !lmi commands you can access the information Raymond mentioned. Use the lmv command if you wish to access version information.</p>
<p>Dr. Watson logs are great because they&#8217;re cumulative and they keep a history but they&#8217;re no replacement for a crash dump.</p>

		<p>Actually, the nickname is supposed to be just &quot;Watson&quot; (without the &quot;Dr.&quot;).  Unfortunately, everyone added &quot;Dr.&quot; because they assumed it was either the next version of or somehow associated with the default JIT debugger which still exists and is still called &quot;Dr. Watson&quot; and because the name for the reporting app itself is &quot;DW&quot; and people incorrectly assume that the D stands for &quot;Dr.&quot;</p>

		<p>The old Dr. Watson and the newer DW are actually named differently.  DW was supposed to stand for &quot;Dad Watson.&quot; DAD was the acronym for Desktop Applications Division, which was the old name for the team that made Office.</p>
<p>The Office guys wanted to differentiated their new Watson that used the internet to upload stuff with the older Win 3x Dr. Watson so they called it Dad Watson.  Ultimately it was abbreviated DW and Windows also picked up the functionality so the old Dr. Watson got grandfathered in.</p>

		<p>If you save your PDB files for each build and Dr. Watson uses the minidump file format, you can load a crash in .NET and see everything.  It is really nice.</p>
<p>About half the crash dumps we received using the minidump system showed us exactly where the crash happened.  The other half of the time, the PC was off in the weeds.</p>

		<p>of course the best scenario is a user that has visual studio, where you can just send him the PDB and get back the stack trace :)</p>

		<p>I always thought that in addition to the Holmes reference, it tied in nicely w/ the story about Bell &amp; his first phone call: Watson, come here! I need you!</p>

<br />&gt; If you save your PDB files for each build<br />
<br />&gt; and Dr. Watson uses the minidump file<br />
<br />&gt; format, you can load a crash in .NET and see<br />
<br />&gt; everything. It is really nice.</p>
<p>Yeah I thought I had read something like that before.  But when cmd.exe aborted and I tried to open its minidump in .Net, .Net didn&#8217;t show anything.  When I closed .Net, .Net aborted.  Then I was offered an opportunity to debug .Net using a new invocation of .Net, which I declined.</p>

		<p>Actually, Chris is nearly correct when he points out that</p>
<p>&quot;The old Dr. Watson and the newer DW are actually named differently. DW was supposed to stand for &quot;Dad Watson.&quot; DAD was the acronym for Desktop Applications Division, which was the old name for the team that made Office.&quot;</p>
<p>The DAD devs liked to frequent &quot;Dad Watsons&quot;, a pub on Fremont Ave and 36th, which is where DAD Watson (dw.exe) got its Nickname.<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
