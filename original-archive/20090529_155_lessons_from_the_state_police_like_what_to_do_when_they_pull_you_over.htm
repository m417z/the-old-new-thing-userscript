		<p>I would have thought they would touch the car to discharge static electricity build-up. Apparently it&#8217;s just to leave evidence.</p>

		<p>They&#8217;re prone to hallucinations, and they want to make sure your vehicle is real before they go through the effort of running the license.</p>
<p>Or I could read the link, I guess&#8230;</p>

		<p>Not a lot of there there. For all the work involved in listening to it, there is very little information.</p>
<p>&quot;what you should do when you are pulled over&quot;</p>
<p>Keep your hands on the steering wheel.</p>
<p>&quot;why the first thing the officer does is touch your car&quot;</p>
<p>To leave evidence in case things &quot;go bad&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Weirdo: your IP address has been recorded, and the authorities have been alerted. When the feds pull over your very clean car, make sure to keep your hands on the steering wheel.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately when I was pulled over and tried to leave my handprint on the police car (just in case&#8230;), I was tasered.</p>
<p>Apparently, what&#8217;s good for the goose isn&#8217;t good for the gander in this case. &nbsp;Or maybe he was upset that I had taken my hands off the steering wheel (and gotten out of the car).</p>

		<p>When I was 18 I and in the US &#8211; Dallas/Ft.Worth &#8211; for a month, I did a ride-along with the DPD. One of the most memorable and fun experiences of my life. Did a high speed chase, took a couple of people to jail, helped some old folks, &#8230;</p>
<p>If you ever have the chance to do this, don&#8217;t hesitate.</p>

		<p>Here in the UK, I&#8217;ve always been advised to step out of the car to greet the police, as it&#8217;s more &quot;friendly&quot; than staying in the car to make them come over.</p>

		<p>@Shaun: ditto&#8230; although i think it&#8217;s because over there they have guns everywhere which makes it much more dangerous</p>
<p>over there the priority is to keep an eye on your hands so they have some warning if you pull out a gun and shoot them, whereas over here the priority is to get you out of the car so you don&#8217;t drive off</p>

		<p>What if your steering wheel is actually a detachable concealed weapon? Is it ok to keep hands on it?</p>

		<p>@Igor Levicki: I think that if your steering wheel is detachable concealed weapon, you usually have a license to kill, a secret agent badge, and missiles mounted under the head lights. In that case just report the incident to M and apologize &nbsp;to Q for blowing up hes latest car.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
