<p>My random walk began at <a href="http://www.svd.se/">Svenska Dagbladet</a> and the article <a href="http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_9179146.asp"> Svensk designer uppr&ouml;r skottar</a>, about Swedish designer Johanna Larson whose T-shirt depicting the traffic-cone-wearing Duke of Wellington has sparked a debate in the city.</p>
<p> The article mentions that the tradition of placing a traffic cone on the head of the Duke is twenty years old, and my search for further information on this ongoing prank led me to <a href="http://www.leyton.org/"> Richard Leyton</a>'s musings on <a href="http://www.leyton.org/archives/2005/01/a_permanent_cone_for_wellington.html"> whether the traffic cone should be glued in place permanently</a>. </p>
<p> At the end of his entry, he links to the wonderful web site of <a href="http://www.houseoftheorangemonkey.co.uk/"> Mr Monkey</a> and in particular <a href="http://www.houseoftheorangemonkey.co.uk/monkey/trips/trip1305.htm"> Mr Monkey's visit to the statue to see it for himself</a>. </p>
<p> The Mr Monkey web site is one of the hidden treasures of the Internet. Sure, it may not be entirely original, but Mr Monkey himself is so goofy-looking, the pictures are for the most part quite well-composed, and the subtitles are the icing on the cake. </p>

		<p>There is something similar in Cambridge.  (The original, not the imposter near Boston).  In the middle of one of the commons (green parks) very close to the centre of town, there is a lampost.  On the base someone painted graffiti &quot;Reality Checkpoint&quot;.  It always seems so perfect and has become the informal name for it.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s also the chronic &quot;Surrender Dorothy&quot; over the Capital Beltway near Washington DC with the Mormon temple rising in the background.</p>

		<p>Reality checkpoint is apt.</p>
<p>When you cycle across Parker&#8217;s Piece at night in the mist, you have the sensation that you are not moving. When you reach the lamp post you have a brief glimpse of reality i.e. that you are moving.<br /></p>

		<p>Hmm&#8230; Duke and traffic cone&#8230; I guess you revealed the secret of Java Duke:<br />

		<p>Well I suppose putting the cone on &quot;The Duke&quot; is higher brow than the frat prank at my school.  Here they put a jock strap on the statue out side the Rec center.  I suppose now would be a good time to point out that the name of the school A cappella choir is &quot;Bare Naked Statues&quot; (<a target="_new" href="http://www.barenakedstatues.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.barenakedstatues.com/</a>) for a reason  (Obviously named after the numorous statues on campus.)</p>
<p>(And in case you&#8217;re wondering, the Blue Shirts they wear are the Facilities Services Uniforms.  Facilities maintains the statues after all.)</p>

		<p>The Cambridge &#8216;Reality Checkpoint&#8217; has an underground meaning too: On one side of parker&#8217;s Piece, you have the town center, with all the universities and students. On the other side, so after the Reality Checkpoint, it is the real Cambridge, where people actually live and work. So called &#8216;real people&#8217; of Cambridge, i.e. not students like to think that their Cambridge is on this side of the town. The term has been rewritten after each painting of the lamp post, and is now carved into the metal.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
