<p>Josh points out that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/06/24/8644367.aspx#8647383"> Group Policy settings often employ double-negatives</a> (and what's the difference between turning something off and not configuring it)?</p>
<p> Group Policy settings are unusual in that they are there to modify behavior that would continue to exist without them. They aren't part of the behavior but rather a follow-on. Suppose that the default behavior is to <i>do XYZ automatically</i>, but due to requests from corporate customers, a Group Policy is added to alter this behavior. The Group Policy for this might look like this: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  Don't do XYZ automatically </p>
<p> <input type="radio" name="XYZ" id="XYZ_E"><label for="XYZ_E">Enabled</label><br> <input type="radio" name="XYZ" id="XYZ_D"><label for="XYZ_D">Disabled</label><br> <input type="radio" name="XYZ" id="XYZ_N"><label for="XYZ_N">Not configured</label><br> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The template for boolean Group Policy settings is </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  Blah blah blah </p>
<p> <input type="radio" name="XYZ" id="XYZ_E2"><label for="XYZ_E2">Enabled</label><br> <input type="radio" name="XYZ" id="XYZ_D2"><label for="XYZ_D2">Disabled</label><br> <input type="radio" name="XYZ" id="XYZ_N2"><label for="XYZ_N2">Not configured</label><br> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Consequently, every boolean Group Policy setting is forced into the above format, even if the setting is reverse-sense, as our sample one is. In general, the three settings for a Group Policy mean </p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td>Enabled</td>
<td>Change the behavior as described in the title of the group policy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disabled</td>
<td>Do not change the behavior and continue with the default behavior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not configured</td>
<td>Let somebody else decide.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> The difference between <i>Disabled</i> and <i>Not configured</i> is that when you disable a Group Policy, then you're saying "Restore default behavior." On the other hand, if you don't configure a Group Policy setting, then you're saying "I have no opinion about whether this Group Policy should be enabled or disabled, so keep looking, because there might be another Group Policy Object that does express an opinion." </p>
<p> Recall that multiple Group Policy Objects can apply to a specific user. For example, a typical user may be subject to a Local Group Policy, a Non-Administrator Local Group Policy, a series of other Group Policies depending on what security groups the user belongs to, and then a User-Specified Group Policy. You can use the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/cc758010.aspx"> Resultant Set of Policy</a> snap-in to see how all these different Group Policy Objects interact. </p>
<p> The upshot of this is that Group Policy settings often end up using double negatives if the policy is to disable a default behavior. You "Enable" the setting to disable the default behavior, you "Disable" the setting to enable the default behavior, and you leave the setting "Not configured" if you want to let some other Group Policy Object decide. Even when <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/01/25/10119675.aspx#10120130"> there is a more clever way of wording the options</a> to avoid the double negative, the people who write Group Policy descriptions are so used to double-negatives that it doesn't even occur to them that a particular setting setting permits an optimization. (Either that, or they figure that system administrators are so used to seeing double-negatives, that when it's not there, they get confused!) </p>

		<p>They&#39;re just all electronics engeneers. Those are used to double negatives as (in the old days, I have not kept up I guess its still true in hardware ports) a nand/nor port was cheaper and faster than an and/or port.</p>

		<p>@gedoe Yeah. Also pretty often IOBs or reset signals where a logical true is often represented as a 0.. I&#39;m sure quite confusing for the first time, but alas you get used to it.</p>

		<p>As alt-92_ points out, RSOP was deprecated (because Microsoft became lazy) in Vista SP1. Now we have to use gpresult. Why are we going back from the GUI to command line, MS needs to un-deprecate it and make it show the full set of configured policies. Also, filtering policies in Group Policy to show those that apply only to a specific product is gone in Windows 7. I can only filter &quot;any&quot; or &quot;all&quot;, not &quot;only&quot;.</p>

		<p>@von: worse yet are active low flags in software that don&#39;t have anything to do with hardware. Complete with &#39;n&#39; prefix in the name. So you have to set them to FALSE to enable them.</p>
<p>At least active low signals make a lot of sense electrically (NMOS transistor driving it low which can be made extremely powerful for their size (PMOS are bigger), so signals with large fanouts can have smaller output transistors. Also why you see more open-drain outputs with pullup resistors than open-source with pulldowns. Finally, ground is usually a huge power rail while Vcc isn&#39;t, so it&#39;s far easier to pull down to ground and not worry about noise or buffers if the ground bounces a bit than pull up and pull the Vcc rail below operating threshold.</p>
<p>And yes, NAND/NOR are faster gates &#8211; CMOS does inversion by default, each input consumes two transistors &#8211; an NMOS and a PMOS. AND/ORs add an extra inverter and thus have more gate delay. Plus NAND/NOR are fully describable -you can implement any logic circuit with just NAND or just NOR gates.</p>

		<p>Not forgetting TTL which also had inversion by default, and open collector (analogous to open drain). I think they mostly came in NPN types for similar reasons.</p>

		<p>@ Troll: I&#39;ll bite ..</p>
<p>RSoP.msc is deprecated because it doesn&#39;t work with GP Preferences (at all), gave you questionable info and is completely non-interactive. &nbsp;Gpresult.exe since NT6x is much more refined, exports better and reports (both HTML and XML) are easy to read and really shows all applied policies including Preferences &#8211; and if there are no adm(x), it&#39;ll present the registry locations.</p>
<p>Filtering in gpedit.msc works just fine. You&#39;re doing it wrong :P</p>

		<p>Why does the resolution of GetTickCount() vary between 15 and 16ms? Is it a rounding issue?</p>
<p>Also, is there any reason why the resolution hasn&#39;t been selected as 1ms as in other operating systems running on the same system architecture? (not trolling, honest!)</p>

		<p>@alt-92_, well then it is their job to *make it work* with GP Preferences instead of abandoning a perfectly good MMC snap-in. And filtering doesn&#39;t work as I want in Windows 7 GPO. Let&#39;s say I want to only view policies that apply to Vista, not Windows 7, not XP because for those OSes, I have a different set of policies that I want to enforce. Without the &quot;only&quot; option, I can only see ones that apply to &quot;all&quot; or &quot;any&quot; which is not what I want. Of course, alternatively, one can do it using WMI filters in GMPC.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
