		<p>The 1994 Northridge earthquake was predicted by Damocles in the movie Dr. Strangelove which is a double negative according to a Flight attendant out of Flint, Michigan named Marv Albert who&#8217;s favorite poem was The Rime of the Ancient Mariner?</p>

		<p>The Simpsons?</p>
<p>Marv Albert was a guest star; the earthquake stopped production on the show; Flint, Michigan is mentioned in one episode&#8230; There&#8217;s a reference to the Sword of Damocles in &quot;Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk&quot;, Dr. Strangelove in &quot;Homer the Vigilante&quot;, and the Rime of the Ancient Mariner in &quot;Boy-Scoutz N the Hood&quot;.</p>

		<p>Actually &#8211; they all refer to the Simpsons, except for &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; with which you need to go to the linked article &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner in popular culture&quot; to read about the Simpsons reference. :)</p>

		<p>It appears to be The Simpsons &#8211; unfortunately, since Raymond compiled the list, somebody has split the &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner in popular culture&quot; section off onto its own page, as Yoni points out.</p>
<p>This implies that Raymond compiled the list sometime before 10:14 UTC on 7 August this year:</p>

		<p>The Simpsons has been running for (seemingly) 60 years at this point&#8230; it would be hard to compose a list completely unrelated to the content of the show.</p>
<p>That said, it seems like that&#8217;s the most likely answer. I dunno.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not that they&#8217;ve all been featured in/mentioned in/connected to The Simpsons. It&#8217;s that they have (or at least at the time of posting had) one of those ridiculous &#8220;In Popular Culture&#8221; sections, listing mentions in Simpsons episodes, that get Wikipedia a bad name.</p>

		<p>&quot;What exactly is the downside of wikipedia articles having an &quot;In Popular Culture&quot; section?&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s juvenile and ultimately pointless?</p>
<p>The ones which annoy me are the ones where the topic is mentioned in passing in the lyrics of a song written by some band I&#8217;ve never heard of. Not exactly &quot;popular&quot; culture&#8230;</p>

		<p>I believe that the &quot;downside&quot; is that popular culture references everything under the sun and does so on numerous occasions. &nbsp;That information adds no value to the article and seems to be nothing more than a form of petty one-upmanship for Wikipedians.</p>
<p>It falls under the umbrella of &quot;trivia&quot; &#8211; superficial information typically volunteered by people who really want to contribute to a discussion but don&#8217;t actually have anything to contribute by way of understanding the subject matter. &nbsp;These are generally the people whom I want to punch in the face when cornered into a conversation with them (but I&#8217;ll note for the record that I&#8217;ve never actually done so, it&#8217;s just an urge).</p>

<p>&quot;Someday the &#8216;in popular culture&#8217; section will have its own article with an &#8216;in popular culture&#8217; section. It will reference this title-text reference it, and the blogosphere will implode.&quot;</p>
<p>Amusingly, the &quot;wood&quot; page (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood for those who care) on wikipedia had its &#8216;in popular culture&#8217; section added after that cartoon was posted, and shortly afterwards it was deleted again because openly mocking wikipedia is, apparantly, against the rules.</p>

		<p>Raymond Chen: In popular culture:</p>
<p>Raymond is characterized in the video game &#8216;Fallout 3&#8217; (Bethesda Softwarks, 2008), in which he can be found in the center of the town of &#8216;Megaton&#8217;.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;d rather Wikipedia didn&#8217;t have so much material from fictional worlds; instead leaving that up to fan-run wikis.</p>
<p>But then some people would start trying to exclude religious subjects as &#8216;fiction&#8217;, and articles about evolution, global warming, and on and on.</p>

		<p>Definition of Encyclopedia:</p>
<p>a book or set of books containing articles on various topics, usually in alphabetical arrangement, covering all branches of knowledge or, less commonly, all aspects of one subject</p>
<p>Definition of Knowledge:</p>
<p>something that is or may be known; information</p>
<p>&#8220;In Popular Culture&#8221; sections are information and as such they are knowledge. &nbsp;Since Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia covering all branches of knowledge (instead of a particular subject matter), I can think of no better place for &#8220;In Popular Culture&#8221; sections than there.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Please contact the editors of the World Book Encyclopedia, telling them that they&#8217;re not an encyclopedia because they don&#8217;t have an &#8220;In Popular Culture&#8221; section for Mao Zedong. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I was banned from Wikipedia (after editing occasionally over about 3 years) because I refused to &quot;discuss&quot; a particularly silly popular culture section with an administrator who wanted to keep it.</p>

		<p>I find it amusing that the &quot;In Popular Culture&quot; section of the fake &quot;Wood&quot; article in the aforementioned xkcd strip also has a Simpson&#8217;s reference.</p>

		<p>I entirely disagree. While it&#8217;s annoying to see them, it&#8217;s a step closer enabling better searches because it links the context better. Suppose the scenario is that there&#8217;s important keyword in the article that describes it in a way that&#8217;s not described in the article of the &quot;popular culture&quot; item. Now in order to find this reference when searching, the pop item name needs to be on the same page or the search engine must be able to do depth travels and afaik no search engine does this.</p>
<p>So while I agree, they&#8217;re entirely useless and very annoying to see on the article, for the purposes of finding the &quot;original&quot; when you&#8217;ve seen something in the newer &quot;pop item&quot; it can help because the newer item can&#8217;t have all that text describing the original.</p>
<p>So until a search engine comes along that does also look all the text in the links on the page (semantic web?) these &quot;in popular culture&quot; sections actually help the current searches.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s another matter if you believe that no one should be able to find the original but I disagree. For example when listening to some newer music, I often hear something that I think has been lifted of from very old music. And in order to find that, there needs to be a place that mentions both the old and new in the same place!</p>

		<p>Well, the other correct answer to Raymond&#8217;s question is &quot;They are all linked to from The Old New Thing blog&quot;.</p>
<p>As regards the &quot;In Popular Culture&quot; thing, they&#8217;re obviously NOT entirely useless, as several posters here have said they find them useful. I myself have found them very useful on several occasions.</p>

		<p>The problem is that there is no obvious place for this information to go. TvTropes is the closest, but should really only have pages on /tropes/ (duh!), a category in which Dr. Strangelove is (sadly) not included. An explicitly popular culture wiki could be very&#8230; uh&#8230; popular. Probably not *useful*, but then neither is TvTropes, really.</p>

		<p>Raymond, that an encyclopedia can have a &quot;In Popular Culture&quot; does not entail that all encyclopedias (encyclopedium?) need to have one.</p>
<p>While some references in &quot;In Popular Culture&quot; are indeed not really popular, the probability that something will be referenced there is directly proportional to its entrenchment in the popular culture of the moments. So the Simpson, being very popular, quite long-lived and, I might add, very wide in its pop-culture references and propensity to put various winks in each episode, has a lot of references.</p>
<p>Plus, I find it interesting that the section pretty much accounts for a kind of historical trend in pop-culture. It might be trivial now, but if Wikipedia endures for, say, 100 years, that section will be interesting for social historians.</p>

		<p>It was about 2.5 years ago, I think that the newspeak edict came down from God knows where. Overnight &quot;popular culture&quot; became the new term for what had until then been labeled &quot;trivia,&quot; magically making it exempt from any criticism that it was trivia and should be removed.</p>
<p>This is how the Wikipedia hivemind thinks.</p>

		<p>The article &#8216;Popular Culture&#8217; has a section named &#8216;Popular Culture in Popular Culture&#8217;. Someone please kill me.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the &#8216;Wikipedia&#8217; article does not have a popular culture section. Instead, it has &#8216;Cultural Significance&#8217;. And a whole article dedicated to &#8216;Wikipedia in Culture&#8217;.</p>

		<p>If it is popular then it isn&#8217;t culture and vice versa.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
