<p> When two of my friends were getting married (to each other), there was of course a lot of effort spent on finding the right wedding location. To relieve the tension, when we got together, we would amuse ourselves by coming up with <i>guerilla wedding locations</i>, which was our term for surreptitiously holding a wedding ceremony at a location without the site owner's knowledge. Everybody would converge on the designated location, wait for the secret signal, and then spontaneously assemble for a wedding ceremony, wrapping it all up before anybody else knew what happened. Here are some ideas in the Seattle area we came up with: </p>
<ul>
<li>     A Seattle ferry.     (Oops,     <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/outdoors/2008883097_nwwferries19.html">     turns out this is normal</a>!) </li>
<li>A Metro express bus. </li>
<li>The     <a href="http://buckleyplanet.typepad.com/cafetour/2008/02/a-room-with-a-v.html">     top floor</a>     of     <a href="http://channel8.msdn.com/Posts/Microsoft-Facility-Sneak-Peak-Lincoln-Square/">     Lincoln Square</a>.     (Reception to be held on floor 27.)     Though apparently     <a href="http://seattlescondo.com/?p=15">     the Bravern cafeterias are even more amazing</a>. </li>
<li>The     <a href="http://www.bellevuebotanical.org/gallery/groundcover/fmgroundcover.htm">     viewing pavilion of the Groundcover Garden</a>     at     <a href="http://www.bellevuebotanical.org/">     Bellevue Botanical Garden</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p> Even now, with the wedding planning a dim memory, when we find a particularly nice location, we still find ourselves turning to each other and saying, "guerilla wedding." </p>

		<p>My wife and I were married in a Toys-R-Us, but our only audience was the preacher and the action figures. No flash mobs, I am afraid. The families got a big wedding the next year (and I ended up with two anniversaries to remember).</p>

		<p>My wife and I did this at Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery in Woodenville about 8 years ago. But we only had one guest plus two witnesses and a minister. And then we had a reception across the street at Redhook. I think our expenses were under $100 for license and dinner.</p>
<p>But nobody knew the date; so we guessed and have an off-by-one error on our certificate. We celebrate either/both days.</p>

		<p>There was a time when the Disney company did not allow weddings in their parks. People would sneak in and have a flash wedding anyway because they wanted to get married there. Eventually Disney smartened up and now hosting dream weddings is big business for them. You can even buy bride and groom Mickey ears hats in many of the stores.</p>

		<p>Funny, my fiance and I are planning to get married soon and looking at the money grab that&#8217;s built up around it and were debating Just declaring ourselves married.</p>
<p>having seen that other people have taken the guerrilla route, we may just yet.</p>

		<p>@Joe: Just declaring yourself married doesn&#8217;t make you that in the legal sense. Which may cause you some headache in legal matters depending on what laws apply where you live.</p>
<p>However if you just want to be married without the whole expensive schebang, there should be no problem finding someone (a lawman or priest or similar) that can lawfully wed you for free.</p>

		<p>Around here (Lynchburg, VA) people sometimes get married on the huge front steps of the city hall (the old part of town is built on a near-vertical hill) without warning the town&#8230; :)</p>
<p>Nice view though &#8211; old town, big river and bigger mountains spreading out at your feet.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
