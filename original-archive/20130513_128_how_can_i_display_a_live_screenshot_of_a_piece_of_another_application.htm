Today's Little Program takes a rectangular portion of another application
and continuously replicates it in its own client area.
You might want to do this if you want to monitor a portion
of an application like
a custom progress bar,
and the application doesn't use the Windows&nbsp;7 taskbar progress
indicator feature.
(Maybe it's an old application.)

<p>
Take our
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
scratch program</a>
and make the following changes:
</p>
<pre>
#define STRICT
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;windowsx.h&gt;
#include &lt;ole2.h&gt;
#include &lt;commctrl.h&gt;
#include &lt;shlwapi.h&gt;
<font COLOR=blue>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;dwmapi.h&gt;</font>

HINSTANCE g_hinst;                          /* This application's HINSTANCE */
HWND g_hwndChild;                           /* Optional child window */
<font COLOR=blue>HTHUMBNAIL g_hthumb;</font>

BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
  <font COLOR=blue>DWM_THUMBNAIL_PROPERTIES props = {};
  HWND hwndTarget;
  if (sscanf(reinterpret_cast&lt;PCSTR&gt;(lpcs-&gt;lpCreateParams),
               "%p %ld %ld %ld %ld", &amp;hwndTarget,
               &amp;props.rcSource.left, &amp;props.rcSource.top,
               &amp;props.rcSource.right, &amp;props.rcSource.bottom) == 5) {
    DwmRegisterThumbnail(hwnd, hwndTarget, &amp;g_hthumb);
    props.dwFlags = DWM_TNP_VISIBLE | DWM_TNP_RECTSOURCE |
                    DWM_TNP_RECTDESTINATION;

               -props.rcSource.left, -props.rcSource.top);
    props.fVisible = TRUE;
    DwmUpdateThumbnailProperties(g_hthumb, &amp;props);
  }</font>
  return TRUE;
}  

void
OnDestroy(HWND hwnd)
{
  <font COLOR=blue>if (g_hthumb) DwmUnregisterThumbnail(g_hthumb);</font>
  PostQuitMessage(0);
}

int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hinst, HINSTANCE hinstPrev,
                   LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nShowCmd)
{
   ...

        hwnd = CreateWindow(
            "Scratch",                      /* Class Name */
            "Scratch",                      /* Title */
            WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,            /* Style */
            CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT,   /* Position */
            CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT,   /* Size */
            NULL,                           /* Parent */
            NULL,                           /* No menu */
            hinst,                          /* Instance */
            <font COLOR=blue>lpCmdLine</font>);
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>
Our Little Program passes its command line through to the
<code>WM_<wbr>CREATE</code> message, which parses it as a
pointer (for Visual C++, a hex value with no <code>0x</code> prefix)
and four integers representing the left, top, right, and bottom coordinates
a rectangle within that window.
(For example, to get the upper left 100 pixels of the window,
pass <code>0 0 100 100</code>.)
It creates a thumbnail from that window and positions it inside
the scratch window.
</p>
<p>
Use Spy or whatever program to get a window handle and run the progarm
with the window handle and four integers (described above).
A live slice of the window will appear in the scratch program.
</p>
<p>
Making it easier to select the target window and a rectangle from it
is left as an exercise.
This is just a Little Program.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
