		<p>Executions can take a while &#8211; did anyone check with Legal if he was only alive pending appeals?</p>
<p>The military have a status of &#39;terminal leave&#39; when your service is up &#8211; referring to using up any remaining leave entitlement after you go home but before you leave the payroll, but it does seem to imply some sort of incurable medical problem.</p>

		<p>We&#39;re given that the intern was the subject of the termination, rather than the object, so it does not surprise me that he is OK.</p>

		<p>In my student days, around 1980, new languages fluorished, and my University contributed significantly to what became ITU&#39;s standard programmingh language for phone switches, CHILL. The contribution was a very well designed &#8211; but just tooo academic style! &#8211; language called Mary, named after the girlfriend of the chief language designer.</p>
<p>This was before &quot;Hello World!&quot; had been established as The Simplest Program. Rather, the standard presentation of the language usually opened with a small program printing out &quot;Mary has been executed&quot;.</p>

		<p>Several years ago, the product I was working on had a creatively Byzantine start-up process, with several different modules written in various languages successively loading each other. One of these modules was called the &quot;native&quot; (because it was written in C++ and compiled to an .exe containing native code, in contrast to the Java program that it would, in turn, load).</p>
<p>One step earlier in the chain was another module which tried to start the &quot;native&quot; module after doing various sanity checks. One of these sanity checks was that the &quot;native&quot; in fact existed on disk. If it didn&#39;t (which could happen after abotched or interrupted update/uninstall), the end user would be shown a message box reading:</p>
<p>&quot;Error: Could not find a native to execute!&quot;</p>
<p>at each login (!) because our product was obviously The World&#39;s Most Wonderful Program and therefore would default to adding itself to the Startup group at install.</p>
<p>Some time later, as I was working on code that would obsolete the native and native-starter as part of a new improved slightly less Byzantine start-up process, I made a special effort to identify a failure mode that could plausibly take over the traditional error message wording. Unfortunately, the higher-ups vetoed that.</p>

		<p>Why aren&#39;t business people learn to avoid ambiguity in business? They can sometimes introduce fatal issues (While this one is definately a &quot;fatal&quot; one).</p>

		<p>In the English language, many words have (too) many meanings. This applies to &quot;termination&quot; and &quot;execute&quot;. And it seems to me that such words (and other words too, of course) can be combined to a legal sentence by simply putting them together with some whitespace between them. (Maybe the word legal should be sentenced.) Moreover, it&#39;s often impossible to distinguish verbs and nouns.</p>
<p>I got used becoming confused by such sentences of such words.</p>

		<p>I suppose the manager would be doubly worried if the intern were named &quot;Termination Report&quot;.</p>
<p>My company also has a Termination Report. &nbsp;The people that run it are affectionately known as Terminators.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
