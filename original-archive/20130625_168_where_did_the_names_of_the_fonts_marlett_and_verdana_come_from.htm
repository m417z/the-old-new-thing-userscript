<p>Commenter BAA says that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/01/16/10256947.aspx#10257580"> the -lett part of Marlett comes from the designer Virginia Howlett</a>. BAA adds, "I forget the 'Mar' but I believe it was a co-creator."</p>
<p> If so, then that co-creator was Suzan <u>Mar</u>ashi, if Vincent Connare is to be trusted. On page 17 of the PDF document <a href="http://www.connare.com/darkside.pdf"><i>From The Dark Side...</i></a>, Connare identifies the authors of the font as Virginia Howlett, Rom Impas, Suzan Marashi, and Alison Grauman-Barnes. He also identifies Eliyezer Kohen as the person whose idea it was to use a special-purpose font. </p>
<p> According to Virginia Howlett, the original name for the font Verdana was <a href="http://www.dmxzone.com/go?6669&amp;LinkFile=page2.htm"> Ventana</a>, which means <i>window</i> in Spanish. Lawyers apparently objected to the name, and the font team explored variations on <i lang="es">verde</i> (which means <i>green</i> in Spanish) and <i>verdigris</i> (a green pigment), thereby invoking the color associated both with Washington (<i>The Evergreen State</i>) and Seattle (<i>The Emerald City</i>). The second part of the font name comes from Howlett's granddaughter Ana, following in the tradition of font designers naming fonts after their daughters. </p>

		<p>So Marlett might have been called Imshi or Marapas if history had gone slightly different. Or Howbarnes, I suppose. I firmly expect some Windows UI designer to title their book &quot;Marlett &amp; Me&quot;.</p>
<p>Verdana was my favorite Windows sans serif before Calibri came along (although Trebuchet is lovely too).</p>

		<p>@Azarien,</p>
<p>You mean, like &#39;windows&#39; cannot be registered as a trade mark because is is a common noun? Or &#39;macintosh&#39;? Or &#39;apple&#39;?</p>
<p>There is a story saying that when Intel tried to trademark &#39;486&#39; (without success), the judge dryly commented that the number 486 had been known and widely used in many different applications long before Intel created its CPU.</p>

		<p>In the olden days, when the Z80 processor was king, Zilog tried &#8212; without success &#8212; to both trademark and copyright the letter &quot;Z&quot;. &nbsp;Thankfully, a court of competent jurisdiction said, &quot;No way!&quot;</p>

		<p>@j b: &quot;Macintosh&quot; is not a real word. If you&#39;re thinking of an fruit, it&#39;s &quot;Mcintosh&quot;. And don&#39;t forget Apple Computer&#39;s issues with the Beatles.</p>
<p>The story of the 486 is a good example. &quot;486&quot; is perfectly trademarkable. The issue is that it was ruled that while nobody could make a &quot;486&quot; processor they could make a &quot;Am486&quot; or a &quot;5&#215;86&quot;. Basically, the more made up a word is, the stronger the trademark rights are.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
