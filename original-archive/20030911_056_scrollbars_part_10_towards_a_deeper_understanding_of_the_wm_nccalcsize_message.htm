<p>
        When your window is resized, Windows uses the <code>WM_NCCALCSIZE</code> message to
        determine where your window's client area lives inside your window rectangle. 
    </p>
<p>
        There are two forms of the <code>WM_NCCALCSIZE</code> message. The simple form merely
        takes a window rectangle and returns a client rectangle. This is useful for resizing
        a window to have a desired client rectangle, taking menu wrapping into account. The <code>AdjustWindowRectEx</code> function
        cannot take menu wrapping into account because it doesn't know which menu you are
        using. (Notice that there is no <code>HMENU</code> or <code>HWND</code> parameter
        to <i>AdjustWindowRectEx</i>.) 
    </p>
<pre>void
SetWindowClientSize(HWND hwnd, int cx, int cy)
{
    HMENU hmenu = GetMenu(hwnd);
    RECT rcWindow = { 0, 0, cx, cy };

    /*
     *  First convert the client rectangle to a window rectangle the
     *  menu-wrap-agnostic way.
     */
    AdjustWindowRectEx(&amp;rcWindow, GetWindowStyle(hwnd), hmenu != NULL,
                       GetWindowExStyle(hwnd));

    /*
     *  If there is a menu, then check how much wrapping occurs
     *  when we set a window to the width specified by AdjustWindowRect
     *  and an infinite amount of height.  An infinite height allows
     *  us to see every single menu wrap.
     */
    if (hmenu) {
        RECT rcTemp = rcWindow;
        rcTemp.bottom = 0x7FFF;     /* "Infinite" height */
        SendMessage(hwnd, WM_NCCALCSIZE, FALSE, (LPARAM)&amp;rcTemp);

        /*
         *  Adjust our previous calculation to compensate for menu
         *  wrapping.
         */
        rcWindow.bottom += rcTemp.top;
    }

    SetWindowPos(hwnd, NULL, 0, 0, rcWindow.right - rcWindow.left,
                 rcWindow.bottom - rcWindow.top, SWP_NOMOVE | SWP_NOZORDER);

}
</pre>
<p>
        <b>Exercise</b>: Explain why we used 0x7FFF to represent infinite height. 
    </p>
<p>
        <b>Exercise</b>: Explain the line <code>rcWindow.bottom += rcTemp.top</code>.

</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, I&#8217;ll take a stab&#8230; In Win 9x, coordinates are limited to 16 bits, and 7FFF is the largest quantity a signed 16-bit int can hold. So 7FFF is the largest number you can use there and have it work on all versions of Windows.</p>

		<p>Re: “Explain the line rcWindow.bottom += rcTemp.top.”<br />
Before calling sending WM_NCCALCSIZE, rcWindow contains the proposed area of the whole window (nonclient and client area).  After sending WM_NCCALCSIZE, rcTemp contains the coordinates of the window’s client area.  Therefore, rcTemp.top is actually the bottom most position of the top part of the window’s non-client area.  This is the area that the wrapped menu occupies and for which is being compensating for.  Therefore, the bottom of the window is moved down by that amount.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
