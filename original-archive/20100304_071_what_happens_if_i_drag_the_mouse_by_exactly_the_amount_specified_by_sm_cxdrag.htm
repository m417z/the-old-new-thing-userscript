<p>
The drag sensitivity is specified by the system metrics
<code>SM_CXDRAG</code> and <code>SM_CYDRAG</code>.
What happens if I drag the mouse by exactly the amount specified by
these two parameters?
</p>
<p>
Nothing.
</p>
<p>
These parameters control the drag <i>insensitivity</i> of the mouse.
If your mouse motion is less than or equal to this amount, then nothing
happens.
This is spelled out in the documentation for
<code>GetSystemMetrics</code>:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=m><p>
The number of pixels on either side of a mouse-down point
that the mouse pointer can move before a drag operation begins. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It's how far the mouse can move before the system detects a drag.
In code, the algorithm is as follows:
</p>
<pre>
BOOL ShouldStartDragging(POINT ptStart, POINT ptCur)
{
    RECT rc = { ptStart.x, ptStart.y, ptStart.x, ptStart.y };
    InflateRect(&amp;rc, GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXDRAG),
                         GetSystemMetrics(SM_CYDRAG));
    return !PtInRect(&amp;rc, ptCur);
}
</pre>
<p>
Some people appear to
have
<a HREF="http://xona.com/2006/12/12.html">
read a bit too much into the fluffy description</a>
of this setting.
I wrote the text to be vague so I wouldn't have
to go into annoyingly precise details.
It specifies how far the mouse must move, but I didn't say
exactly how.
Otherwise, the text (which is pretty full already)
would have had to say something unwieldy like
"Drag sensitivity specifies the distance (in pixels)
<i>beyond which</i> the mouse must move with the button held down..."
I did say that "the icon will begin dragging when you have
moved the mouse the necessary distance."
This was my way of saying,
"The test icon shows you what happens.
Just fiddle with the setting until the test icon behaves
the way you like."
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, I could've simply changed the word
<i>must</i> to <i>can</i>.</p>

		<p>To be fair, the blog you linked also states that the behaviour is dependent on the drag direction: two directions behaving like you said and two like he thought. I think that&#8217;s what pushed him into thinking too much about it.</p>
<p>Let me also take the opportunity of this post to thank you (and others?) for TweakUI.</p>

		<p>I would guess that&#8217;s because the mouse-delta is zero-based, increasing in the right and down directions, but you&#8217;d need to know the inner workings of InflateRect and PtInRect to confirm that.</p>

		<p>mh: Except that the behavior really <em>is</em> symmetrical as far as I can tell, so the only remaining explanation is a bug in TweakUI&#8217;s test icon &#8211; merely the opposite bug of what he thought it was &#8211; it moving immediately when dragging down/right with the value set to 1 is the bug.</p>
<p>(I can&#8217;t verify whether TweakUI actually behaves as described because for some unfathomable reason it refuses to run on Windows 7, and when compatibility mode is set it refuses to run on WOW64. I can&#8217;t think of anything it actually does for which either of these things could cause problems.)</p>

		<p>Ok, so this setting exists because most people don&#8217;t have pixel perfect control of their mouse in the first place. Then why would someone need to configure it with one pixel precision??</p>
<p>Although interesting, my answer to the question in the title would have been &quot;who cares&quot;?</p>

I guess that&#8217;s where the confusion is coming from.</p>

		<p>Then we have a bug in MSDN.</p>
<p>This article: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.systeminformation.dragsize.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.systeminformation.dragsize.aspx</a></p>
<p>states that DragSize (which is SM_CXDRAG x SM_CYDRAG, no conversion here) is a rectangle *within* which dragging will not start. So dragging will start when mouse moves SM_CXDRAG/2 pixels according to them. And a code example can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.dodragdrop.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.dodragdrop.aspx</a> , where this line of code is worth noting:</p>
<p>dragBoxFromMouseDown = new Rectangle(new Point(e.X &#8211; (dragSize.Width /2), &nbsp;e.Y &#8211; (dragSize.Height /2)), dragSize);</p>

		<p>From MSDN: &quot;The InflateRect function adds dx units to the left and right ends of the rectangle and dy units to the top and bottom.&quot;</p>
<p>Aided by this blog post and observed behaviour, I interpret this as:</p>
<p>lprc-&gt;left -= dx;</p>
<p>lprc-&gt;top -= dy;</p>
<p>lprc-&gt;right += dx;</p>
<p>lprc-&gt;bottom += dy;</p>
<p>From the MSDN page about the RECT structure:</p>
<p>&quot;Remarks</p>
<p>By convention, the right and bottom edges of the rectangle are normally considered exclusive. In other words, the pixel whose coordinates are ( right, bottom ) lies immediately outside of the the rectangle. For example, when RECT is passed to the FillRect function, the rectangle is filled up to, but not including, the right column and bottom row of pixels. This structure is identical to the RECTL structure.&quot;</p>

		<p>May I suggest that the MSDN text be revised to read as something along the lines of: &quot;The minimum number of pixels from a mouse-down point that the mouse pointer must be displaced before a drag operation begins.&quot;? This leaves considerably less room for erroneous interpretation than the phrase presently employed.</p>

		<p>After reading the &#8220;I can&#8221; comment (showing that the social skills of a thermonuclear device can be funny :-), I realized with horror that the current version of Tweak UI is only for Windows XP.</p>
<p>Do you have any intention of release a new version for Vista/7? I have been using Tweak UI for about ten years and I&#8217;m find it very useful for things like disabling auto insert on external drives (heck, even my girlfriend use it).</p>
<p>I know that there are more tweak tools or that I could edit the Registry, but I feel a lot more confident using and recommending a tool written by Raymond Chen himself, because I know that *he really knows* how to tweak Windows properly.</p>
<p>Anyway, many thanks for Tweak UI.</p>

		<p>I think this boils down to a difference in parsing. One could parse &quot;the mouse must move 5 pixels before starting a drag operation,&quot; as: a) the mouse will move 5 pixels, then b) a drag operation will start. That is, &quot;X before Y&quot; means &quot;X will happen, then Y will happen.&quot; Not &quot;X will happen, then some additional fraction of X will happen, then Y will happen.&quot;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t meant to be supreme nitpicking, just pointing out how someone could arrive at a different interpretation of that text in TweakUI.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
