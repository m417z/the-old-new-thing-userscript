<p>Commenter Jeff asks <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/06/14/10024197.aspx#10024788"> what the PRE in PREfast stands for</a>.</p>
<p> It's an inside joke. </p>
<p> The Microsoft Programmer Productivity Research Center (MSPPRC) <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc723542.aspx"> originally produced a tool called PREfix</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_howard"> Michael Howard</a> put me in touch with the development team, and they explained that it was called PREfix because it helps you <i>fix</i> your bugs before (<i>PRE</i>) you even run the code. </p>
<p> The problem with PREfix was that it required monster hardware, and even if you got the hardware up and running, the results took days to generate, and tuning the program's parameters required intricate knowledge of its inner workings. In other words, it was something only a researcher would love. </p>
<p> When they started sharing the tool with the product groups, the response was as you might expect: "This is great stuff you guys have here, but it's kind of impractical to expect everybody to have hundreds of thousands of dollars of hardware and a Ph.D. in order to run it." </p>
<p> The solution was a lightweight version of PREfix, which was named PREfast because it was a fast version of PREfix. It didn't do as thorough a job, but it didn't require monster hardware and could be understood by people who didn't have a brain the size of a planet. </p>
<p> In a sense, Jeff asked the wrong question. The real issue is not what the <i>PRE</i> stands for; it's what the <i>fast</i> stands for! </p>

		<p>So what you&#39;re saying is that the prefix &quot;pre&quot; in prefast stands for &quot;prefix&quot;?</p>

		<p>I&#39;m wondering why the &quot;PRE&quot; part of &quot;PREfix&quot; is in all caps. Perhaps it actually stood for something at some point (in addition to meaning &quot;before&quot;)?</p>

		<p>This seems pretty simple the PRE had a double meaning; pre as in before and pre as in prefix so they capitalised it to highlight that. Now they decide that the fact it&#39;s fast is the important bit so they ditch the fix for that. Like Raymond said an inside joke (and inside jokes by their nature aren&#39;t amazingly funny to an outside audience).</p>

		<p>Hrm. Given PREfast is practically given to everyone (I know the WDK comes with one version, and there&#39;s another somehwere else), I wonder what PREfix is like, after reading the description.</p>
<p>Sounds like a fun toy to cripple that quadcore PC IT&#39;s just given ya. (I have so many work PCs&#8230; including a quadcore one).</p>
<p>Alas, perhaps the only way is to get that lovebomb from Microsoft and move to Redmond. Then I&#39;d have to give up the quadcore.</p>

		<p>(Since PREfix was apparently ten years ago) would it still require monster hardware today?</p>

		<p>The thing with PREfix is that is runs on whole projects, and therefore on a project the size of Windows, it takes considerable hardware and time.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I ran PREfix on a smaller MS product (~500K lines, I think). Hardware was Dual-Xeon 2.8GHz with 2GB RAM &#8211; a lot for those days, though they skimped on HD. A run would take 10-14 hours. The program does require more knowledge than PREfast. It also requires more maintenance, since it stores its results in a combination of folders and MSSQL database, and presents it though a custom IIS site (with custom ActiveXs).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
