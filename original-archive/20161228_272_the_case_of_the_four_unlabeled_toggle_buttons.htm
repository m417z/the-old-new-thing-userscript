In an Insider build of Windows 10 some time ago,
there was a bug that caused four new toggle buttons
to show up in the Settings app,
<a HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/57r0be/so_uh_what_do_these_buttons_do_build_14946/">
but with no description
aside from "On" and "Off"</a>.
</p>
<svg version="1.1"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
  width="100" height="85"
  viewBox="-5 -5 95 80">
 <g id="button">
    <path stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="none" d="M20,0 A5,5 0 1,1 20,10 L5,10 A5,5,0,1,1,5,0 Z"/>
    <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="3" />
    <text x="35" y="8" font-family="Segoe UI, sans-serif" font-size="10">Off</text>
 </g>
 <use xlink:href="#button" y="20"/>
 <use xlink:href="#button" y="40"/>
 <use xlink:href="#button" y="60"/>
</svg>
<p>
The fact that this was a known bug didn't stop people on
the Windows team from wishing what the toggles really did.
</p>
<ul>
<li>"Make &lang;internal tool 1&rang; take less than 2 hours."</li>
<li>"&lang;internal tool 2&rang; always finds a valid checkpoint."</li>
<li>"Always submit my jobs to the front of the queue."</li>
<li>"Prevent partner teams from checking in stupid bugs."</li>
</ul>
<p>
In reality, the toggle buttons weren't hooked up
to anything.
They were associated with a new feature that,
if supported, would have provided descriptive text
as well as hooking up the toggle buttons so that they,
y'know, actually did something.
The bug was that when the feature was not supported,
they forgot to hide the inert toggle buttons.</p>

		<p>You won&#8217;t get an answer to that, Tanveer &#8211; if Raymond described it,  there would immediately be a couple of inveterate MS bashers out to say &#8220;look how MS fails to give us useful features&#8221; or &#8220;look at the rubbish feature MS wasted time on before canning it&#8221; &#8211; he can&#8217;t win either way,  so it&#8217;ll remain a mystery!</p>

		<p>What amuses me is the person in the comments that attributes all kinds of (presumably unrelated phenomena to these switches.) Post hoc ergo propter hoc.</p>

		<p>Could somebody please give all the current UI designers copies of _The Design of Everyday Things_?  These new sliders are basically &#8220;Norman Doors.&#8221;  Their state is completely ambiguous and they require you to figure out and then memorize which positions mean on or off.</p>
<p>Is that &#8220;Off&#8221; label on the right giving me the current status or telling me I need to move the dot to the right in order to turn it off?  How did this possibly make it through usability testing?  What was wrong with checkboxes?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
