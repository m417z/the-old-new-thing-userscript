<p> Back in Windows&nbsp;95, there was one bug that was originally filed against the window manager team. Upon closer investigation, the window manager team determined that the bug was really in the video driver and  added their analysis to the bug as they reassigned it. I don't know what overcame them, but the analysis was written in iambic pentameter. (It may have been rhymed couplets; my memory is kind of hazy. Gosh, I hope it wasn't haiku.) </p>
<p> At any rate, the device driver team added one comment to the bug immediately upon receiving it: "We ain't much fer book lernin'." </p>

		<p>Sorry, but with that parenthetical statement consisting of 3 phrases, one of which mentions haiku, I can&#8217;t help but rewrite it so:</p>
<p>Maybe rhymed couplets/Memory hazy like mist/I hope not haiku</p>
<p>:)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I should be a little proud or ashamed at the following commit log message for a class project I worked on:</p>
<p>&quot;refactoring / cbi_doStuff was long / not as much now&quot;</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m definitely not proud of the function name &quot;cbi_doStuff&quot; though.)</p>

		<p>When I cancel spam on the CodeGear/Borland newsgroups I&#8217;ll occasionally write poetry as the cancellation reason, e.g.:</p>
<p>Cancelling spam on a snowy Monday</p>
<p>Whose groups these are I think I know</p>
<p>Their building&#8217;s in Scotts Valley though</p>
<p>They will not see me cancel here</p>
<p>The posts of spammers, seeking dough</p>
<p>My XanaNews must think it queer</p>
<p>That Borland cannot engineer</p>
<p>A spam filter which does not take</p>
<p>The efforts of this volunteer</p>
<p>To click these links is a mistake</p>
<p>The products proffered must be fake</p>
<p>And though the prices might seem cheap</p>
<p>Just use your head, for goodness sake</p>
<p>The questions here are dark and deep</p>
<p>But I have ads and spam to sweep</p>
<p>Another pointer on the heap</p>
<p>Another pointer on the heap</p>

		<p>As a reader of those newsgroups, Craig, I have to say thanks for your work keeping them clean. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve never seen any of that poetry though?</p>
<p>That is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Reading non-tech posts:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Net monkeys complain too much</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thankfully, no ads</p>
<p>First one I&#8217;ve written for a long time, I think, but it seems appropriate for the topic :)</p>

		<p>Haiku&#8217;s overused.</p>
<p>Its prevalence is boring.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with sonnets?</p>

		<p>Farewell Haiku! thou art obscure for rhyming,</p>
<p>Yet fools around the world have found thee now,</p>
<p>The charter of thy birth is free from timing;</p>
<p>And boys enjoy the slaughter of thy vowels.</p>
<p>For how do I write thee but by thy granting?</p>
<p>And for that fault where is my recompense?</p>
<p>The myst&#8217;ry of thy verse is still enchanting,</p>
<p>And so my lust for thee still grows immense.</p>
<p>Thy self thou hid for cent&#8217;ries from all seeing,</p>
<p>But many now discovered thy strange form;</p>
<p>So thy great gift, not having escap&#8217;d fleeing,</p>
<p>Flies true again, on wing of quill&#8217;ed swarm.</p>
<p>Thus have we had thee, as a dream doth flatter,</p>
<p>In poets awed, but in new minds just chatter.</p>

<p>But ended up chugging</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
