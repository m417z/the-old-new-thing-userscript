<p>It&#8217;s not a question of &#8216;deserve&#8217;, and the eventual use of the funds is immaterial. What do they have to do to get us to give them the money in the first place? They put a gun to our heads. Of course, it it&#8217;s not their own gun, so they don&#8217;t wield it themselves; in the increasingly-fascist USA, you just find a way to get the federal government to do the dirty work for you.</p>

		<p>How much ink is wasted on fairly well-off folks &quot;suffering&quot; in the current economy really annoys me, too. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s a rant about it:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://gawker.com/5099094/the-infuriating-new-face-of-poverty" rel="nofollow">http://gawker.com/5099094/the-infuriating-new-face-of-poverty</a></p>
<p>I think journalists are aiming for stories that they think their readers would identify with or gawk at. &nbsp;They should spend more time focusing on what&#8217;s important, and what&#8217;s happening today to millions of poor folks seems to qualify.</p>

		<p>&quot;(Even though winter doesn&#8217;t start until the 21nd, but who&#8217;s counting?)&quot;</p>
<p>Here, there&#8217;s been winter for some time now. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute defines winter as the time when the average temperature is below 0 degrees Celcius.</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m not nitpicking. I hadn&#8217;t heard your definition of winter before, so I was interested and looked it up.</p>

		<p>@Randall</p>
<p>Back in the early 1970s, Alan Greenspan, not yet at the Fed, said that it was stockbrokers who were hit the hardest by the recession of those years. Calvin Trillin made fun of this in a column that presented the residents of Greenwich, Connecticut, &quot;Greenies&quot; as the new Okies. On the other hand, a stockbroker&#8217;s kid I knew didn&#8217;t find it amusing.</p>

		<p>The other side of the equation is where the problem lies though.. What happens to all the people employed as party planners? What happens to the models who won&#8217;t get paid to look pretty? Sure the Wall Street guys don&#8217;t get their fancy shindigs, but suddenly there&#8217;s a lot of other people who ain&#8217;t getting paid.</p>

		<p>&quot;(Even though winter doesn&#8217;t start until the 21nd, but who&#8217;s counting?)&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always found it interesting that seasons change on the 21st in some countries &#8211; I grew up with seasons changing on the 1st (winter started on dec 21st).</p>
<p>After all, midsummer is on 21 june, and I find it hard to grasp that midsummer = start of summer (even though wikipedia disagres, it defines midsummer as either the first day of summer or the middle of summer).</p>

<p>I assume you&#8217;re referring to things like AIG&#8217;s reward to its top sales people of whom brought in millions of dollars of sales to the company alone and represented a large portion of the company&#8217;s income?</p>
<p>Not to mention that the number of people from the financial products division present: &nbsp;0</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of the corporate shindig parties, but to be honest: &nbsp;virtually every company in that industry has some kind of lavish &quot;Holiday Party&quot; for their top performers. &nbsp;The fact that they only ( yes, Only ) spent $400k on it shows they are cutting back.</p>

		<p>The remarkable thing to me about the whole bailout thing is how tone deaf about PR these major companies are. &nbsp;I&#8217;m pretty sure that in order to prevent a melt-down, money was needed, but in the same week having a lavish party for execs (as *TLA company* did) was about the most clueless thing you could do.</p>

		<p>MS:</p>
<p>The PR of it was obviously recognized since they removed all the singing and tried to keep a low profile. &nbsp;However, you pay for these events several months in advance of the actual event. &nbsp;It&#8217;s hard to get money back from canceling a flight, I can&#8217;t imagine it&#8217;s much easier for a $400,000 event.</p>
<p>The point isn&#8217;t whether they&#8217;re receiving nice commissions or not &#8211; who&#8217;s place is it for us to tell someone how much being a top sales person is worth? &nbsp;I know if they&#8217;re anything like the top sales people that work for my company they are putting in 60 &#8211; 70 hours a week most weeks and probably working holidays, too. &nbsp;But I digress.</p>
<p>The point is that you are grossly misrepresenting a situation for the purpose of berating individuals who don&#8217;t deserve it ( for once ).</p>

		<p>The limo ride home isn&#8217;t lavish and is actually a good idea. &nbsp;The rates are typically comparable to a taxi service, and often cheaper due to being fixed per-trip or per-hour. &nbsp;Encouraging everyone to take the limo ride home reduces the chances of drunk driving, which is far more costly in all ways.</p>
<p>My employer offers taxi rides home from any party that involves alcohol. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve never heard anyone call that lavish.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
