<p>One of my friends bought me a souvenir one one of his trips to Germany. It is a beer mug from <a href="http://www.bayerischer-bahnhof.de/">Bayerischer Bahnhof</a>, a restaurant and brewery at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig_Bayerischer_Bahnhof"> Leipzig Bayerischer Bahnhof</a>. The mug carries the brewery's slogan <i lang="de">In vollen Z&uuml;gen genie&szlig;en</i>, which is a German idiom meaning "to enjoy to the fullest." Literally, "<span lang="de">Das Leben in vollen Z&uuml;gen genie&szlig;en</span>" means "to enjoy life in full gulps", the idea being that instead of sipping your way through life, you're taking huge gulps of it.</p>
<p> The slogan is a pun, though, for the Bayerischer Bahnhof, because the word <i lang="de">Zug</i> also means train. They come from the root <i lang="de">ziehen</i> which means "to pull". (Compare the English word <i>draught</i>, which has a similar duality.) </p>
<p> Therefore, the saying "<span lang="de">Das Leben in vollen Z&uuml;gen genie&szlig;en</span>" could also be interpreted as saying "Enjoy life in crowded trains." </p>
<p> Which is why it's the slogan of a brewery in a train station. </p>

		<p>Sounds like a good excuse to grab the mug and take a long weekend plane trip to Germany, where you spend the weekend repeatedly filling and emptying the mug at that very brewery.</p>

		<p>Note that &quot;Zug&quot; is among the most important German words if you believe Mark Twains essay about this crude language. I recommend that essay to everyone.</p>

		<p>Ah! Of course Oktoberfest has started. &nbsp;Hence the timing of this post. (Bonus chatter: Oktoberfest starts in September but does culminate at the last weekend in October &#8211; why wait any longer?).</p>

		<p>@creaothceann: although it&#39;s nowadays used for cigarettes too, the word in its current meaning goes back to at least the 13th century.</p>
<p>@Ben: Twain might have been interested to know the word existed in Old English (no doubt a similarly crude language) as &quot;tyge&quot;, from which we get &quot;tug&quot;. Interestingly, in English you can still tug on your cigarette, but not on your beer mug &#8212; in German (and Dutch) the word has come to be used for &quot;gulp&quot; too, but in English it&#39;s stayed closer to its roots.</p>

		<p>Raymond, the next time you are in Germany take the train to Leipzig. It&#39;s my favourite Hauptbahnhof. Fabulous old building, modernised with a 3-story shopping center.</p>
<p>The new berlin Hauptbahnhof is also not bad.</p>

		<p>@creaothceann</p>
<p>you&#39;re right, it can mean smoking as well.</p>
<p>And it is used ironically for travelling in crowded trains ;-)</p>

		<p>Oktoberfest culminates at *first* weekend in october. Except if it&#39;s on 1st or 2nd, then it culminates at the 3rd (Tag der deutschen Einheit (German Unity Day), a national holiday).</p>
<p>The reason why it starts in september is easy: in the beginning it lasted only one or a few days, and when they extended they extended in the direction of (usually) better weather :-)</p>

		<p>Today, smoking isn&#39;t allowed anymore in German trains. In the old days, you could sit in a crowded smokers compartment and have both!</p>

		<p>@JM: We have the same idiom in Norwegian as well, but the words are somewhat different, &quot;Ã¥ nyte i fulle drag&quot; &#8211; and you cannot take a &quot;drag&quot; from your beer mug, but you *can* from your cigarette! Literally, &quot;drag&quot; means pull, like pulling fresh air &#8230;or smoke&#8230; into your lungs.</p>
<p>And then, Zug -&gt; tyge -&gt; tug &#8230; To &quot;tygge&quot; in Norwegian is to chew. Maybe that word has the same root as the German/Dutch word for &quot;gulp&quot;? Fascinating. If I had known better I should have been working with natural languges, not programming languages.</p>

		<p>It can also mean &quot;Enjoy living in crowded trains&quot;.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
