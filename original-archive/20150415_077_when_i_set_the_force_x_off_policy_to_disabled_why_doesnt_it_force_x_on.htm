<p>A customer was using one of the many "force X off" policies, but instead of using it to force X off, they were trying to use it to force X on by setting the policy to Disabled. For example, there is a "Hide and disable all items on the desktop". The customer was setting this policy to Disabled, expecting it to force all icons visible on the desktop, removing the option on the desktop View menu to hide the icons.</p>
<p> As we discussed some time ago, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/06/10171462.aspx"> group policy is for modifying default behavior</a>, and interpreting them requires you to have a degree in philosophy. </p>
<p> In particular, a policy which forces X off has three states: </p>
<ul>
<li>Enabled: X is forced off. </li>
<li>Disabled: X is not forced off. </li>
<li>Not configured: No opinion. Let another group policy object decide. </li>
</ul>
<p> Disabling a policy means "Return to default behavior", and the default behavior in many cases is that the user can decide whether they want X or not by selecting the appropriate option. In philosophical terms, "Not forced off" is not the same as "Forced on." </p>
<p> If you want to force X on, then you have to look for a policy that says "Force X on." (And if there isn't one, then forcing X on is not something currently supported by group policy.) </p>

		<p>In fact, there is no need for a degree in philosophy. What is needed is the ability to read the labels and apply some basic logic to them. An ability that, sadly, is missing from many people that work with those over-logic machines called &quot;computers&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course, the logic is needed because of the double-negative (we are disabling a setting that hides icons, thus we are enabling it to show icons). If the policy was redacted the other way (&quot;Show and enable all items on the desktop&quot;), it would be easier. Now, when will that time machine be ready?</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a time I was trying to disable an optional component of a build, and tried all sorts of false-sounding values like WITH_CONTOSO=0. &nbsp;It turns out that only &quot;defining the variable&quot; was important, regardless of value, and the correct solution was to set WITHOUT_CONTOSO instead.</p>

		<p>A table would be helpful for this customer. &nbsp;Since this blog doesn&#39;t support any kind of tables in the comments, I&#39;ll approximate one:</p>
<p>1st row: The user wishes to turn X on</p>
<p>2nd row: The user wishes to turn X off</p>
<p>1st column: The policy &quot;force X off&quot; is enabled</p>
<p>2nd column: The policy &quot;force X off&quot; is not enabled</p>
<p>Each cell entry contains a Y if the user&#39;s desired is allowed or N if not allowed</p>
<p>Row 1: N Y</p>
<p>Row 2: Y Y</p>
<p>This customer really wants a policy that results in a column of Y/N, instead of the two currently supported columns of N/Y and Y/Y. &nbsp;I.e., a &quot;force X on&quot; policy.</p>

		<p>The annoying thing about this is that the double negatives are absolutely not required, Group Policy templates are perfectly capable of flipping the Enabled/Disabled values the other way around (i.e. Enabled = 0 and Disabled = 1) if needed in order to make the setting easier to use.</p>
<p>The way Policies are supposed to work is that Not Configured lets the end user decide and Enabled/Disabled force the setting into a particular state.</p>

		<p>To me this totally makes sense. 6/2=3 2/6!=3. You can&#39;t always turn things around. That degree in philosophy is not needed.</p>
<p>I think the problem is that the customer wanted something that was not there, and *hoped* this would work. Hoping is something else than thinking&#8230;</p>

		<p>[&quot;supposed to work&quot;]</p>
<p>&quot;supposed to work&quot; is in idiom meaning &quot;intended to work&quot; (still get requirements writer vs. implementer difference here but not implementer vs. end user). It&#39;s even pronounced &quot;suppost to work&quot; in this area, indicating that decomposing it into &quot;supposed&quot; as in &quot;believed&quot; is wrong.</p>
<p>In which case AndyCadley got it wrong.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I&#39;ve seen &quot;supposed to&quot; (pronounced as &quot;suppost&quot;) used in the sense of &quot;If I ruled the world, it would&#8230;&quot; so I am never sure.

		<p>Disabling a policy does not always mean reverting to the default behaviour, at least not according to the documentation.</p>
<p>For example, &quot;Turn off Windows Startup Sound&quot; says: &quot;If this policy setting is enabled, the Windows Startup sound will be turned off for all users. &nbsp;If this policy setting is disabled, the Windows Startup sound will be turned on for all users. &nbsp;If this policy setting is not configured, the Windows Startup sound will be turned on for all users by default and customizable in the Sound item of Control Panel.&quot;</p>
<p>IOW, it is documented to behave exactly as your customer expected the unspecified setting to behave. :-)</p>

		<p>Sounds like the UI for Group Policy is unnecessarily confusing. Would be easier if it was a drop-down option like this:</p>
<p>Desktop items visibility:</p>
<p>* Always visible</p>
<p>* User configurable (default)</p>
<p>* Always hidden</p>

		<p>I meant &quot;intended to work&quot;, because that&#39;s how the Group Policy engine does work. There may be individual settings where the code does something different (and to sysadmin&#39;s unexpected) but that&#39;s a whole different issue.</p>

		<p>Policies that implement the setting by following the rules you&#39;ve described break the expected behaviour of Group Policy inheritance. If you don&#39;t want a setting to be forced either way, you select Not Configured. Enabled/Disabled override this in the inheritance chain, following the rules of policy priority, to force a setting into a fixed state on/off as appropriate.</p>
<p>The policies that do work the way you&#39;ve described are an enormous PITA when it comes to trying to design/debug complex policy hierarchies. Whereas the ones like the one Harry Johnston mentions just work.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Enabled = Stop searching &#8211; the policy is enabled. Disabled = Stop searching &#8211; the policy is not enabled. Not configured = Keep searching. If nobody ever configures the policy, then it is not enabled. This is how, in practice, policies are implemented. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>The group policy engine doesn&#39;t &quot;stop searching&quot; though, it follows it&#39;s L-SDO inhertitance tree. With various caveats relating to Loopback Policy Processing and Blocked/Enforced policy objects.</p>
<p>The system works well for policies that follow the underlying design and is incredibly flexible, unfortunately developers who didn&#39;t understand the implications and constructed policies that don&#39;t play properly with the system design have lead to the situation that &quot;requires you to have a degree in philosophy&quot; to understand.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
