<p>Some years ago, one of my colleagues mentioned at the lunch table, "I went hiking this weekend, and man, my backpack was so heavy. I weighed it, and it was like 35 pounds. And then I realized, wait a second, I'm overweight by 35 pounds. I'm carrying this heavy backpack <i>all the time</i>!"</p>
<p> Thus began a collective weight loss competition we called <i>Weight Gain 4000</i>, named after <a href="http://www.southparkzone.com/episodes/102/Weight-Gain-4000.html"> an episode of <i>South Park</i></a> which had aired recently. ("I'm not fat; I'm big-boned!") I set up a Web page where people could enter their current weight, and it charted everyone's <i>pounds over target weight</i> as a function of time. Oh, and the goal was to lose weight, not gain it. </p>
<p> It so happened that I won this little competition with the aid of some extra bike rides. Then again, I also had the least amount of weight to lose. And my colleagues accused me of cheating because I managed to accelerate my weight loss as the deadline approached. (But I didn't cheat, honest!) </p>
<p> I was reminded of this competition from years ago when I read about <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2004374437_fatbet28.html"> John Dirks and Adam Orkand</a> who also learned that an effective way to make you stick to your weight loss plan is to <a href="http://www.fatbet.net/"> make a wager out of it</a>. </p>

		<p>but are you a BEEFCAKE!!~! ?</p>
<p>And is dropping water weight cheating or not ? The guys behind stinkymeat (a 1999 meme) did a parody of the &quot;lose 30 lbs in 30 days&quot; ads by recruiting a man and woman to gain 30 lbs in 30 days.. Hmm.. Seems it&#8217;s on the spark, but work won&#8217;t let me link to it.

		<p>I once got some spam from &quot;Colon Cleanse Support&quot; claiming I could &quot;Flush 20 Excess Pounds out of your Colon&quot;. &nbsp;Unfortunately the domain the image spam was hosted on is no longer active; it was hilarious.</p>

		<p>I started the Hacker&#8217;s Diet this year. &nbsp;It was created by an engineer. &nbsp;The nice bit is the tools &nbsp;(online or Excel spreadsheets) filter out the noisy fluctuations in your weight, so you get exactly the feedback you need to adjust your calories.</p>

		<p>Setting a goal for the weight you want to lose really helps.. I wanted to lose 20kg (=44 lbs) before I moved to my new house. Setting the &#8216;time limit&#8217; (of 6 months) made it a lot easier to keep up (and it helped to make sure I didn&#8217;t lose the weight too fast).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
