A customer had an idea of solving a program by reserving a huge
amount of memory with <code>Virtual&shy;Alloc</code>,
and then committing only the parts that are actually needed.
And by huge, they're talking about
100<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/11/9725386.aspx">GB</a>.
(Obviously, on a 64-bit machine.)
Is this okay, or is it a bad idea, or is it a terrible idea?
</p>
<p>
Starting in Windows 8.1
and Windows Server 2012 R2,
it's cheap to reserve a lot of virtual address space.
No major memory allocation or other charges occur
until you start committing pages,
in which case
the memory requirements are proportional to the amount of address space
you commit, rather than the amount of address space you reserve.
</p>
<p>
Things were different in earlier versions of Windows.
Back then, reserving address space still incurs a cost for creating
the page tables required to map the reserved region.
In the above example, a 100GB reservation would cost 200MB of memory
for the page tables.
Depending on the nature of the system you intend to run the program on,
this may be an acceptable cost.</p>

		<p>Of course, this change correlates nicely with Control Flow Guard, which reserves a few *TB* of address space for a bitmask of every possible code target.</p>

		<p>I thought I explained it in the last paragraph. The page tables for the reserved pages used to be created at reservation time. Now they are created on demand. (In other words, instead of creating a page table full of &#8220;reserved&#8221; entries, you can create a page directory entry that marks the entire page table as &#8220;reserved&#8221;. This saves you a page table.)</p>

		<p>Another fun thing you can do with loads of reservated space is creating objects that will not reuse addresses. Must make debugging simpler and exploiting annoying.</p>

		<p>I guess this makes Large Pages rather less important now, especially if you don&#8217;t need them all. That&#8217;s a relief, since it took elevated permissions and they couldn&#8217;t be paged out to disk.</p>

		<p>Um, you can&#8217;t reserve large pages in the first place (you can only commit them), so this has no effect on large pages.</p>

		<p>Large pages are still very much relevant. The (big) reason for using large pages is the limited size of TLBs. Once you start accessing more memory than (page size) * (number of TLB entries) in a &#8220;random&#8221; way (databases being the prime example of this), the poor CPU will need to start walking page tables, which are stored in RAM. So one memory access turns into several, potentially causing very severe performance issues.<br />
The change this article refers to only applies before you actually start using most of the reserved memory.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
