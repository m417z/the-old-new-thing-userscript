<p>It depends on what you mean by default.</p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/10/2065725.aspx"> As we saw earlier</a>, the convention for Windows header files is that if you don't specify a particular version, then you get the most recent version. The shell common controls header file follows this convention, so if you include the Windows&nbsp;XP version of <code>commctrl.h</code>, you get functions, messages, and structures designed for use with version&nbsp;6 of the common controls. (And functions, messages, and structures may not work with version&nbsp;5 of the shell common controls due to changes in structure sizes, for example.) So from the Windows&nbsp;XP Platform SDK header file's point of view, the default version of the shell common controls is version&nbsp;6. </p>
<p> On the other hand, there's the question of what version of the shell common controls you actually get at run time. Prior to Windows&nbsp;XP, the answer was simple: You got the most recent version installed on the machine. </p>
<p> With Windows&nbsp;XP, however, the rules changed. The visuals team wanted to do something more ambitious with the common controls, but the compatibility constraints also created significant risk. The solution was to use side-by-side assemblies. </p>
<p> For compatibility, if a program didn't specify what version of the shell common controls it wanted, it got version 5.82, which was carefully designed for extremely high compatibility with the previous version, 5.81, which came with Windows&nbsp;2000 and Windows&nbsp;Me. Now, version&nbsp;5.82 is not completely identical to 5.81, because it also needs to interoperate with version&nbsp;6. More on this later. </p>
<p> If a program wanted to use version&nbsp;6 of the common controls, it had to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/userex/cookbook.asp"> say so explicitly in a manifest</a>. (What we on the shell team informally call a "v6 manifest".) That way, only programs that asked for the new behavior got it. The theory being that if you asked for the new behavior, you presumably tested your program against version&nbsp;6 of the common controls to verify that it behaves as you expected. This freed up the visuals team to make more substantial changes to the common controls without having to worry about some old program that relied on some strange undocumented behavior of the common controls. That old program would get version&nbsp;5.82, which was designed for high compatibility. </p>
<p> Now, on that interoperability thing. There are places where the common controls library creates an object which you can then use with other common controls. For example, you can create an image list with <code>ImageList_Create</code> and then use that image list in a list view or tree view. Care had to be taken so that an image list created by version&nbsp;5 of the common controls (a "v5 image list") could be used by a list view created by version&nbsp;6 (a "v6 list view"), or conversely that a v6 image list could be used in a v5 list view. This sort of cross-version image list usage is actually quite common: Any application that calls <code>Shell_GetImageLists</code> (or its old-fashioned equivalent, <code>SHGetFileInfo</code> with the <code>SHGFI_SYSICONINDEX</code> flag) will get a v6 image list. If that application uses version&nbsp;5 of the common controls (because it doesn't have a v6 manifest), then it will find itself using a v6 image list inside a v5 list view. Since each DLL has its own manifest, you can quickly find yourself in a case where there is a hodgepodge of v5 and v6 components all inside a single process, and they all have to work with each other. </p>
<p> Another example of this cross-version interoperability is the <code>HPROPSHEETPAGE</code>. Property sheet pages created with <code>CreatePropSheetPage</code> from one version of the shell common controls had to work with the <code>PropertySheet</code> function of the other version. This happens a lot with shell property sheet extensions. The shell namespace will ask the shell extensions to provide their custom property sheets, and all the ones written for Windows&nbsp;2000 will hand back a v5 <code>HPROPSHEETPAGE</code>. But Explorer is going to display that property sheet with the v6 <code>PropertySheet</code> function. That v5 property sheet page had better work even when hosted inside a v6 property sheet. </p>
<p> Okay, but back to the original problem. If you don't specify what version of the header file you want, then you get the latest version (version&nbsp;6 if you got the header file from the Windows&nbsp;XP Platform SDK). On the other hand, if you don't specify what version of the DLL you want, you get version 5.82, the compatible version of the DLL. <i>Yes, this is a mismatch. Be on the lookout</i>. This is what happens when a header file convention is at odds with a compatibility decision. </p>

		<p>Is 6 supposed to be backwards-compatible with 5.82? I&#8217;ve had problems with using 5.82 structures with 6. It is understandable if it isn&#8217;t, since I need a manifest to get 6.</p>
<p>Also, what&#8217;s the common controls version in Vista? Is it still 6?</p>

		<p>By the way, I have to applaud the plunge you guys took regarding using SxS dlls for v5 vs. v6. &nbsp;I especially respect the &#8220;isolation aware&#8221; stuff, as it allowed DLL&#8217;s in our tools to use v6 features, while letting us take our time on transitioning everything else to v6.</p>
<p>I have to wonder, management-wise, how hard of a problem was the v5/v6 interop? &nbsp;Was it something that really manifested as an issue late in development, or was the full scope pretty much known at the beginning?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>v5/v6 interop was a huge undertaking. Your last question presents a false dichotomy. We knew up front that it would be a lot of work, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we understood the full scope up front. Do you ever know the full scope of a large undertaking before you begin?

<p>Oh, I get that, I was just curious the level of planning that goes into an undertaking like this. &nbsp;Like was it &#8220;well, we&#8217;ll need some interop&#8221; or was it down to the nitty gritty of &#8220;property pages will need to be cross compatible&#8221; ? &nbsp;Also, was the dll-isolation-support planned from the get-go, so something that came of incompatibilities after implementation began?</p>
<p>To me, it could just be an interesting case-study into planning-and-consequences of things at Microsoft. &nbsp;And since this is relatively recent, it seems a bit more relevant given the maturity of the platform as compared to design decisions on Win16 or Win32. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not trying to grill you, but it seems to be one of the more impressive and risky gambits given the huge size of windows, and a peephole as to how it was pulled off so well could be a decent learning experience.</p>

<p>Of course, when the price of admission is nothing, anything at all (including nothing itself) is worth the price of admission&#8230; usually considerably more.</p>

		<p>Speak of the devil.</p>
<p>&gt; The solution was to use side-by-side assemblies.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people, faced with a problem, say &#8216;I know what, I&#8217;ll use regular expressions. &nbsp;Then they have two problems.&quot;</p>

<p>Well I&#8217;m not holding my breath, but I at least wanted the request out there. &nbsp;At the very least, it may be something to expand on in further blog posts if you have the time. &nbsp;I would hope I&#8217;m speaking for a decent amount of people that finds this sort of talk interesting. &nbsp;Most of us don&#8217;t have the opportunity to work on projects with an impact on literally tens of millions of people.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
