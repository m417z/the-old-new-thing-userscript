		<p>Now I think the only feature I can&#39;t figure out how to use properly in WMP is subtitles and Videos with multiple audio tracks.</p>
<p>Last time I tried, WMP just played EVERY audio track at the same time :|</p>

<p>This also depends on filters. It is quite easy to get this to work with no problems just by installing the right ones.</p>

		<p>The most natural way (no guesswork required) would have been to use left and right arrow keys when paused as Media Player Classic does. WMP 12 and 11 are some of the top reasons I avoid Windows 7 and Vista. WMP 10 was the BEST version. If somehow I could virtualize it using App-V or ThinApp on Windows 7.</p>

		<p>@Anders Elfgren: Last time Raymond posted a tip about Windows Media Player, the comments were filled with people saying &quot;you shouldn&#39;t use it!! Use another program!! etc.&quot; He&#39;s trying to pre-empt comments like that.</p>

		<p>Can you ask the developer who tipped you off to it to bind the left and right keyboard arrows to single step forward and backwards?</p>

		<p>Yay. It seems Raymond didn&#39;t make good on his threat to kill the tips sections!</p>
<p>Everyone but Raymond: Let&#39;s keep it that way. Before now, practically one person knew (besides Raymond). Who knows what other tricks Raymond might reveal that only the developer knows? It could be useful and save time or bypass annoyances.</p>

		<p>@640k: It&#39;s not banned. Microsoft just have to make Windows 7 N &#8211; the version with no Media Player, stupid product name as agreed with the European Commission &#8211; available in the marketplace alongside regular Windows 7, and they&#39;re not allowed to make it more expensive. Therefore, the price is the same as regular Windows 7. Because it is optional, and it costs the same, no OEMs ship Windows 7 N and the only place you&#39;re guaranteed to find it is in your MSDN Subscription.</p>
<p>Microsoft reportedly claimed that only 1,500 copies of Windows XP N editions had been sold to OEMs, and zero consumer sales. The reference on Wikipedia isn&#39;t cited or dated.</p>
<p>The Korean government did the same with Windows Messenger, which is why Windows XP Home and Professional K and KN Editions existed. The problem was solved in Windows 7 by no longer bundling Windows Live Messenger with any edition of Windows.</p>
<p>The authorities got a bit smarter with the bundling of Internet Explorer, there is an automatic update defaulted to download and install called the &#39;Browser Choice&#39; update &#8211; once applied it unpins IE from the taskbar and you have to explicitly select it to get it back. Fortunately it isn&#39;t a critical update as far as WSUS is concerned, so I&#39;ve declined it through WSUS and won&#39;t have to handle the support calls.</p>

		<p>Why is it not advisable to use Windows Media Player? Because it changes the interface in every single version. Which software does that except WMP, I dunno! Really! Completely changes the interface in EVERY version.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
