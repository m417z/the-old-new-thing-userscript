I noted some time ago
that
starting in Windows Vista,
<a HREF="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj663498.aspx">
final build numbers must be a multiple of 16</a>.
Why is that?
</p>
<p>
The version number comes in four parts,
each consisting of a 16-bit integer:
major.minor.build.revision.
The major and minor numbers correspond to the programmatic
operating system version.
For example,
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/05/07/10416464.aspx">
poseurs refer to Windows 7 as version 6.1</a>.
because its programmatic major version is 6
and its programmatic minor version is 1.
Nobody at Microsoft calls it that; we just call it Windows&nbsp;7.
</p>
<p>
The build number generally increases by one each time the build lab
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/11/12/10466467.aspx">
spins up</a> a build,
although there are occasional jumps and gaps,
<a HREF="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj663498.aspx">
as I noted in the linked article</a>.
</p>
<p>
The revision number is under the control of the servicing team.
And here's what they needed to encode:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Four bits for the service pack number,
    where zero represents RTM.</p>
<li>One bit to indicate whether this is a non-milestone build.
    (And no, I don't know what that means.)</p>
<li>One bit to indicate whether this is a build intended to be released
    to the public.</p>
<li>Two bits to indicate which release track the build is from.
    <a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsvistanow/archive/2008/03/11/what-is-the-difference-between-general-distribution-and-limited-distribution-releases.aspx">
    0 = GDR, 1 = LDR</a>, 2 = (unused), 3 = private build.</p>
<li>Twelve bits to encode the servicing build number.&sup1;
</ul>
<p>
Add this all up and you'll see that this requires 20 bits.
But the revision field is only 16 bits wide.
Therefore, the servicing team needs to find 4 additional bits
somewhere,
and by requiring that the RTM build number be a multiple of 16,
they get their extra four bits.
</p>
<p>
One of the changes to the servicing stack in Windows 10
is that the servicing team redesigned their version numbering system
so that they need only 16 bits of information rather than 20.
I don't know the details of how they accomplished it;
all I know is that they no longer need to reserve the bottom four
bits of the build number.
In other words, the build number no longer needs to be a
multiple of 16.
</p>
<p>
Most people in the Windows division were unaware of this
change to the servicing stack.
When the announcement came down that the release management team were
hoping that build 10584 would be the final build for the
November 2015 update,
many people didn't believe it.
"That can't be the final build.
It's not a multiple of 16!"&sup2;
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
The fact that this provides enough daily builds to cover
the five-year mainstream support lifecycle is probably not
a coincidence.
</p>
<p>
&sup2;
Yes, the actual final build for the November 2015 update is 10586.
I guess the release management team decided to take
two more fixes.</p>

		<p>There are no service packs for Windows 10, only newer builds, so the service pack number is no longer required. There are no longer different release tracks, all updates are cumulative. That gets 6 bits back even before you consider the fairly useless non-milestone and public bits.</p>

		<p>So they removed the bits representing the service pack number, which allowed the build number to expand to 16 bits from 12 bits.</p>

		<p>Intel were told they couldn&#8217;t patent the number 486, so rather than use 586 for the next chip they used Pentium.<br />
Although people still used 586 &amp; 686 for the Pentium and Pentium Pro &amp; other manufacturers also used the numbers too.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just a coincidence though.</p>

		<p>Poseurs? You bet.</p>
<p>The other day, this guy comes to Wikipedia and says, hey I know the sources keep saying NT 10 but the actual version number of Windows 10 is NT 6.4! Fortunately, people who knew better shut him up.</p>
<p>Somehow, there are a lot of people who think Wikipedia should have a concise but comprehensive version number listing for Windows versions. At least that has *some* uses. But sprawling lists of build numbers and revision numbers? Those belong to idiots who can&#8217;t even imagine writing a Featured Article and instead fill articles with junk. Most of them claim to be Microsoft employees too. When they do, this is the ticket for reverting their actions because per Wikipedia&#8217;s COI policy, a Microsoft employee is not allowed to edit a Microsoft-related article. (Real Microsoft employees seem to be aware of this.)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
