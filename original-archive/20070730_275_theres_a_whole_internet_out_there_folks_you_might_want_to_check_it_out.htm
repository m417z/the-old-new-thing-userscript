<p>If you're going to add a topic to the Suggestion Box,&sup1; at least do the courtesy of researching the question before asking it. It takes me an hour to answer each question; it's only fair that you spend ten minutes making it a good question.</p>
<p> For example, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#437026"> one entry in the Suggestion Box asked for the story behind the <code>MANUALLY_INITIATED_CRASH</code> hotkey</a>. But even the most cursory search on the Internet for the phrase <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=manually+initiated+crash"> manually initiated crash</a> reveals as the #1 hit <a href="http://searchwinit.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid1_gci965142,00.html"> an explanation of the circumstances under which you would want to enable this feature in the first place</a>. </p>
<p> As another example, one commenter asked <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/15/1081320.aspx#1081632"> where I got the grayscale conversion formula from</a>, but a few minutes of tinkering with a search engine will reveal all sorts of articles on grayscale conversion. (Heck, that's how I found the formula in the first place!) </p>
<p> Generally speaking, I just ignore questions that are poorly-researched, but I felt the need to call out the issue in the first place so you can understand why I ignored your question. </p>
<p> <b>Footnote</b> </p>
<p> &sup1;Yes, the Suggestion Box is closed for now, since it's got enough suggestions to last me for years. If your suggestion is that totally awesome, then you will surely remember it when the Suggestion Box reopens in early 2010. </p>

		<p>You&#8217;re aware that by closing the suggestion box you&#8217;re inevitably turning comment sections of individual entries into new suggestion boxes, right?</p>
<p>Think about it:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm, the suggestion box is closed. My question is so awesome though &#8212; I want him to see it; he&#8217;ll surely answer it before 2010. Oh! I know, I&#8217;ll just reply to today&#8217;s blog post, cluttering it up with another unrelated comment. That way he can&#8217;t miss it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my 10 cents.</p>

		<p>I certainly sympathize when asked questions that are easy to research as the examples Raymond gave.</p>
<p>Other times, though, searching isn&#8217;t as easy as it seems when you don&#8217;t know the magic search terms.</p>
<p>For example, a couple posts ago, Raymond told me there were debug versions of the Windows DLLs for developers to use to find bugs. &nbsp;I had a vague recollection of something like that back in 3.1 days, so I went searching to see where to find these beasts today.</p>
<p>I checked the indexes on MSDN, Live Search, Google, Petzold, Richter, Robbins. &nbsp;All of the terms (Windows, system DLLs, debug, user32, WinAPI, win32, Platform SDK, etc.) were too generic. &nbsp;I asked my co-workers here at MSFT and at previous companies. &nbsp;No leads.</p>
<p>Two days later, after having given up, I stumbled on the magic phrase &quot;checked builds&quot;. &nbsp;Lo and behold, there it is in the Device Driver Kit documentation.</p>
<p>Point is, researching is a lot easier if you know what you&#8217;re looking for, like looking up a word in the dictionary when you already know how to spell it.</p>

		<p>One of my favorite writers, Piers Anthony, uses word-puns in his Xanth books that were submitted by fans and gives credit for these submissions. &nbsp;As one might expect, this has created a huge backlog for Mr. Anthony and he has enough material to last several future books. &nbsp;You might want to check-out how he handles the volume with his &quot;suggestion-box&quot; instead of closing yours &#8212; just a suggestion.</p>

		<p>Alternatively, if you&#8217;re going to ask *anyone* smart (and Raymond definitely qualifies there) *any* question, and if you&#8217;re not paying them to answer your question, then you might do them the courtesy of reading &quot;How to ask questions the smart way&quot;. Despite how it reads, it doesn&#8217;t just apply to questions asked of open-source hackers about software.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to bother posting a link &#8211; if you can&#8217;t find it yourself when I&#8217;ve given you the title, you&#8217;re not likely to read it anyway! :)</p>

		<p>I wonder how much legacy Win32 code will be written in 2010. Of course there will always be a need, but in the last decade I would estimate that approximately 98% of my work has been managed code (Java, .Net), and that number is growing every year.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
