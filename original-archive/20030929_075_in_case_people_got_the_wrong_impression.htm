<p>         I really did enjoy my trip. I just like talking about the goofy things.      </p>
<p>         I intend to go back to Sweden in the spring. I'm currently enrolled in Swedish lessons         but this trip came far too soon for me to have learned anything useful aside from         "tack", "urs&auml;kta" and "Jag taler inte svenska." Though the lady behind the register         was exceedingly pleased to see a blatant foreigner buying Swedish children's books.         Everybody in Sweden speaks perfect English (it's quite embarrassing, actually), so         Swedes are honored when a foreigner actually bothers to learn Swedish. I'm told that         one of the factors contributing to astounding English-language abilities in Sweden         is that American TV shows and movies are not dubbed into Swedish when imported; they         are merely subtitled.      </p>
<p>         The &Oslash;resund bridge is totally awesome.      </p>
<p>         Amusingly, when you take the ferry from Denmark to Germany, the toll booth agent speaks         Danish and expects you to speak Danish. When you take the same ferry in the reverse         direction, the toll both agent speaks German and expects you to speak German.      </p>
<p>         The ferry schedules are published only in Danish. Just our luck, of all the languages         of all the countries we were visiting, that's the only one none of us knew. We had         a choice of two ferries, and we were unable to determine with confidence what times         each one ran, how much time the crossing lasted, and when the last ferry of the day         was.      </p>
<p>         I studied German for five years, but that was a long time ago and my vocabulary has         decayed heavily since then. Actually, my listening ability never got very good. On         all the exercise tapes, they talk painfully slowly and clearly, whereas in real life,         people talk rapidly and don't enunciate clearly. I could usually follow about two         or three sentences before the rate of input exceeded my ability to process it. I got         around okay, but it was slow going. I've also been told that my German is overly formal         and stilted. (Is there such a thing as "overly stilted"? As opposed to what, "just         stilted enough"?)      </p>
<p>         I am myself not a vegetarian, but my two travelling companions are. We discovered         the secret to finding vegetarian food: find an Indian restaurant or an Italian restaurant.         An Indian restaurant will have an extensive vegetarian menu. ("Scharf" is a good word         to know, too.) An Italian restaurant will have a few vegetarian options. We weren't         sure about German or French restaurants. We concluded that, while a French restaurant         is more likely to have vegetarian dishes or be able to convert an existing dish to         vegetarian, a German restaurant would be less likely to be annoyed at the request.         (We only tested this theory once: I stopped at a German restaurant and asked if they         had any vegetarian entrees; the answer was no.)      </p>
<p>         It's a good thing the glockespiel at the Marienplatz is so badly out of tune - it         sets expectations for the show that follows.      </p>
<p>         The important lessons at Oktoberfest were not learned by me firsthand, thank goodness.      </p>
<p>         The Deutsches Museum is ridiculously huge. We spent an entire day there.      </p>
<p>     We did not get to spend as much time in Berlin as the city deserved. Berlin is a "real city" as opposed to Munich, which is a "tourist city". </body></p>

		<p>My husband has family in Berlin, I&#8217;d like to go visit some time.  However, I don&#8217;t think most of them speak English, so that would kind of suck as we&#8217;re very bad at other languages.  They really should start people in this country to learning languages earlier.  Eh.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad you had a good trip, I&#8217;m disappointed that you didn&#8217;t barf at Oktoberfest, yet strangely relieved, ;)</p>

		<p>Oh dear, I live in munich 5 years now and I never listen to the glockenspiel. I don&#8217;t think, I missed something. I agree that munich is a tourist city, like whole bavaria with Schloss Neuschwanstein and that stuff. But why did you come here? And why are the americans always buying these Kuckucksuhren?</p>

		<p>I completly agree that subtitling tv programs instead of dubbing contributes to good english skills. I live in Israel and have been in Germany, Austria, France, Switzerland and Spain. I was always surprised by the fact that most people you interact with as a tourist simply don&#8217;t know english. In Israel (our language is very different than the latin languages) most people know english very well &#8211; and i&#8217;m pretty sure tv shows (most are american) are contributing factor.</p>

		<p>One thing that could keep you hungry outside of the US &#8212; an &quot;entree&quot; is an appetiser in other countries, whereas (for reasons that elude me) it means &quot;main course&quot; here in America.<br />
Dubbing movies is the worst thing you can do to them; it&#8217;s too confusing when the sounds don&#8217;t match the actors&#8217; lip movements. Then again, a lot of people mess up the subtitles and you end up with white text on a white background (&quot;So Close,&quot; anyone?)</p>

		<p>Slightly geeky question:</p>
<p>I assume everyone&#8217;s seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon &#8211; it seems to be a popular film among geeks.</p>
<p>Did you watch it:</p>
<ul>
<li>in Chinese (Mandarin, I think), no subtitles</li>
<li>in Chinese with subtitles</li>
<li>dubbed into your native language.</li>
</ul>
<p>I watched it in Chinese with English subtitles, but found that after about half an hour, I wasn&#8217;t consciously reading the subtitles any more. Maybe I was reading them subconsciously, or maybe it just didn&#8217;t matter&#8230;</p>

		<p>When you ask for an &quot;entree&quot; most people in europe think its a starter or something. There are very few restaurants in germany where you don&#8217;t get some vegetarian meal. At least I never found one&#8230;<br />
The thing with the dubbed movies and tv shows is true. And its a real shame that in germany or france you can only watch them dubbed. Usually the dubbing is done well and matches the lip movement, but it ruins lots of jokes :(</p>

		<p>Well if you learn Swedish you will be able to read Danish, you will also be able to communicate with Danes, but only if they want to be polite and try and understand your Swedish. So you will speak english to the Danes.</p>

		<p>Hey, why not visit Finland the next time you&#8217;re around? Learning the language should be challenging to say the least. And you could see where that Linux thing got started. ;)</p>

		<p>Bah, every restaurant I can show you around here got something vegetarian to eat. Problem might only be that a lot of waitresses are not helpful at pointing them out :(<br />
I usually go for the pizzerias since they give best food to value ratio :)</p>

		<p>If you go back to Sweden in the spring I would recommend you to visit Gothenburg. It is a smaller &quot;big city&quot; than Stockholm and referred to as &quot;Little London&quot; because of the huge trade between the cities during the 18th-19th centuries.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
