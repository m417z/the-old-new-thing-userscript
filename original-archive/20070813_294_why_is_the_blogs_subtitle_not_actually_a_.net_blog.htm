<p>Based on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/08/07/690947.aspx"> the feedback from my last CLR week</a>, I think one CLR week a year is about right, Welcome to CLR Week 2007.</p>
<p> I'll kick off the week with something not actually technical, but which might be puzzling to the newcomers: Why is the blog's subtitle "Not actually a .NET blog"? </p>
<p> When I started, the blog hosting site for Microsoft technical bloggers was <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/">blogs.gotdotnet.com</a>, and this site was consequently located at <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/oldnewthing/"> blogs.gotdotnet.com/oldnewthing</a>. (The old address still works. Blog backward compatibility, I guess.) It was the .NET folks like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/">Brad Abrams</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/">Chris Brumme</a> who started the big wave of Microsoft blogging in 2003, and when they set me up, they set me up with what they had. </p>
<p> I chose the subtitle, therefore, because the name gotdotnet.com implied that all the blogs would be .NET-related, but mine wasn't. The blog moved to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/"> weblogs.asp.net</a> and then to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/"> blogs.msdn.com</a>, so the .NET assumption no longer applied, but I kept the tag line anyway. </p>
<p> (If you want something technical for the start of CLR Week, may I recommend <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2005/12/13/503225.aspx"> this puzzle from Eric Gunnerson on how overloaded functions are resolved in derived classes</a> and this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nealho/archive/2006/01/19/515173.aspx"> bonus puzzle from Neal Horowitz</a>.

		<p>The old url still works? That&#8217;s the trouble with you guys, layering on backward compatibility hack after backward compatibility hack. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why this blog is limited to one post a day! When will M$$$$ wake up and realize they need to start fresh! &nbsp;If a link breaks, call up the linker and tell him to fix his site!</p>

		<p>This post is a good example of how features get implemented in Windows&#8230;and stay around long after they no longer make sense.</p>

		<p>To be fair, us unix weenies struggle with backwards compatibility too. Why else would select(2) still be around? Or horror-upon-horrors, SysV IPC?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ll grant SysV IPC was a bad idea, but there were similar IPC systems around in the world. &nbsp;Maybe it was more a bad vision (I hesitate to say &quot;implementation&quot;) of some of those other systems.</p>
<p>OTOH, select is easier to use than poll when you&#8217;re just doing something trivial. &nbsp;Consider a terminal / console application. &nbsp;You only have to worry about file descriptors up to 2. &nbsp;But select is loss for a server app where they can go up to a bazillion.</p>
<p>I just wish I didn&#8217;t still run into C runtimes where fileno field of a FILE is a char.</p>

		<p>@Slashdot Guy</p>
<p>1 post per day of what? &nbsp;There are 2 posts today, and I can post multiple comments per day. &nbsp;So I don&#8217;t see how that fits. &nbsp;The 1 post per day thing typically done by Raymond is I think more choice than &quot;limit&quot;</p>

		<p>See, &quot;Slashdot Guy&quot;, that&#8217;s an interesting statement, because the links in old posts (which were on weblogs.asp.net originally) to other old posts (that were likewise on weblogs.asp.net) actually *don&#8217;t* work. &nbsp;:-P &nbsp;I believe weblogs.asp.net changed their archived-post URL scheme at some point, or maybe they just removed all the old posts when everybody moved to blogs.msdn.com. &nbsp;Either way.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;d be a PITA to go back and fix all those links, though, so Raymond: don&#8217;t bother. &nbsp;If it&#8217;s even possible. &nbsp;(It&#8217;s not too difficult to look the posts up here manually, based on date.)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
