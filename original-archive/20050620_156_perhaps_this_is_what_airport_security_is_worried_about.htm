		<p>I believe this post fits better in Dave Barry&#8217;s blog, in the &quot;Those Terrorist Bastards&quot; series:<br />

		<p>I was fascinated to read the claim in the article that static electricity- in addition to exploding frantic sewers- also causes travel sickness. A bit of googling seems to show that that&#8217;s an urban legend though.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve done a round-the-world trip a few months ago, and I was amazed that at Dallas International airport, after passing all the security checks to get to the international terminal, you could walk into a restaurant, order a steak, and they&#8217;ll bring you a steak knife.  There are no more security checks from there, since the boarding gate is 20 meters away.</p>
<p>All for show.</p>

		<p>Steak knives used to be restricted inside the gate area.  A bunch of restaurants that had served steaks complained, since they were no longer allowed either knives of any form or metal implements.  Floor space in airports is expensive, and they were losing money hand over fist, since they could no longer serve the more expensive dishes.</p>

		<p>Fine, guess I shouldn&#8217;t have added tags around those hyperlinks.  Just google on [steak &quot;airport security&quot; knives] or similar terms.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s really funny, as one of my brother&#8217;s travelling companions joked about posessing sewing needles while on line at the airport, and security arrived within seconds of her saying that!</p>

		<p>what happened probably was due to powders inside expanding due to static heat?</p>
<p>kinda like the explosions you get in a flour factory..</p>

		<p>Do not put a laptop in your checked luggage if you&#8217;re visiting the US.  If security goons find it they&#8217;ll break it open, just like they break open anything else that looks like luggage if it&#8217;s locked or if they can&#8217;t find a zipper on it.  If you need to bring files, burn a CD.</p>

		<p>I just went through this stupidity flying down to Orlando for teched.  They took my lighter&#8230; my 99cent, 2 inch high bic lighter.  However, they let me keep half a dozen books of matches.  Im not understanding the logic here&#8230;  am I going to use the lighter for a bomb?  Why then are the matches safe?</p>
<p>I should have known better though, last time I flew I lost my mini swiss army keychain knife ( damn I miss that thing, bloody handy I tell you ).  Atleast that argument makes a mediocum of sense ( well did, before steak knives were allowed again&#8230; ).</p>
<p>Really, how long until we have to check our laptops?  Really, isnt the battery inside a laptop more potentially dangerous then a pocket knife, or mini bic lighter?  Hell, I would imagine any form of electronics would be potentially more dangerous on a plane then the majority of items that are being banned lately.</p>
<p>*sigh*  Got love over-reacting.</p>

		<p>I would be surprised if they do not crack down on LiIon batteries. Even the small batteries used in cellphones shows signs of impressive forces &#8212; now add to that the LiIon battery in your laptop&#8230;</p>
<p>I predict that this will happen the minute someone brings a safer and better battery to the mainstream market. :) (maybe there are already regulations on this, but just not enforced?)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
