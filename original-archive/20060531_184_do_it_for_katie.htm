<p>A story in honor of Katie Couric's final day at the <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/today_front.asp"> <i>Today</i></a> show.</p>
<p> Last month I happened to run into a former member of the shell team who worked on the Windows&nbsp;XP Welcome screen. He told me a story from CES&nbsp;2001, where Windows&nbsp;XP's interface (code-named Luna) was unveiled. There was going to be a segment on the <i>Today</i> show, and the Welcome screen was going to make an appearance, but the designers wanted to make one last tweak before it showed up on national television. </p>
<p> Two hours before air time. </p>
<p> So with a hard deadline of two hours, my colleague connected back to the computer at the office, made the requested changes, compiled a new binary, transferred it back to Las Vegas, installed it onto a laptop, and handed it over to the production crew. Everybody crossed their fingers. </p>
<p> It worked. </p>
<p> They did it for Katie. </p>

<p>I<br />
  completely disagree with your statement, explaining the change made by<br />
  your colleague is critical to the post. &nbsp;In fact, your title is<br />
  &#8220;Do IT for Katie,&#8221; yet at the end of the story we do not know what IT<br />
  is? &nbsp;(Is IT something invented by Dean Kamen :) ) &nbsp;You state<br />
  all the steps that your colleague had to do within 2 hours, yet we have<br />
  no idea what change had to be made, thereby diminishing the time<br />
  crunch/pressure he was under to get the change done. &nbsp;For all we<br />
  know your colleague may have created a new user called &#8220;Katie Couric of<br />
  the Today Show&#8221; or added the Today Show logo for the user icon, which<br />
  is not that impressive. &nbsp;On the other hand if you collegue had to<br />
  right a bunch of code so the Welcome screen would work in a desired way<br />
  on national tv that is much more impressive. </p>
<p>Here are 2<br />
  examples of a story many of you are probably familar with, one which is<br />
  descriptive and one that removes relevant information. &nbsp; </p>
<p>The<br />
  night before Allen was to fly down Gates stayed up all night checking<br />
  the code before making the paper tape. The next morning Allen flew to<br />
  Albuquerque and realized in mid-flight that a change had to be made .<br />
  Allen made the change in machine code on the flight down. </p>
<p>The<br />
  night before Allen was to fly down Gates stayed up all night checking<br />
  the code before making the paper tape. The next morning Allen flew to<br />
  Albuquerque and realized in mid-flight that he did not have a loader<br />
  (the software to make the Altair talk to the teletype so the paper tape<br />
  with the BASIC could be put into the computer). Allen wrote the loader<br />
  in machine code on the flight down. </p>
<p>The second version is more<br />
  informative and enjoyable for someone to read. &nbsp;Letting the reader<br />
  know the changes Allen had to make on the flight is much more dramatic<br />
  then just &nbsp;saying he had to make some &#8220;changes&#8221;.</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>It was<br />
  obviously something that required code changes. (Adding a new<br />
  user/picture doesn&#8217;t require code changes. You did it when you created<br />
  your account after all and you didn&#8217;t need to recompile Windows to do<br />
  it.) And given that it was for television, I would guess that it was<br />
  something visual. Changing the layout of the screen elements or adding<br />
  a new element. But it&#8217;s not important what the change was. There is a<br />
  baseline risk level for any change, no matter how small, and that<br />
  baseline risk level easily exceeds two hours. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I heard about this!</p>
<p>If, while looking at the Welcome screen, you cross your eyes, squint, and do the &quot;Magic Eye&quot; (TM) trick, a picture of Katie&#8217;s face pops out at you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just what I heard anyway.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time, Katherine Couric was on the D.C. area local news. She was smart, aggressive, and focused. I liked her. </p>
<p>Then she went to the Today show, where she became *Katie* Couric. She was giggly, gushy, and annoying. I didn&#8217;t like her at all. </p>
<p>I like to think she&#8217;s still smart, aggressive, and focused off-camera. Then, at the very least, I don&#8217;t lose respect for her altogether.<br /></p>

		<p>For those of you complaining about Luna, I&#8217;m sure you are aching to go back to the original Win95 interface. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;m not. &nbsp;Luna is far easier on the eyes and much more pleasant to work with than previous versions.</p>

		<p>God I can&#8217;t stand Luna. &nbsp;I called it &quot;Disney Mode&quot; until someone told me the better name &quot;Playskool Mode&quot;. &nbsp;First thing I do on a new logon or new account is switch to Windows Classic.</p>
<p>I like the Windows Vista glass look, but it&#8217;s *such* a resource hog.</p>

		<p>James:</p>
<p>Luna gives me a headache, I think because of the very bright colors and the contrast. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m aching for the classic interface, but it sure beats getting a headache while using the computer 8-14 hours a day.</p>
<p>I guess all that really means, is that it&#8217;s pretty silly to make a broad assertion that &quot;Luna is far easier on the eyes&quot; when you really only mean it&#8217;s far easier on &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; eyes.</p>

		<p>Actually, if I could go back to the NT 3.51 theme on XP I would instantly. At the very least I try to keep all my XP boxes with the classic theme and no gradients animation. </p>
<p>Its not that I care about the performance but the &quot;flash&quot; just seems to annoy me.<br /></p>

		<p>Is there some way to set winlogon/msgina to use Windows Classic? &nbsp;I found the flag in the registry to disable luna, but that doesn&#8217;t affect the feature sizes and the fonts&#8230;</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t mind Luna &#8211; but only after I change it from Blue to Silver &#8211; much nicer.</p>
<p>Though lately, I installed the Media Center theme (Royale?) on my XP machine, and while blue, the slightly-glassy look-and-feel makes it decent, as well.</p>
<p>I still find Vista *vastly* improved, of course &#8211; but as was said earlier, here&#8217;s hoping the resource consumption improves between now and RTM&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
