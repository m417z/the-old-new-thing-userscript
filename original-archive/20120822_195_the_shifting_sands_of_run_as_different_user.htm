<p>A customer liaison asked the following question on behalf of his customer.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  When I do a shift-right-click on a shortcut to a program, I see the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows Server 2008, shift-right-click does not offer     the option <i>Run as different user</i>. </li>
<li>On Windows&nbsp;7, shift-right-click does offer the     option <i>Run as different user</i>. 
<p>On Windows Server 2008&nbsp;R2 (the server counterpart     to Windows&nbsp;7),  shift-right-click does offer the     option <i>Run as different user</i>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> The option to run a program as another user (other than Administrator) was present in Windows&nbsp;XP, but it was lost in Windows&nbsp;Vista. It appears that we responded to those complaints by restoring the functionality in Windows&nbsp;7. </p>
<p> Is that right? </p>
<p> The odd thing is that my customer has the <i>Run as different user</i> option available on their Windows&nbsp;7 machines, but not on their Windows Server 2008&nbsp;R2 machines. Does whether you have access to <i>Run as different user</i> depend on how you installed Windows Server 2008&nbsp;R2? (If it matters, my customer installed it via the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/solutionaccelerators/dd407791"> Microsoft Deployment Toolkit</a>.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I found this question interesting for a variety of reasons. </p>
<p> First of all, it comes dangerously close to being one of those <i>Please tell me I'm not hallucinating</i> type of requests. These support requests take the following peculiar form: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> We did X, then Y, then Z, and then Q happened. Is that right? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> "Um, if you say so. I wasn't there." </p>
<p> But in this case, it started out looking like it was going to turn into a <i>Please tell me I'm not hallucinating</i> request, then veered into "Is X the reason the feature was added back?" </p>
<p> This is a rather peculiar question, because knowing the answer one way or the other doesn't actually take you any closer to a solution to the problem. (And I don't know the answer, but fortunately, it wasn't relevant to solving the customer's problem.) </p>
<p> Another interesting thing about the customer's question is that he <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/03/15/1883515.aspx"> never actually comes out and asks the question</a>. He sort of says a few related things, and asks a tangential question, but never comes right out and asks, "How do I get the <i>Run as different user</i> option to work on my Windows Server 2008&nbsp;R2 machine?" </p>
<p> It's like a kid who pointedly hangs around a candy bowl, hoping that an adult will say, "Here, have a piece of candy." </p>
<p> You're a grown-up now. You don't have to linger around the candy bowl hoping somebody will figure out that you want some candy. You should just ask, "May I have a piece of candy?" </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> My psychic powers tell me that they have <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/04/19/10295140.aspx"> set</a> the <i>Require trusted path for credential entry</i> policy. The <i>Run as different user</i> feature is disabled if you set this policy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The customer liaison replied, "It appears that the option for <i>Require trusted path for credential entry</i> is not enabled.  The customer is going to do a clean install and test on a non-domain-joined machine to avoid any GPOs." </p>
<p> Some time passed, and the customer liaison reported back with a resolution. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The culprit was indeed the <i>Require trusted path for credential entry</i> policy. It didn't show up in a <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc739947"> GPO search</a> because they were setting the policy via a script rather than deploying a group policy object. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> It was very nice of the customer liaison to reply with confirmation that the problem was solved. This is, unfortunately, a notable event. Most of the time, people never report back if your suggestion solved their program; they only come back if your suggestion didn't help. Which means you're not sure if your suggestion solved the problem, or if it didn't solve the problem but they decided to continue the investigation somewhere else. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: This shows yet another reason why you should use Group Policy Objects to manage group policies rather than custom scripts that whack registry keys. In addition to the fact that registry key whacking may not work, there are tools for processing Group Policy Objects that make this sort of investigation much easier. </p>

		<p>There is a much bigger issue with the runas verb; when UAC is off it does not revert back to the NT5 UI so if you are using the verb programmatically to elevate you need to be prepared for this and check in the child process that you really are elevated&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#39;m trying to decide whether making the Server 2008 R2 behavior a &lt;P&gt; instead of an &lt;LI&gt; was intentional. &nbsp;The &lt;LI&gt; makes sense because they&#39;re three different OSes. &nbsp;But the &lt;P&gt; could also make sense because Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are more closely related than Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s more like:</p>
<p>We did X, then Y, then Z, and then Q happened. This leads us to theory A. Is that right? Or maybe we&#39;re not, and W affects Q as well?</p>
<p>Which is a reasonable question IMO.</p>

		<p>The customer&#39;s question &quot;Is that right?&quot;, which attracted your flippant &quot;Um, if you say so; I wasn&#39;t there&quot;, was surely intended to mean &quot;Is that to be expected?&quot;. &nbsp;I also suspect that the &#39;beating around the bush&#39;, which you seem to consider childish, is a cultural thing; it&#39;s exactly the way I would be likely to phrase it (I&#39;m from the UK).</p>

		<p>A literal answer (such as Yes or No) is possible but not helpful. &nbsp;I read &quot;Is this right?&quot; as &quot;Was the feature added back because of customer complaints?&quot; instead of &quot;Is this expected?&quot;. &nbsp;The answer to the customer liaison could be &quot;Yes, the feature was added back to Windows 7 because of customer complaints&quot; or &quot;No, the feature was added back to Windows 7 because we decided it should be there&quot;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>(MS doesn&#39;t have to say &quot;I don&#39;t know; I wasn&#39;t there&quot;; MS should know whether the behavior is expected.)</p>
<p>And then you can answer the CL&#39;s other question with &quot;No, whether this appears does not depend on how you installed Windows Server 2008 R2&quot;.</p>
<p>Neither one of those answers gives what the customer really wanted to know, of course.</p>

		<p>@Richard Russell</p>
<p>Whether the question is &quot;is that right?&quot; or &quot;is that expected?&quot;, it&#39;s still a poor question. A good question is &quot;I am trying to do X and I&#39;m hitting problem Y, how can I do X?&quot;. If you are requesting tech-support via email, you are not starting a conversation. A conversation this way could take weeks and waste everyone&#39;s time. To get the best result, you need to be precise about what you are trying to achieve, what problems you are hitting, and any and all contextual information that you can provide (whether or not you think it will be relevant). &quot;Beating around the bush&quot; is not childish, it is ineffective. It wastes everyone&#39;s time forcing the support person to try and &quot;guess&quot; at the problem. If UK culture causes this issue, then it&#39;s something you need to address as an engineer, because it is simply un-workable in this medium.</p>

		<p>@Jonathan: &gt; Which is a reasonable question IMO.</p>
<p>Right. And a customer is like a kid which looks at an empty bowl and asks: &quot;I suppose we&#39;re out of candies today, aren&#39;t we?&quot; It&#39;s not like they&#39;re afraid to ask for candies. They might just think it would be stupid to ask for candy when there are clearly none in the bowl.</p>

		<p>@Raphael: &#39;Trusted path&#39; here means &#39;use the secure desktop&#39;, that special place where only SYSTEM can create windows (and therefore shatter attacks are not possible). My assumption is that Windows 7 doesn&#39;t implement the general collection of credentials for a different user under the secure desktop. It can clearly do so for over-the-shoulder elevation requests from UAC, when a standard user runs a program marked requiresAdministrator, so this seems like an omission. CredUIPromptForWindowsCredentials supports the CREDUIWIN_SECURE_PROMPT flag to create the dialog on the secure desktop.</p>
<p>Windows 7 now allows you to use Fast User Switching when on a domain, so if your administrator has set the policy, just hit Ctrl+Alt+Del, select Switch User, then log in as the other user account. Of course that will load the profile, the user&#39;s desktop, etc.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could change your user account to be a standard user, rather than an administrator, and then the regular elevation prompt will do what you want. Or, it&#39;s possible to configure UAC to prompt for username and password even for administrators. Set the policy &quot;User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode&quot; to &quot;Prompt for credentials&quot;. I admit I don&#39;t know whose token is then used to run the program, if you enter different credentials: the user whose desktop is shown, or the user whose credentials were entered!</p>

		<p>The customer will almost always ask why something was changed. &nbsp;The rep needs to ask, because otherwise it becomes &quot;Microsoft sucks&quot; afterwards. &nbsp;Also the last three major companies/organizations I&#39;ve worked at had a hide/disable nothing policy. &nbsp;Instead, you leave an option like this enabled, and display &quot;I can&#39;t do that because of policy whatever.&quot;. Users do complain, but it measurably reduces support calls.</p>
<p>Displaying the option disabled and placing a tooltip saying why would be a similar approach. &nbsp;The idea is that if you tell the user why they can&#39;t do something, then they won&#39;t call asking.</p>
<p>I would see run as as a good candidate for that. &nbsp;Just always return true, and then when user picks it, tell them why it doesn&#39;t work. &nbsp;You don&#39;t hide an app because it&#39;s deny execute, and this is parallel to that.</p>
<p>Should make the shell faster, too. &nbsp;No more testing policy before displaying a verb.</p>

		<p>This still raises the question of *why* runas is disabled when Trusted Path is enabled.</p>
<p>Also, what valid reasons are there to disable UAC?</p>

		<p>@Raphiel: Also, what valid reasons are there to disable UAC?</p>
<p>Easy. UAC is incompatible with runas /netonly as elevation loses the explicitly loaded network credentials.</p>

		<p>@Raphael</p>
<p>In our organization, admins and users are strictly separate. Users have restricted accounts, and admins log into an account with administrative rights whenever they need to install or update something (they have restricted accounts for testing purposes and internet browsing, too). UAC is simply not needed, and a hassle for the admins.</p>

		<p>@Sean: &nbsp;A &quot;hassle&quot; perhaps, but also a useful safeguard. &nbsp;Are you doing administrator-like things 100% of the time that you are logged in? &nbsp;Probably not, and so UAC prevents the non-administrator tasks from doing administrative things without your authorization. &nbsp;Probably that&#39;s the entire reason why UAC was added in the first place.</p>

		<p>@JamesJohnston</p>
<p>Because UAC is sometimes too helpful to elevate setup programs even when elevation is not needed. So instead of figuring out where the setup programs write to and writing RunAsInvoker/ADDREDIRECT myself, turning off UAC and letting Windows redirect registry locations is much easier.</p>

		<p>And good luck writing compatibility shims for msi installers that are extracted with random name at runtime, AND dependent on being passed handle or some such values from the main stub.</p>

		<p>You don&#39;t need to disable UAC to run setup programs AsInvoker. &nbsp;There&#39;s a separate policy to disable elevation of files named in a way suggestive of installers.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
