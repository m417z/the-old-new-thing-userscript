<p>
A customer had some code that called the
<code>Reg&shy;Open&shy;Key</code> function
and was concerned by the remark in MSDN:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
<b>Note</b>  This function is provided only for compatibility with
16-bit versions of Windows.
Applications should use the <b>RegOpenKeyEx</b> function.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What are the dire consequences of using this old function
instead of the new one?
</p>
<p>
In general, not much.
</p>
<p>
If you call <code>Reg&shy;Open&shy;Key</code>,
then some compatibility stuff kicks in,
and then it goes ahead and
behaves as if
you had called <code>Reg&shy;Open&shy;Key&shy;Ex</code>.
</p>
<p>
In the specific case of
<code>Reg&shy;Open&shy;Key</code>,
the compatibility stuff is
mentioned in the parameter documentation of
<code>Reg&shy;Open&shy;Key</code>:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
<i>lpSubKey</i>:
If this parameter is <b>NULL</b> or a pointer to an empty string,
the function returns the same handle that was passed in.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is different from <code>Reg&shy;Open&shy;Key&shy;Ex</code>,
which always returns a new key.
It means that if you pass <code>NULL</code> as the
<code>lpSub&shy;Key</code>,
then the returned registry key is the same as the one that you passed
in,
and therefore it does <i>not</i> create a new obligation to call
<code>Reg&shy;Close&shy;Key</code>.
In other words, this code has a potential bug:
</p>
<pre>
void DoSomething(HKEY hkey, PCSTR subkeyName)
{
  HKEY subkey;
  if (RegOpenKey(hkey, subkeyName, &amp;subkey) == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
    // do something
    RegCloseKey(subkey);
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
The bug occurs if <code>subkeyName</code> is <code>NULL</code> or
<code>""</code>.
In that case, the special
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/17/7137438.aspx">
16-bit compatibility behavior</a> kicks in,
and <code>subkey</code> is set to a copy of <code>hkey</code>.
This means that when you do
<code>Reg&shy;Close&shy;Key(subkey)</code>,
you are <i>closing the original <code>hkey</code></i>,
and the caller will probably be rather upset that you
closed a key out from under it.
</p>
<p>
If you know that <code>subkeyName</code> is never
<code>NULL</code> or
<code>""</code>,
then you can safely close the key.
Otherwise, you either need to check against this special case
or (better)
just switch to
<code>Reg&shy;Open&shy;Key&shy;Ex</code>
so you don't have to deal with the special case in the first place.</p>

		<p>I wonder what the use-case scenario was in 16-bit Windows for the RegOpenKey function to behave like that.</p>

		<p>As noted in the linked article, Win16 had a different handle model.</p>

		<p>For compatibility functions like that, it would be cool if the equivalence with the new function was stated more explicitly, preferentially in source code form. Something like:</p>
<p>{<br />
  if (lpSubKey == NULL || lpSubKey[0] == &#8221;) {<br />
    *phkResult = hKey;<br />
    return ERROR_SUCCESS;<br />
  }<br />
  return RegOpenKeyEx(&#8230;);<br />
}</p>
<p>That would make special compatibility cases obvious, and also would show what to pass to the new function if you want it to behave like the old function for the normal cases.</p>

		<p>I seem to recall that the Ex version might not always give you a new handle on Win9x. If you want to make your own (working) version of shlwapi!SHRegDuplicateHKey you have to do something special?</p>

		<p>I bet it wasn&#8217;t, but one could have made a case to drop Reg­Open­Key completely from the 64-bit version of Advapi32.dll.</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
