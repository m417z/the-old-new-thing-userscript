MontagFTB had a problem which, upon investigation, allegedly was caused by
a subtle "fact":
"<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#925651"
>The parent specified in <code>CreateWindowEx</code>
is both the parent of the window and the owner of the window</a>,
but when you call <code>SetParent</code> it only sets the parent of the window,
not the owner."
MontagFTB then concluded that some messages were sent to the parent
and others were sent to the owner.
</p>
<p>
This is a faulty diagnosis.
We'll look at the correct diagnosis next time,
but today's topic is parents and owners.
Actually,
parent and owner windows were already covered by my 2005 PDC talk,
<i>Five Things Every Win32 Programmer Should Know</i>,
so for most of you, today's topic is a review.
(And I included the topic in the talk specifically
so I wouldn't have to blog about it,
but obviously that plan didn't work out.)
</p>
<p>
A window can be created as a child window (<code>WS_CHILD</code> set)
or a top-level window (<code>WS_CHILD</code> not set).
A child window has a parent, which you specify
when you call <code>CreateWindowEx</code>,
and which you can change by calling <code>SetParent</code>.
A top-level window, on the other hand, has no parent.
Its parent is <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
<p>
Ownership is a concept that relates top-level windows.
A top-level window can optionally have an owner,
which is also specified when you call <code>CreateWindowEx</code>,
and which you can change by a complicated mechanism described
in my talk.
</p>
<p>
Note that changing a window's parent or owner is not a normal
operation.
You usually create a window with a specific parent or owner and
leave it that way for the lifetime of the window.
</p>
<p>
Now, a window can have a parent,
or it can have an owner, or it can have neither,
but it can never have both.
</p>
<p>
What would it mean for a window to have both a parent and an owner?
Well, in order to have a parent, the window must itself be a child.
But in order to have an owner, the window must be top-level.
And top-level windows and child windows are mutually exclusive
(and collectively exhaustive),
because you either have the <code>WS_CHILD</code> style
(which makes you a child) or you don't (which makes you top-level).
Since people like tables so much, here's a table:
</p>
<table BORDER=1>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Child window</th>
<th>Top-level window</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>The Parent window is...</th>
<td>non-<code>NULL</code></td>
<td><code>NULL</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>The Owner window is...</th>
<td>N/A</td>
<td><code>NULL</code> or non-<code>NULL</code></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The box for "The Owner window of a Child window..." is marked N/A
because the question is meaningless.
Ownership is a relationship among top-level windows.
</p>
<p>
By analogy, consider the people at a school for children.
They can be separated into two groups,
students and teachers.
(We'll treat non-teaching staff as teachers with no students.)
</p>
<p>
Each student is assigned to a teacher.
Each teacher might or might not have another teacher as a mentor.
Several students can be assigned the same teacher,
but every student must be assigned to some teacher.
Similarly, several teachers might have the same mentor,
but some teachers won't have a mentor at all,
and some mentors might themselves have mentors.
</p>
<p>
It's impossible for a person to have both a teacher and a mentor,
because having a teacher applies only to students,
and having a mentor applies only to teachers.
Teachers don't attend classes (they <i>lead</i> the classes)
so they don't have a teacher.
But they might have mentors.
Asking for a student's mentor is a meaningless question because
students don't have mentors; teachers do.
</p>
<p>
Since a window cannot have both a parent and an owner,
the <code>CreateWindowEx</code> function takes a single
<code>HWND</code> parameter which is either the parent or owner
of the window being created, depending on what type of window
you're creating.
If you're creating a child window, then the parameter represents
the parent window;
if you're creating a top-level window, then the parameter represents
the owner window.
</p>
<p>
A similar overloading of parameters happens with the <code>HMENU</code>:
If you're creating a child window, then the parameter represents the
child window identifier;
if you're creating a top-level window, then the parameter represents
the window menu.
Because only top-level windows can have menus,
and only child windows can have child window identifiers.
</p>
<p>
If this parameter overloading
bothers you, you can write your own helper functions:
</p>
<pre>
HWND CreateChildWindowEx(
    DWORD dwExStyle,
    LPCTSTR lpClassName,
    LPCTSTR lpWindowName,
    DWORD dwStyle,
    int x,
    int y,
    int nWidth,
    int nHeight,
    HWND hWndParent,
    UINT_PTR id,
    HINSTANCE hInstance,
    LPVOID lpParam
)
{
 // A child window must have the WS_CHILD style
 if (!(dwStyle &amp; WS_CHILD)) {
  SetLastError(ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER);
  return NULL;
 }
 return CreateWindowEx(
    dwExStyle,
    lpClassName,
    lpWindowName,
    dwStyle,
    x,
    y,
    nWidth,
    nHeight,
    hWndParent,
    reinterpret_cast&lt;HMENU&gt;(id),
    hInstance,
    lpParam);
}

HWND CreateTopLevelWindowEx(
    DWORD dwExStyle,
    LPCTSTR lpClassName,
    LPCTSTR lpWindowName,
    DWORD dwStyle,
    int x,
    int y,
    int nWidth,
    int nHeight,
    HWND hWndOwner,
    HMENU hMenu,
    HINSTANCE hInstance,
    LPVOID lpParam
)
{
 // A top-level window must not have the WS_CHILD style
 if (dwStyle &amp; WS_CHILD) {
  SetLastError(ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER);
  return NULL;
 }
 return CreateWindowEx(
    dwExStyle,
    lpClassName,
    lpWindowName,
    dwStyle,
    x,
    y,
    nWidth,
    nHeight,
    hWndOwner,
    hMenu,
    hInstance,
    lpParam);
}
</pre>
<p>
There's more to parent windows and owner windows than what I've
written here; I refer you to my talk (or other documentation)
for more details.

		<p>Thanks for describing this so concisely. &nbsp;The MSDN documentation is&#8211;in places&#8211;pretty vague about the distinction between owners and parents.</p>
<p>When I interviewed with Microsoft several years ago, one of my interviewers specifically asked how to create a window with both and owner and a parent that were different.</p>
<p>I said that I didn&#8217;t think it was possible, though my reasoning wasn&#8217;t as crisp as described here.</p>
<p>The interviewer then went on to explain that it was possible and that he had recently used the trick in a product. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not sure I remember the details exactly right, but it went something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Create a top-level window with the desired owner.</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;After creation, add WS_CHILD to turn it into a child window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Use SetParent to re-parent the window, which supposedly leaves the owner alone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea was that the window would be rendered in the client area of its parent window, but that it would send notification messages to the owner (which was a different top-level window in the same process).</p>
<p>I was dubious, but I didn&#8217;t argue. &nbsp;Raymond&#8217;s explanation sounds much more plausible.</p>

		<p>IIRC, the combobox dropdown list is a top level window with WS_CHILD (To allow it to extend outside the parent while not causing titlebar focus issues I&#8217;m guessing (WS_EX_NOACTIVATE was added to 2000))</p>

		<p>The story is complicated even more with developing for MDI. I was just supporting old code base from 1998 (MFC, MDI) and to my surprise when MDI Child window is an owner of a modal dialog (its HWND is passed into DialogBoxParam) &#8211; when GetOwner is used in WM_INITDIALOG &#8211; it returns the HWND of MDI Frame (not MDI Child)! So, the pointers taken by GetWindowLong of these HWNDs are also wrong. I had a lot of fun debugging this.</p>

		<p>Hmmm. There&#8217;s one more bizarre corner case I encountered and abused for awhile.</p>
<p>Calling SetParent() on a window that doesn&#8217;t have WS_CHILD makes it into a child window as far as composting goes but the rest of the system doesn&#8217;t seem to know about it.</p>
<p>The primary effect is clicking on the child window steals activation from the parent window and Alt+PrntScrn grabs only the child window.</p>
<p>I used it for its secondary effect of working around third-party library code that assumed the .NET Framework&#8217;s view of the window chain matched the native version (it doesn&#8217;t always) until I was able to actually fix the bug in the third party library code.</p>
<p>This particular behavior seems bloody useful if somebody ever wants to write a UNIX-style window manager to accomplish something that custom themes just can&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>I think the most common case where the &quot;parent window&quot; and the &quot;window that get the notification messages&quot; differ is for toolbar controls. You can have one window be the parent, and another to be the &quot;toolbar parent&quot; (set with TB_SETPARENT message).</p>

<p>For example, let&#8217;s build the window, that has owner and parent (and let&#8217;s owner=parent):</p>
<p>1) run ParentOwner.exe</p>
<p>2) push &quot;CreateWindowEx&quot; button (=&gt; Window 1)</p>
<p>3) push &quot;sWaP&quot; button</p>
<p>4) push &quot;CreateWindowEx&quot; button (=&gt; Window 2)</p>
<p>5) push &nbsp;&quot;SetParent&quot; button</p>
<p>Our result &#8211; Window 2 (its owner=parent &#8211; Window 1).</p>

		<p>Hmmm&#8230;.OK. But why the distinction between the two heirarchies? Why have both &#8220;parents&#8221; and &#8220;owners&#8221; if a window can have at most one? Why not just have a single &#8220;progenitor&#8221; window. If a &#8220;pup&#8221; window has a progenitor, then if it has WS_CHILD it&#8217;s a parented child, and if it does not have WS_CHILD then it&#8217;s an owned top-level window?</p>
<p>Also, I suppose it&#8217;s a violation of the assumption that &#8220;programmers are assumed to know what they&#8217;re doing&#8221;, and would have taken up precious processor cycles back when Windows was first written, but shouldn&#8217;t the Windows API prevent these sorts of &#8220;invariants&#8221; from being violated in the first place by having SetParent() fail when called for a top-level window?</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a bit of historical context missing here.</p>
<p>The real reason that the owner window and parent window are not separated in the API was to save space in the USER heap in 16-bit Windows. The owner and parent window handles occupied the same field in the USER heap entry for a window, and the WS_CHILD flag told which way to interpret that handle. Similarly, the hMenu and window ID occupied a single field and WS_CHILD also told which way to interpret that field.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all it ever was, a space-saving hack.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing inherent in the concepts of parent and owner that says a window should be able to have only one or the other. OS/2 Presentation Manager separated the two and allowed you to specify parent and owner windows independently for any window. The parent window is the one that a window is drawn inside of, and the owner window is the one that receives notification messages.</p>
<p>The teacher/student/mentor analogy is misleading. Child windows are not students, parent windows are not teachers, and owner windows are not mentors. Asserting that a student can&#8217;t have a mentor tells us nothing about the relationships among windows.</p>
<p>(Sorry to disagree on some of the details, Raymond &#8211; your post does an excellent job of explaining how these things work, but not *why* they work this way.)</p>

		<p>The funniest thing about this discussion is apparently MontagFTB had to wait over 3 years for his problem to work its way to the top of the suggestion box.</p>
<p>I would hope that he has given up way prior to this and re-architected the problem/solution.</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
