A customer reported that the translucent preview shows by
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/03/17/designing-aero-snap.aspx">
Aero Snap</a>
showed the wrong dimensions for their application window.
"As you can see in the screen shot, the preview is too wide.
Our application window has a maximum width,
but the preview is fully half the width of the screen.
How can we disable the Aero Snap feature?"
</p>
<p>
Whoa there,
giving up so easily?
Sounds like you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
</p>
<p>
To control the size of the preview window used by Aero Snap,
you respond to the same message you've already been responding
to in order to tell Windows the valid range of sizes for your
window:
<code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;MIN&shy;MAX&shy;INFO</wbr></code>.
</p>
<p>
Start with our
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
scratch program</a>
and make the following changes:
</p>
<pre>
void OnGetMinMaxInfo(HWND hwnd, LPMINMAXINFO pmmi)
{
  pmmi-&gt;ptMaxTrackSize.x = 400;
}

// add to WndProc
    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_GETMINMAXINFO, OnGetMinMaxInfo);
</pre>
<p>
We specify in the <code>On&shy;Get&shy;Min&shy;Max&shy;Info</code>
function that
the maximum width for the window is 400&nbsp;pixels.
(In real life, of course, you wouldn't hard-code the width,
but this is just a proof of concept program.)
Since we don't touch <code>ptMaxTrackSize.y</code>,
we impose no additional constraints on the window height
beyond what comes with Windows by default.
</p>
<p>
Run this program, and use Aero Snap to shove it against the
edges of the screen.
Observe that the Aero Snap preview respects our maximum
window width.
</p>
<p>
I never heard back from the customer, so I assume this simple
solution worked for them.
The fact that they had to ask this question tells me that
they hadn't been handling the <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;MIN&shy;MAX&shy;INFO</wbr></code>
message
at all;
instead, they were enforcing their window size procedurally
after the window manager already decided on the wrong size.
Either they didn't seem to mind that the maximize and restore
animations showed the window animating to the wrong size,
or they couldn't figure out how to fix that problem either.</p>

		<p>Actually having most QA machines with non-default and varying settings smokes out more bugs than otherwise.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: Yes, but they should have at least *one* machine with default settings, and run their QA there first.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re trying to be clever or what, but excusing the bug with &quot;well maybe they turned off a Windows feature which is really hard to find and 99.9% of people will never turn off!&quot; isn&#39;t a very compelling argument to me. Sure, &quot;some people do.&quot; How likely are you to run into a single one of those people during your entire career?</p>
<p>It&#39;s a bug.</p>

		<p>It also requires people to look out for such things. When you&#39;re testing, either minimize/maximize isn&#39;t tested explicitly, or no one bothers noticing the issue.</p>
<p>And after testing the same program on the Nth PC, they probably click, see result, done. You&#39;re expecting a level of detail which may simply not exist. If it&#39;s a bespoke app, if it works that&#39;s good enough. If it&#39;s a specialty app, ditto.</p>
<p>As the app gets used by less and less people and costs more and more, polish goes way down. Specialy apps often do things that would make you cringe</p>

		<p>The first, and last, time I cared about WM_GETMINMAXINFO I discovered that it got sent before WM_CREATE which meant that the answer was &quot;I have no idea&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>Last week I just found a component we&#39;ve been using for years won&#39;t work (hangs) on Remote Desktop.</p>
<p>We surely have QA, but test cases are usually designed to cover the functionality we&#39;re required to work out (business logic, etc.), often just cover little on the UI section, and usually do not cover any item in &quot;Windows behaviour&quot; region.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
