The end is near for the original Microsoft Redmond campus.
The nine buildings that formed the original campus
are slated for demolition to make way for a new campus
redesign.
The buildings are making a final farewell tour this month,
and last week,
<a HREF="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-alumni-play-one-last-game-of-hallway-putt-putt-before-demolition/">
former Microsoft employees were invited back for one last
hurrah in Building 2</a>.

Not mentioned in the article is a sign posted in the front door
of the building:

		<p>They&#8217;re currently in the planning stages for rehousing my organization&#8217;s Leeds (UK) offices (we&#8217;re currently spread across four different buildings all in the city centre). As part of this, a survey was sent out to try to get opinions on how well the current offices work for different types of workloads, and the final page of the survey asked us to identify general positives and negatives of our current building.</p>
<p>Best I could come up with for my current building for a general positive was &#8220;When you&#8217;re inside it, you can&#8217;t see what the outside of this building looks like&#8221;. I know other people came up with &#8220;it&#8217;s a well-known eyesore so directing out of town visitors to it is quite easy&#8221;. It&#8217;s not a well-loved building, in my experience.</p>
<p>I assume the conference rooms there were similarly (in)famous?</p>

		<p>The building layout was non-rectangular, and people often ended up walking in circles trying to find their conference room. Personally, I found it wasn&#8217;t so bad once you learned the building layout, but there was also that conference room that didn&#8217;t fit the pattern and was tucked in a easily-overlooked corner. I could never find that conference room when I needed to.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m sure that the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/step-inside-microsoft-archives-and-see-past-your-favorite-company" rel="nofollow">Microsoft archives</a> have been safely moved.

		<p>Maybe I&#8217;m too sentimental, but before demolition I think it&#8217;s nice to bring streetview in to important buildings</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/buildings/tvc-streetview" rel="nofollow">https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/buildings/tvc-streetview</a></p>
<p>Politically that might be tricky though.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
