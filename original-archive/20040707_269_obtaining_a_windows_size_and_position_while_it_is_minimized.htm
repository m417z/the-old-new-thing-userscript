<p>If you have a minimized window and want to know where it will  go when you restore it,  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/Windows/WindowReference/WindowFunctions/GetWindowPlacement.asp">  the GetWindowPlacement function</a> will tell you.  In particular, the <code>rcNormalPosition</code> tells you where  the window would go if it were restored (as opposed to minimized or  maximized).</p>
<p>  One perhaps-non-obvious flag is WPF_RESTORETOMAXIMIZED.  This flag indicates that the window is currently minimized, but if  the user selects "Restore", it will restore to its maximized instead  of restored state.  (This may seem strange, but you see it every day without  even realizing.  Take a window and maximize it. Now minimize it.  Now click the taskbar button to re-open the window.  Notice that  it returns to its maximized state, not to its restored state.  Imagine how frustrated you would be if it returned to its restored  state instead.  You'd have to keep re-maximizing the window.)  </p>
<p>  The GetWindowPlacement and SetWindowPlacement functions are  typically used by programs that wish to save/restore window  positioning information across runs.  </p>
<p>  You should also be aware that  the coordinate system for window placement is  <strong>not</strong> screen coordinates, but rather  workspace coordinates.  <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/12/54896.aspx">  The consequence of getting this wrong is that your window  creeps up (or to the left) over time, eventually getting itself  stuck underneath the taskbar</a>.  </p>

		<p>Sort of related(ish) &#8212; I keep my taskbar at the top of the screen, and if an app is in a &quot;not responding&quot; state and is minimised then restored, it ends up under the taskbar and with a blank area at the bottom, and you can move it about.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you move the app while it&#8217;s thinking then when it starts responding again it tends to get a bit confused as to where it is on the screen.  Restoring then maximising usually results in it being in a fixed position somewhere off-centre&#8230;</p>
<p>(And anyone who has a taskbar at the top may want to look at &quot;Y&#8217;z Shadow&quot; &#8212; it adds a nice dropshadow effect to windows, which is its main purpose, but it will also move any apps that try and stick themselves under the taskbar.)</p>

		<p>A question that I asked myself a long time: How does the window manager minimizes a window? As far as I can see all the the window mangager does is moving the window to the location (-32000; -32000) so it is entirely out of view. Is that right?</p>

		<p>I love Get/SetWindowPlacement.  You can pretty much just stream all of the results to make your app start just like it ended.</p>
<p>Is there any plans for a Get/SetWPEx to deal with multimon?  It would be nice if it remembered both the layout of the window AND the original resolutions of the monitors to make intelligent decisions on how to restore the window after monitors have been moved and/or screen resolutions have been changed.  I know an app can do this, but it&#8217;s something done often enough that it might be nice for Windows.</p>

		<p>&quot;Workspace coordinates&quot;, new word for me!</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I once coded a Messenger style popup window and had to FindWindow() the taskbar and then do some math to correctly position the popup.</p>
<p>Is there some easier way to convert between workspace and screen coordinates?</p>

		<p>Be careful when using GWP/SWP to save and restore state. Many things can go wrong like user changed dpi, fonts, other display settings, removed a monitor, resize/moved the taskbar, etc. SWP didn&#8217;t send a WM_GETMINMAXINFO msg the last time I checked so if you&#8217;re trying to constrain it to some size(s), you&#8217;ll need to do it yourself.</p>
<p>I think you can convert between screen to workspace coords using the MONITORINFO struct in GetMonitorInfo. But it doesn&#8217;t work in Windows 95.</p>

		<p>What is the difference between minimizing an application by clicking the minimize button and by clicking its button on the taskbar?<br />
<br />I noticed that when I click on the taskbar the app gets WM_ACTIVATEAPP FALSE, followed immediately by WM_ACTIVATEAPP TRUE. So I end up using another application, while the first thinks that it is still active. Why is that happening? I&#8217;ve seen this on both Win 2000 and XP.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the tips Mike and asdf!  I just tried the GetMonitorInfo method and it works great.</p>
<p>Having an interest in .net, I checked and found the WorkingArea property of Sys.Win.Frm.Screen is the same as GetMonitorInfo.</p>
<p>But beware, the info in the screen object seems to get cached.  Ask for WorkingArea, move the taskbar, then ask for it again.  The 2nd call returns the old information.  :-0</p>

		<p>One thing I never got: why didn&#8217;t the gui return the usable workspace as the root window (excluding the taskbar)? Would this have just made things even more complicated?</p>

		<p>Max,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just guessing here, because I wasn&#8217;t doing Windows programming during the pre-95 days, but here&#8217;s what I think is going on&#8230;</p>
<p>In those days, when an app was minimised it would simply appear as an icon on the desktop. That icon was still the window, and the application simply noticed that it was in the minimised state and adjusted its WM_NCPAINT handler to render the 32&#215;32 icon and caption instead. The window manager just had to set the minimised style and move and size the window to the size of an icon.</p>
<p>Since Win95, apps don&#8217;t minimise to icons anymore. You can see what they do if you kill off Explorer and minimise a window, or more easily load a standard MDI application and minimise one of the child windows. Instead, the window manager makes the window the minimum height possible and the NCPAINT message just paints a different caption on the &quot;Minimise&quot; button. All this NCPAINT stuff is handled by the built-in DefWindowProc by default, so all sane apps adopt the new behavior magically. (Some insane apps probably overrode things and needed some compatibility shims, but I&#8217;ve never seen one.)</p>
<p>Now this is where I really start guessing, although I suspect I&#8217;m close. While Explorer is loaded, it has to look like the application is &quot;minimised&quot; into the taskbar, and drawing the minimised version of the window would spoil the effect.</p>
<p>What Explorer does, then, is to notice that a window has been maximised and adjust the pretty whooshy animation to go to the taskbar button instead. The window still needs to go somewhere, though, so it gets shifted way offscreen where it won&#8217;t bother anyone while it&#8217;s in its minimised state.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;ve got this all drastically wrong, hopefully Raymond will correct me! :)</p>

		<p>Joe,</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your answer! </p>
<p>Indeed, it would be nice if Raymond could write some additional lines for clarification.</p>
<p>btw are there any rumors that Raymond writes a book about all that incredible usefull/interesting stuff?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
