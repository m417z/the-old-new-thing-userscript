		<p>Wow I can&#39;t figure out wtf is going on. &nbsp;OK:</p>
<p>1) This guy is afraid something that happened on a FRIDAY is going to happen to him next, and he assumes everyone at Microsoft knows about it like it was on the level of the BP oil spill or something.</p>
<p>2) He&#39;s afraid of some hacker guy but thinks giving out all his contact info over unsecure communications is a good idea.</p>
<p>3) He thinks Microsoft powers his GPS and this hacker broke into Microsoft and stopped it (?) and then destroyed his computers.</p>
<p>4) He&#39;s probably on drugs.</p>

		<p>I worked in phone support for many years, and came across the odd case like this too. I&#39;m not a psychiatrist, but you get a very real sense of their fear when someone starts whispering and crying to you over the phone, because a) they&#39;re scared, and b) someone&#39;s listening.</p>
<p>So while it&#39;s fun for us <em>norms</em> to laugh at the patent ridiculousness of the interpretable claims, it&#39;s absolutely as real as the keyboard I&#39;m typing this on to them. Perception is reality.</p>

		<p>A few things to note here:</p>
<p>1) I&#39;m really jealous of someone who can have bluetooth that&#39;s capable of transmitting over 1000 yards, or should I?</p>
<p>2) Some hacker&#39;s c trashed 4 of his PC remotely, meaning he origionally has more than 4 PC.</p>
<p>3) If someone nearing him has bluetooth device of such power, been used some way to cut off GPS searching, plus has destroyed 4 of his PC&#8230; well, he probably should be scared because I&#39;m not surprised if he get cancer anytime, or be toasted, or both&#8230; :O</p>

		<p>Dear User,</p>
<p>Don&#39;t take the drugs. The blue pill is a tracking program that will help *them* find you. If you take it, hackers will pwn your GPS and cut you off from the matrix. He will then intrude at will on your GMAIL,HOTMAIL,LIVE,AOL.YAHOO.</p>
<p>BTW, What&#39;s with that blue tooth? Of course the neighbors are looking at you weird. You should really get that looked at.</p>

		<p>One thing I hate about paranoiacs is that their existence makes it incredibly hard to bring up certain problems. Especially when dealing with IT security, people will go âyou&#39;re paranoidâ and stop listening. And then the DBMS gets hacked, but that does not mean that people start listening then. If paranoia didn&#39;t exist we wouldn&#39;t have this problem.</p>

		<p>Until last year when I cleaned up, I used to be on methamphetamine for 5 years. I knew long before his giveaway line:</p>
<p>im NOT ON DRUGS&#8230;</p>
<p>Why would anybody say that, unless they were paranoid that people could somehow &quot;see&quot; that they are on drugs? Paranoia and weird delusions are all part of amphetamine psychosis. It&#39;s surprising that he even bothered to send the e-mail. Everybody knows Microsoft can see and hear everything you&#39;re doing&#8230; :)</p>

		<p>People here laugh, but I&#39;ve observed how much people&#39;s imaginations run wild when they get the idea that &quot;hackers&quot; are after them. &nbsp;They&#39;ll suspend disbelief for anything that suggests said hackers might be mere mortals, rather than ethereal beings capable of pretty much everything. &nbsp;Probably they watch too many movies, or heard too many stories in the press about their &quot;leetness&quot;, and fear kicks in.</p>

		<p>@Drak: Yes, Raymond used the normal humrous version, but ponder what Nobody&#39;s twist on it means.</p>

		<p>Crackpots always bother me, how do these people function in regular society? Do they not have anybody that cares about them enough to get them some help.</p>
<p>Anyhow a recent post on an Australian forum for an ISP is case in point <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=1473647&amp;ux=149915" rel="nofollow">forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm</a></p>
<p>I figured it might be interesting for all the members of the &quot;ITCartel&quot;, now that they know they&#39;ve been exposed.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
