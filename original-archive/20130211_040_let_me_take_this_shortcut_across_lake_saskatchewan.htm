<p>I dreamed that I had to drive from Los Angeles to Berkeley to catch my flight home. To do this, I used a product from a local startup company: A computerized map of the Bay Area.</p>
<p> There were two routes across Lake Saskatchewan. The southern route is highway I-70, and the northern route is an elevated highway that goes right past the head of the Canadian Statue of Freedom, a 300-foot-tall statue carved from a single rock. This shows that computer nerds are horrible cartographers:  Berkeley has an airport, Los Angeles is on the peninsula just south of San Francisco, and the Bay Area is in Canada. </p>
<p> Sure, this is an absurd dream, but you gotta admit, that shortcut across Lake Saskatchewan would be pretty awesome. </p>

		<p>It&#39;s funny how the distance between places shrinks in your mind when you don&#39;t pay attention to what&#39;s between them. &nbsp;I think your dream geography is the same phenomenon as Americans thinking all the major cities in Europe are right next to each other, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Is Lake Saskatchewan like the Polish Sea?</p>

		<p>The difference between Americans and Europeans:</p>
<p>Americans think 100 years is a long time, while Europeans think a 100 miles ( er.. um 166 km) is a long distance.</p>

		<p>Texas is a pretty small state, I&#39;ve always thought.</p>
<p>A comparison, just for fun:</p>
<p>Miami to San Antonio: 2,200 km</p>
<p>States Travelled: Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas</p>
<p>Major cities passed: Orlando, New Orleans, Houston</p>
<p>Broome to Perth: 2,200 km</p>

<p>Major cities passed: &#8230;</p>

		<p>Ben: You got in ahead of me! We&#39;re actually looking at doing the Perth-&gt;Broome (well, Perth-&gt;Derby) trip mid-year to visit my brother-in-law and his family, who moved there last year. Probably come back down around the coast, which&#39;ll be even longer and still not pass through any major cities :)</p>

		<p>&quot;Europeans think a 100 miles ( er.. um 166 km) is a long distance.&quot;</p>
<p>I remember a few years ago seeing a UK headline &quot;Man chases lorry across three counties after it clips his home&quot;. At the time I lived in San Bernardino County, which is maybe 150 miles (230 km) wide, and I worked in Clark County, which is maybe 120 miles (200 km) across (from Primm to Mesquite). I pictured a 300-mile chase, but it was actually only 20 miles.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
