<p>Alas, budget cuts over at <a href="http://www.sr.se/">Sveriges Radio</a> have reduced the staff of <a href="http://www.sr.se/p4/klartext/">Klartext</a>, the Swedish news program presented in easy Swedish, from three to two, so they won't be able to provide text summaries of the radio show. I had been using the summaries to help me fill in the gaps I had missed, but now I guess I'll just have to listen even more closely.</p>
<p> I can make out perhaps a fifth of what's going on.  If I really concentrate (and they speak slowly enough), it might reach half. But after the first two stories or so, my brain explodes and I have to take a rest. </p>
<p> Embarrasingly, it took me weeks to figure out what they were saying to introduce each show!  "Programmet som f&ouml;rklarar nyheterna p&aring; ett enklare s&auml;tt."  I got stuck on the first word; even today it sounds like the guy is saying what seems to be the nonsense word "p&ouml;rjammet". </p>
<p> The two types of stories I like most on Swedish radio are (1)&nbsp;where they talk about the United States, since it's enlightening to learn how others see us, and (2)&nbsp;when they talk about slimy politicians. </p>
<p> The Swedes seem all upset that their politicians are selfish money-grubbing sleazeballs.  Hey, you idealistic Swedes, they're <b>politicians</b>. Being selfish money-grubbing sleazeballs is their job! </p>
<p> Exhibit A: Politicians paid for sitting on committees, but don't actually show up for committee meetings. When confronted, one politician explained, "I didn't realize I was being paid."  (Translation: "I don't do things unless I get paid to do them.")  Another used the excuse, "I didn't know I was supposed to attend the meetings." (Translation: "Sure, go ahead, pay me extra money, I'll gladly take it, but if you expect me to do work, you have to tell me!") </p>
<p> Exhibit B: Members of the Riksdag are permitted a free rail pass to travel between their constituency and Stockholm. Half of the MPs which avail themselves of this perk choose the most expensive railway ticket, the so-called "<a href="http://www.sj.se/node/0,4452,2596_1,FF.html">&Aring;rskort Guld</a>" (Annual Gold Card), which gets you a complimentary three-course meal among other top-class amenities. All these Gold Cards cost the Swedish taxpayer over a million Kronor per year, compared to the cost of buying them all coach tickets. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, here in the United States, we don't even bat an eye when <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/12/20/MNGBL3RJP01.DTL"> one representative sneaks a US$225,000 renovation of his home town's swimming pool into the federal budget, and another secures a US$50 million grant to build an indoor rain forest in Iowa</a>. </p>
<p> That buys a lot of train tickets. </p>

		<p>Why don&#8217;t you record the programmes? Then you can listen to them as often as you want to get the meaning, rewinding over bits you don&#8217;t understand.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s what I do, but repeated listening goes only so far. I must have rewound over &quot;programmet som f&#246;rklarar&quot; two dozen times without ever getting it.</p>
<p>I have a German CD that I listen to in the car and there are still some words I can&#8217;t figure out no matter how many times I listen to it.</p>

		<p>Sorry that you missed the funniest politician/money scandal to date: The (female) leader of the the leftwing party &quot;V&#228;nsterpartiet&quot;, which ofcourse is VERY pro taxes, have been cheating with her taxes for the last 5 years (they are not allowed to check anything older).</p>
<p>Double standards anyone? *smirk*</p>
<p>PS. Lycka till med svenskstudierna, Raymond. DS.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
