A customer had a program that decided at runtime
what language to use for its user interface.
The customer was having trouble getting the program's
dialog boxes to show up with right-to-left layout
when necessary.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
We are setting the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>LAYOUT&shy;RTL</code>
extended style in the dialog box's
<code>WM_</code><code>INIT&shy;DIALOG</code> message handler,
but
what we're seeing is
that although the style applies successfully,
and the dialog itself renders RTL,
its child elements don't.
</p>
<div STYLE="display: inline-block; border: solid 1px #5284bc">
<table BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0
       STYLE="color: black; background-color: white;
              hyphens: manual; font-size: 10pt; width: 30em;

<p>
The actual screen shot provided by the customer
involved Arabic text, but I used English text so you
can see which parts are running left-to-right and
which parts are right-to-left.
Also, because I don't know Arabic.
</p>
<p>
The title bar is running right-to-left, as desired,
but the contents of the dialog are still left-to-right.
What's going on?
</p>
<p>
As I've noted before,
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100611-00/?p=13743">
the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>LAYOUT&shy;RTL</code>
extended style
is inherited by child windows</a>
(unless blocked by the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>NO&shy;INHERIT&shy;LAYOUT</code>
extended style).
What I didn't call out is that this inheritance occurs at the
point the child window is created.
The child window takes a snapshot of its parent window's
layout;
future changes to the parent window's layout have no effect.
</p>
<p>
The next piece of the puzzle is realizing that the
<code>WM_</code><code>INIT&shy;DIALOG</code> message
is sent after the child windows have been created.
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050331-00/?p=36003">
I called this out explicitly in an earlier discussion of dialog boxes</a>,
but you already know this,
because your
<code>WM_</code><code>INIT&shy;DIALOG</code> message handler
calls
<code>Get&shy;Dlg&shy;Item</code> to obtain handles to dialog
child windows in order to initialize and configure them.
</p>
<p>
So you need to get the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>LAYOUT&shy;RTL</code>
onto the window before child windows are created.
One way of doing this is to edit the dialog template
and add (or remove) the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>LAYOUT&shy;RTL</code>
extended style
from the
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040623-00/?p=38753">
<code>dwExStyle</code> member of the 32-bit extended header</a>
before you call
<code>Create&shy;Dialog&shy;Indirect</code> or one of its relatives.</p>

		<p>And the other way is to use something like EnumChildWindows() to set attribute to every child window in WM_INITDIALOG?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
