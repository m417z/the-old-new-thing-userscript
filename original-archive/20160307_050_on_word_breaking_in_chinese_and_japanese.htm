In Western languages, you can generally break a line at whitespace.
(You can also break a line within a word, subject to language-specific
hyphenation rules, but let's not get into that.)
People unfamiliar with other language families sometimes wonder what's
up with line breaking in other languages.
In particular,
line breaking in Chinese and Japanese tend to elicit
confused responses.

When I put text in a static control and it does not fit,
the behavior is different depending on whether I'm using
Chinese characters or Latin characters.
Why does the Chinese string wrap to the second line,
but the Latin string does not?

In Chinese and Japanese, there are no spaces between words,
so if you're going to wait for a space before inserting a line break,
you're going to be waiting a long time.
Instead, to a first approximation,
line breaks are permitted after almost any character.
(You can learn
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_breaking_rules_in_East_Asian_languages">
the finer points of line breaking</a>
from Wikipedia.)
</p>
<p>
The static control uses
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd374091.aspx">
Uniscribe</a> to decide where to insert line breaks,
and Uniscribe understands that in Chinese and Japanese text,
you can break after almost any character.
That's why you're seeing a line break in the static control with
Chinese text.
On the other hand, the static control cannot find a valid word break
in the Latin string, so it all gets jammed onto one line (and the
excess gets clipped).
</p>
<p>
The <code>Draw&shy;Text</code> function also has rudimentary
understanding of line breaks in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text.
You can override the default line breaking rule of
"line breaks allowed after any full-width character"
by passing the <code>DT_<wbr>NO&shy;FULL&shy;WIDTH&shy;CHAR&shy;BREAK</code>
flag,
which forces the <code>Draw&shy;Text</code> function to break
only at whitespace.
(Basically, have it treat CJK characters as if they were Latin.)
</p>
<p>
The documentation for
<code>DT_<wbr>NO&shy;FULL&shy;WIDTH&shy;CHAR&shy;BREAK</code>
notes that it may be useful to pass this flag if you know that the
text is Korean,
because Korean does put spaces between words,
and preferring to break Korean text at whitespace can result
in more attractive results.
(The <code>Draw&shy;Text</code> function is not very clever
and does not try to autodetect
whether the string is Korean.
It is legal to
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_mixed_script">
mix Chinese characters into Korean text</a>,
and trying to figure out whether the string is "Mostly Korean
with Chinese characters mixed in" or
"Mostly Chinese with Korean mixed in" would require too much fuzzy
logic for the simple
<code>Draw&shy;Text</code> function.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
You thought Chinese, Japanese, and Korean line breaking is hard.
Thai is even harder.
In Thai, words are run together with no spaces,
but
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688158.aspx">
line breaks are permitted only between words</a>.
This means that in order to break lines properly,
you need a Thai dictionary.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus bonus chatter</b>:
On that last page I linked to,
there is a reference to the Windows Intelligent Font Emulator,
which went by the acronym WIFE.
Somebody probably worked really hard to retrofit that acronym.</p>

		<p>I was once working on a cross-platform game which we were localizing into Japanese.  The engine we were using did not support Japanese word breaking, so the bulk of the engineering work for that localization project was implementing the Japanese word breaking rules (the game was pretty much done otherwise and had previously been localized into EFIGS).  It was not at all trivial.</p>

		<p>My wife tried to explain how to break Thai writing to me a couple times. I still don&#8217;t understand :-/ I suspect that it&#8217;s very hard to get used to reading/writing text without spaces between words when you&#8217;re older, and are conditioned to using spaces to show where the words are.</p>

		<p>If Chinese and Japanese have no spaces, how do they deal with possible ambiguous combinations?</p>
<p>For example: WEFOUNDSOMEBODY</p>
<p>Did we find somebody (a person) or some body (a corpse)?</p>

		<p>In general you can figure it out either by context or using a word that removes the ambiguity, like &#8220;WEFOUNDACORPSE&#8221; or &#8220;WEFOUNDAPERSON&#8221; instead.</p>

		<p>Obviously I wasn&#8217;t referring to those same literal words in another language, but rather to scenarios analogous to this one in English, because surely they exist.  You&#8217;ll have issues like that in any sufficiently complex natural language.</p>

		<p>Try to think &#8220;strokes&#8221; in Chinese characters as alphabets and the &#8220;Chinese characters&#8221; as &#8220;words&#8221; in English and you&#8217;ll find more sense. (in &#8220;辭海&#8221; you&#8217;ll see there are almost 20,000 Simplified Chinese characters, although for commonly used ones it&#8217;s reduced to around 3,500. If in Traditional Chinese, the numbers would be around 48,000 and 5,000 respectively)</p>
<p>Chinese words can be made with one or more Chinese characters like in English (e.g.: fire engine), just that in Chinese, words made with 2 or more characters are more common.</p>

		<p>&gt; For example: WEFOUNDSOMEBODY</p>
<p>The Japanese language has some classes of characters. So at a glance it looks more like WeFoundSomeBody or WeFoundSomebody rather than WEFOUNDSOMEBODY.</p>

		<p>For line breaking Thai *properly*, a dictionary isn&#8217;t necessarily going to be good enough.  You are going to need a natural language parser to understand that (something equivalent to) WEFOUNDSOMEBODY sounds unnatural as &#8220;we found some body&#8221;, so it much be &#8220;we found somebody&#8221;, so the break must go before the &#8220;some&#8221; and not the &#8220;body&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Or you can cheat and insist that the words are delimited with  U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE.  That is probably the right answer for something like a UI where there usually isn&#8217;t *that* much text, and it is being prepared by experts who understand the strange requirements of L10N.</p>

		<p>Japanese is slightly more subtle. When writing horizontally it is good style to line-break at the end of hiragana word endings, which in most cases can be spotted programatically as a change from hiragana character to a kanji character, viz  白い川 you would break 白い/川.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
