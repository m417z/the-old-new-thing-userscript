In Windows 95, it became tradition that if you
modified the code that displays the font preview
in the Windows 95 command prompt font chooser
property sheet page,
you also got to tweak the sample date and file sizes
to be a value personally significant to you.
</p>
<p>
<img SRC="http://web.archive.org/web/20180825201855if_/http://omolini.steptail.com/mirror/www.uwe-sieber.de/gif/dosbox_fonts_9x_e.gif" TITLE="Windows 95 MS-DOS Prompt Properties, font selection page, with sample directory listing">
</p>
<p>
By the time Windows 95 shipped, the values in the font
preview were as follows:
</p>
<pre>
C:\WINDOWS&gt; dir
Directory of C:\WINDOWS
SYSTEM       &lt;DIR&gt;     03-01-95
WIN      COM    22,867 03-01-95
WIN      INI    11,728 03-01-95
WELCOME  EXE    19,539 03-01-95
</pre>
<p>
I don't see the significance to these values,
but maybe you can try to find something.
Unfortunately, I don't know who the last person was
to modify the dialog template, so I can't ask them.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
When I told this story to one of my colleagues,
I received a story in exchange:
When this dialog was ported to Windows NT,
the developer who did this slipped his name
as the last "file" of the the directory listing,
which was visible only when you picked the smallest
font size.
It was discovered and removed as part of the
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/larryosterman/2005/10/21/why-no-easter-eggs/">
Easter egg purge</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Riffing on Larry, 13 years later</b>:
A note on that rogue Exchange 5.0 Easter egg that
my program kept triggering by mistake:
Triggering the Easter egg by mistake is bad enough,
but what made it even worse was that once you triggered it,
the session was poisoned:
Commands would behave erratically from that point onward.
You had to disconnect from the server and reconnect
in order to fix the problem.
So yeah, bad Easter egg.</p>

<p>The &#8220;easter egg purge&#8221; is so interesting. I always kind of wondered why there were less and less easter eggs in Microsoft products. Now I know.</p>

		<p>While I generally disapprove of the Easter egg purge, I have to admit that exchange Easter egg was horrifying.</p>
<p>The most recent Easter egg I placed was an extra MVC mapping so that if somebody requested the &#8220;directory&#8221; containing all the API POST methods, they got a line of static text.</p>

		<p>I hope you do have a spec for your Easter eggs and inform your testers about it.</p>
<p>The alternative would be to ship untested and unreviewed code in a product that apparently hosts a web server. Something that doesn&#8217;t inspire confidence, so I hope it&#8217;s the former.</p>

		<p>Easter egg code gets reviewed, tested by engineering. It doesn&#8217;t appear in the API specs only because it isn&#8217;t contractual.</p>
<p>This particular egg has a purpose. It permits bisection testing of the results streamer w/o running the the the result stream generator. If a .NET update breaks the way we stream results we can tell.</p>

		<p>I on the other hand do approve of the principle behind the Easter Egg Purge, but my solution would be that any easter eggs have to be part of the design spec, instead of excising them out completely.</p>

		<p>Then they wouldn&#8217;t be Easter eggs. By definition, an Easter egg is some piece of hidden functionality. And if you document it, it isn&#8217;t hidden anymore.</p>

		<p>Document for testers at least&#8230;  Leave it out of end-user docs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like the parents hiding the eggs for the kids &#8211; the adults are all in cahoots but the kids still get the fun</p>

		<p>Had to check the NT directory listing in my NT 3.51 VM, and there it is. Interestingly I can&#8217;t find any mention of this on any of the easter egg database sites, so it may have been previously unknown.</p>

		<p>From the link of the purge:<br />
&#8220;When I was discussing this topic with Raymond Chen, he pointed out that his real-world IMAP client hit this bug &#8211; and he was more than slightly upset at us for it.&#8221;<br />
So this was Ray using his legendary thermonuclear skills on Larry, huh? That would&#8217;ve been a sight to behold :P</p>

		<p>Interesting, I wonder if it&#8217;s still being maintained. My version of Windows 8 has all the files updated 10-01-99. Does that mean it hasn&#8217;t changed since Windows 2000? Also, the actual output of dir, at least for me, shows results in the format &#8220;date time size name&#8221;, but the example is still in the order shown above (though with different files and directories)</p>

		<p>For future reference, the full text in Windows 7 is:<br />
C:\Windows&gt; dir<br />
SYSTEM       &lt;DIR&gt;     10-01-99   5:00a<br />
SYSTEM32     &lt;DIR&gt;     10-01-99   5:00a<br />
README   TXT     26926 10-01-99   5:00a<br />
WINDOWS  BMP     46080 10-01-99   5:00a<br />
NOTEPAD  EXE    337232 10-01-99   5:00a<br />
CLOCK    AVI     39594 10-01-99   5:00p<br />
WIN      INI      7005 10-01-99   5:00a</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that:<br />
&#8211; The text below README and everything to the right of DIR is not visible in the actual property page, therefore the am/pm change for CLOCK.AVI and the file sizes are not displayed.<br />
&#8211; The text does not seem to be localized (the above text was captured on a system localized to de-de).<br />
&#8211; The files README.TXT, WINDOWS.BMP, CLOCK.AVI did not exist on the test system; the files NOTEPAD.EXE (notepad.exe) and WIN.INI (win.ini) use different casing, which is reflected when actually executing dir.<br />
&#8211; The files in the sample output are not sorted alphabetically by name, like the actual dir does by default in the tested OS.</p>

		<p>That was my first instinct, but DD/M/YY is wrong for US, and someone else pointed out 11728*2==23456 which seems much too exact to be coincidence, so I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re dates.</p>

		<p>@viila: DD/M/YY is not in common use in the US, but I wouldn&#8217;t call it &#8220;wrong&#8221;.  It&#8217;s a date format like any other.  Using a date format which is not common in the US, and then formatting it as a number, would be right in line with a hidden message.</p>

		<p>Provides a good range of characters: narrow, wide and even a lower case &#8220;y&#8221; for the descender. The strange element is the number &#8220;4&#8221; is omitted from the sample though showing the differences between the &#8220;1&#8221; versus &#8220;I&#8221; and the &#8220;O&#8221; versus &#8220;0&#8221; are more relevant.</p>

		<p>The files sizes could be translated to dates, in UK format (DD-M-YY). Perhaps the first is the developer birth date (22-Aug-67) born to parents with birth dates of 11-Jul-28 and 19-May-39. More likely this is just the human ability to pick out a pattern where none exists &#8211; at least for this suggestion.</p>

		<p>22867 = hex 5953, in ASCII &#8220;YS&#8221;<br />
11728 = hex 2DD0 -&gt;&#8221;-√ê&#8221; (whatever that means, some kind of smiley perhaps?)<br />
19539 = hex 4C53 -&gt; &#8220;LS&#8221;</p>
<p>At least the first and last number appear to be encoded initials.</p>

		<p>0xD0 in CP850 is a lowercase eth (√∞), not that that helps.</p>

		<p>I recall placing an &#8216;easter egg&#8217; (more of a reference to a certain adult oriented adventure game) in a bit of code when we first used SOAP. I put a comment in just before the call to a SOAP service saying <!-- soap-on-a-rope -->.</p>
<p>A client discovered this and called our help desk to inquire as to what it meant.</p>

		<p>Die Windows 95-Befehlszeilenkonsolenschriftartenauswahldialogeigenschaftsseite.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t manage to count the characters, is it really longer than in English?</p>
<p>Also: putting hyphens between the nouns in different ways could change the meaning in subtle ways.</p>
<p>For everyday use, you would probably put it like this:</p>
<p>Die Eigenschaftsseite des Dialogs zum Ausw√§hlen der Schriftart f√ºr die Befehlszeilenkonsole.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s definitely longer than in English.</p>

		<p>@florian: &#8220;Also: putting hyphens between the nouns in different ways could change the meaning in subtle ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the vinyl record days, with pick ups where either the coils or the magnet were moving, I read one article about some &#8220;moving<br />
coil-pick ups&#8221;</p>
<p>I had never before seen a coil-pick, and certainly not a moving one (or maybe it would be a few ups that were both coil-pick, whatever that is, and moving at the same time), so it took me a couple of seconds to grasp it. The line break before &#8220;coil-pick&#8221; (which was there) didn&#8217;t improve readability.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
