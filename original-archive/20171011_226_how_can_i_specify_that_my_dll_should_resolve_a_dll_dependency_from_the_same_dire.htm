<p>
A customer had a program that loaded two DLLs,
let's call them <code>A.DLL</code> and <code>B.DLL</code>.
Both of those DLLs use a common helper DLL called <code>C.DLL</code>.
The catch is that the two DLLs want to use
<i>different incompatible versions</i> of
<code>C.DLL</code>.
The two DLLs <code>A.DLL</code> and <code>B.DLL</code> reside in
separate folders, and each folder has a corresponding copy of
<code>C.DLL</code>.
</p>
<p>
An additional complicating factor is that
<code>A.DLL</code> was written by a third party and cannot be modified.
</p>
<p>
The customer was hoping there would be some way to get the two DLLs
<code>A.DLL</code> and <code>B.DLL</code> to use their respective
versions of <code>C.DLL</code>.
They suspect that some magic with activation contexts and manifests
might do the trick, but they didn't have the expertise to figure out
exactly what.
(And remember that <code>A.DLL</code> came from a third party and
cannot be modified.)
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/talagrand/">
Eugene Talagrand</a>
explained that
you can solve the problem with manifests.
Embed a manifest into <code>B.DLL</code> with resource ID 2
that looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?&gt;
&lt;assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;file name="C.dll" /&gt;
&lt;/assembly&gt;
</pre>
<p>
You don't have to make any changes to the code
that loads <code>B.DLL</code>.
When you try to load <code>B.DLL</code>,
the system will recognize the manifest,
and that manifest tells the system to ignore any rogue copies of
<code>C.DLL</code> and link <code>B.DLL</code> to the copy of
<code>C.DLL</code> in the same directory.
Furthermore, this special "<code>B.DLL</code>-specific"
version of <code>C.DLL</code> is not made visible to other DLLs
(unless they specifically ask for it with their own manifest),
so when the program loads
<code>A.DLL</code>,
it will ignore the
"<code>B.DLL</code>-specific"
copy and look for <code>C.DLL</code> using
the traditional search path.
</p>
<p>
The customer confirmed that
adding the manifest to <code>B.DLL</code> worked!
</p>
<p>
Note that the manifest declaration applies to DLL dependencies
resolved when <code>B.DLL</code> is loaded.
If <code>B.DLL</code> performs a <code>LoadLibrary("C.DLL")</code>
at run time,
then it will need to make its activation context active when it loads
the DLL so that the system knows to follow the instructions in the manifest.

		<p>Does this work if B.dll is loaded via LoadLibrary(&#8216;\\directory\\that\\is\\not\\on\\the\\PATH\\B.dll&#8221;)?  When I was trying to solve the problem in the title, I marked C.DLL as &#8220;DelayLoad&#8221;, and B.dll had a delay load handler which searched the directory containing B.dll for a copy of C.dll and loaded it if present.</p>

		<p>I always wondered why DLL redirection was disabled when an application had a manifest. This is definitely much better.<br />
It is always a shame that SxS stuff didn&#8217;t have great documentation and the only real exposure to them most people had were the CRT for VS2005 and VS2008. There is a lot of good here that people just don&#8217;t bother with.</p>

		<p>Yeah, especially because something was *messed up* with VS2005&#8217;s c library where another application could hose your copy of it even if you put your copy in the application directory. Somehow it resolved no copies.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
