		<p>Since we are on the subject of the Recycle Bin, I had a strange issue where SHFileOperation aborted because of an error it encountered traversing the Recycle Bin on a removable drive (a USB flash memory drive). &nbsp;I know IFileOperation superseded SHFileOperation, but I need to support XP, and mostly asking because I&#39;m intellectually curious why SHFileOperation would have an issue with the Recycle Bin, since they are both owned by the Shell.</p>

		<p>Since Folder Redirection is frequently coupled with Offline Files (it may be required, though I&#39;m not sure), the local copy would already exist as part of the offline file synchronization. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>@Maurits: it&#39;s on the network. &nbsp;Has to be, really, or the content of the Recycle Bin for your Documents folder would change depending on which computer you were using; it would also empty itself unexpectedly if the machine is configured to not keep local profiles, and so on. &nbsp;I don&#39;t see that the security issue is significantly different than the case of &quot;deleting&quot; a local file.</p>
<p>@Derlin: you can do folder redirection even if offline files are disabled. &nbsp;However, the offline files functionality does behave differently for redirected folders, which may result in it turning itself on unexpectedly. &nbsp;(I forget the exact details; I think it ignores the setting on the share, so to turn it off you have to disable it in group policy.)</p>

		<p>@Maurits It has to be on the network. &nbsp;When files are moved to the Recycle Bin they do not cross volume boundaries (so the operation is as fast as a delete). &nbsp;Every drive on your system has an invisible folder used to store recycled files from that drive.</p>

		<p>&gt; a network Recycle Bin location is created to hold the files deleted from My Documents</p>
<p>Is this location on the network, or is it local?</p>
<p>If it&#39;s on the network, that means when you delete a file from the network, it&#39;s not *really* deleted, which could be a security issue if the user expected it to be deleted.</p>
<p>If it&#39;s local, then deleting a file from the network involves copying it locally, which creates interesting performance conundra.</p>

		<p>Vista beta 2 had a network Recycle Bin feature without using folder redirection but it was removed in RC1: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/investigating-windows-vistas-recycle-bin-properties/">http://www.techrepublic.com/&#8230;/investigating-windows-vistas-recycle-bin-properties</a></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
