<p>
Today's Little Program simulates pressing the Play/Pause
button on your fancy keyboard.
This might be useful if you want to write a program that converts
some other input (say, gesture detection) into media controller events.
</p>
<p>
One way of doing this is to take advantage of the
<code>Def&shy;Window&shy;Proc</code> function,
since the default behavior for the
<code>WM_<wbr>APP&shy;COMMAND</code> message is to pass
the message up the parent chain,
and if it still can't find a handler,
it hands the message to the shell for global processing.
</p>
<p>
Remember, don't
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/13/629451.aspx">
fumble around</a>.
If you want to send a message to a window,
then send a message to a window.
Don't broadcast a message to every window in the system
(resulting in mass chaos).
</p>
<p>
Take the scratch program and make this simple addition:
</p>
<pre>
void OnChar(HWND hwnd, TCHAR ch, int cRepeat)
{
 if (ch == ' ') {
  SendMessage(hwnd, WM_APPCOMMAND, (WPARAM)hwnd,
      MAKELONG(0, FAPPCOMMAND_KEY | APPCOMMAND_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE));
 }
}

 HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_CHAR, OnChar);
</pre>
<p>
When you press the space bar in the scratch application,
it pretends that you instead pressed the <i>Play/Pause</i>
button on your fancy keyboard with no shift modifiers.
</p>
<p>
The scratch program doesn't do anything with the key,
so it ends up falling through to
<code>Def&shy;Window&shy;Proc</code>,
which eventually hands the key to the shell and any other
registered shell hooks.
If you have a program like Windows Media Player
which registers for shell events,
it will see the notification and pause/resume playback.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this assumes that the program you want to talk to
listens globally for the keypress.
If you want to make the current foreground program respond
as if you had pressed the <i>Play/Pause</i>,
you can just inject the keypress.
</p>
<pre>
int __cdecl main(int, char**)
{
 INPUT inputs[2] = {};
 inputs[0].type = INPUT_KEYBOARD;
 inputs[0].ki.wVk = VK_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE;
 inputs[0].ki.wScan = <a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463446#END">0x22</a>;
 inputs[0].ki.dwFlags = KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY;
 inputs[1].type = INPUT_KEYBOARD;
 inputs[1].ki.wVk = VK_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE;
 inputs[1].ki.wScan = 0x22;
 inputs[0].ki.dwFlags = KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY | KEYEVENTF_KEYUP;
 SendInput(2, inputs, sizeof(INPUT));
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
Note, however, that since we didn't do anything about the
state of modifier keys,
if the user happens to have the shift key down at the time
you injected the message,
the application is going to be told,
"Hey, do your play/pause thing, and if you change behavior
when the shift key is down, here's your chance."
</p>
<p>
But what did you expect from a Little Program?</p>

		<p>Well that seems a bit more palatable than registering for WH_SHELLHOOK which I would assume that in addition to a 32 bit DLL to inject you would also need a stub 64-bit DLL to receive WM_APPCOMMANDS that went to 64 bit processes.</p>

		<p>From the linked article: &nbsp;[With the source code, people would be more likely to break the rules, because they can see which rules they can get away with breaking.] -Raymond Chen</p>
<p>This one cuts both ways. Because the source to Windows Forms is available, I was able to quickly locate a bug within an hour of encountering it and actually produce a fix. Unfortunately the only viable fix is poking directly into the variables of the WinForms code. Previous attempts at filing bugs, results in *none* of them ever getting fixed, and merely closed out 3 years later. (Yes I can watch this on MS Connect.) Seriously, what do you expect people to do?</p>
<p>As for don&#39;t use WinForms, you&#39;re talking 3 man years to move away now.</p>
<p>For reference, here is the entirety of my fix (SetPrivateField is a helper function for the reflection API):</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#39;System.Windows.Forms BUG: Check Box size is not set correctly for high DPI.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SetPrivateField(Me, &quot;idealCheckSize&quot;, SystemInformation.MenuCheckSize.Height)</p>
<p>I guess I&#39;m willing to take the bet that if bugs aren&#39;t getting fixed that MS just isn&#39;t maintaining WinForms anymore and so the hitpoint is never gonna change.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
