		<p>@Lockwood: I guess they are not exactly the same. &nbsp;A critical section may contain a (keyed) event handle. &nbsp;The invalid handle error means that the handle is completely invalid and doesn&#39;t reference anything. &nbsp;The object type mismatch error means that the handle is a valid handle but doesn&#39;t refer to a (keyed) event.</p>
<p>But they both mean &quot;the handle is wrong&quot; and the root causes are the same.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s one last step away from getting really unlucky, where the previously released event handle has been assigned to another event, and your call &quot;succeeds&quot;.</p>

		<p>@laonianren: I don&#39;t know anything about critical sections; I live in .NET land, and enjoy Raymond&#39;s writings about the OS.</p>
<p>If these are 2 cases which lead to the same end point, &quot;the handle is wrong&quot;, and they both have the same root cause, why have 2 messages and not a slightly fluffier one to cover both? STATUS_OBJECT_TYPE_MISMATCH_OR_INVALID_HANDLE? Or similar but shorter.</p>

		<p>Because distinguishing &quot;that is not a handle&quot; and &quot;that is a handle but not the right type of handle&quot; may sometimes be useful to programmers.</p>

		<p>STATUS_OBJECT_TYPE_MISMATCH_OR_INVALID_HANDLE reminds me of the SQL error message &quot;String or binary data would be truncated&quot;. &nbsp;I hate that message.</p>
<p>The storage engine knows whether STRING data or BINARY data would be truncated, but it refuses to tell you which. &nbsp;It also doesn&#39;t tell you the other crucial piece of useful information, which is the name of the relevant column. &nbsp;Sometimes it&#39;s very tedious to figure this out.</p>

		<p>For Windows 8, we&#39;ve &quot;electrified the fences&quot; a bit in the kernel and instituted the policy to make accessing an invalid handle throw an immediate exception. The policy is always on for Metro apps. You can use the SetProcessMitigationPolicy API (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh769088(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/hh769088(v=vs.85).aspx</a>) to enable this on existing desktop apps.</p>

		<p>@David Walker, IE always annoyed me when it came up with something like &quot;Cannot connect to server or DNS error.&quot; &nbsp;So is that site down, or the whole Internet broken?</p>
<p>Older MySQLs had the unhelpful message, &quot;Duplicate entry in key 2.&quot; &nbsp;Which lets the DBA use SHOW INDEX to figure out the affected column, but by then the user is gone, and so is the value they were trying to insert.</p>

		<p>@Lockwood When you put on your kernel-colored glasses (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/12/10163578.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/10163578.aspx</a>), they are different errors noticed by different components for different reasons. This LeaveCriticalSection condition is all about &quot;exploring&quot; undefined behavior and seeing which error case you happen to hit (if you are lucky enough to hit an error case).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
