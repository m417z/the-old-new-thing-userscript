<p>Work on Windows occurs in several different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_(software)"> branches</a> of the source code, and changes in one branch propagate to other branches. The goal is to push changes toward the trunk on a regular <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/03/08/10137879.aspx"> cadence</a>. I will illustrate with an extremely simplified example because the complexities aren't really important. Consider this branch structure:</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="black" style="text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse">

<td colspan="10" bgcolor="lightblue">Trunk</td>

<tr>
<td colspan="2" style="background-color: rgb(255,128,128)">A</td>

<p> Suppose for the sake of simplicity that odd-numbered leaf branches push their changes to the first-level branches on Mondays and Wednesdays, and even-numbered leaf branches push their changes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Furthermore, once a week (A on Monday, B on Tuesday, <i>etc</i>, with Friday as a buffer day) each first-level branch pushes its changes to the trunk. It does this before accepting changes from the child branch that same day, so that every change spends at least one day <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/02/13/530960.aspx"> baking</a> in a first-level branch. </p>
<p> This means that if you work in A1 and you want a change to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/07/16/10434390.aspx"> land</a> in the trunk by next Monday, you need to commit it to A1 by Wednesday. Otherwise, you will <i>miss the train</i>. </p>
<p> The metaphor here is that code changes are cargo (known in the lingo as <i>payload</i>) which are transported by an imaginary train to the next station (branch). If you <i>miss the train</i>, then your change sits on the platform and waits for the next train. </p>
<p> The imaginary train schedule looks like this: </p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="black" cellpadding="3" style="text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse">

<p> (Note that nobody actually refers to this as the train schedule. We call it the <i><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2005/02/01/364840.aspx">RI</a> schedule</i>, where <i>RI</i> is pronounced as two letters and not like the word <i>rye</i>.) </p>
<p> Suppose that there's a problem in B1 on Monday, and the branch managers decide to delay pushing their changes to B until they understand the problem and have a fix for it. If they cannot get this done before 4pm Tuesday, then the scheduled RI from B to the trunk will take place without any <i>payload</i> from B1. B1 is said to have <i>missed the RI train</i>. Unless they take special steps, their changes won't appear in the trunk until the following Tuesday at the earliest. </p>
<p> There are few things that B1 could do when they find themselves in this situation. </p>
<p> They could ask that the RI from B to the trunk be delayed until after they figure out the problem and push the fix from B1 into B. This is like asking for a train to be held at the station so that passengers on an inbound train can make their connection. </p>
<p> Maybe there's a bad bug that's in the trunk, and B1 has a fix for it. They could push just the one bug fix from B1 into B, and let that fix get pushed to the trunk on Tuesday. I guess this is like kicking everybody off the train back onto the platform except for the one fix you want to take. </p>
<p> B1 could negotiate a deal with C. "Hi, we have a fix that needs to go the trunk, but our branch is in kind of bad shape. Could you take it to the trunk for us?" The fix is pushed from B1 to C on Tuesday, and then it catches the train from C to the trunk on Wednesday. This is sort of like going to a different station. </p>
<p> They could ask for permission to make a direct change to the trunk, bypassing all the trains that normally take changes to the trunk. I'm running out of metaphors here. Maybe this is "taking the plane"? No wait, we actually have lingo for this too. It's called <i>fast-track</i>, sometimes written as <i>fasttrack</i> without the hyphen. </p>
<p> The train terminology can get more specific, with trains named after the release they are destined for. For example, the C1 branch manager might say, "The last beta train has left C1. If you still have a beta bug and you can get your fix signed off before Wednesday, contact the C branch team; we may be able to get you onto the last beta train out of C. Otherwise, you need to work with the beta release team. See the XYZ Web site for further information." </p>
<p> Here's some sample text from the trunk management team which incorporates a lot of the lingo. Practice it and you too can sound like a hip insider. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Today, we took the scheduled RI from A and two fast-track fixes, one from the B team (for bug 3141) and one from the C team (for bug 2718) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>FWIW, the train analogy is quite common. In several places I&#39;ve worked, it&#39;s the &quot;release train&quot; &#8212; version N is shipping on a particular date, whether your contribution is on board or not.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
