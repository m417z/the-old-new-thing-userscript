<p>         Now that Longhorn Rumor Season seems to have kicked up, I'm reminded of Windows 95         Rumor Season. The great thing about writing a rumors column is that you don't have         to be right! Even if you're wrong, you can just say, "Well, Microsoft changed it before         they shipped," and nobody can say you were wrong. It's a victimless crime! The only         victim is Microsoft!      </p>
<p>         Here's a classic example from early 1995:      </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p><b>Notes from the Field</b>      <br>     Microsoft's latest security scheme could leave users of Windows 95 dongling      </p>
<p>         BY ROBERT X. CRINGELY      </p>
<p>         One thing that will be pretty darned hard to steal, come Aug. 24, is a renegade copy         of Windows 95. Just before heading to the DMV, I heard that the kids in Redmond plan         to cut Win95 piracy to zilch by requiring the use of a dongle. Yes, a dongle.      </p>
<p>         Just in case you've led a charmed or boring life, a dongle is a thingamajig that plugs         into one of your PC I/O ports. One dongle is shipped for each copy of the OS and the         software won't work if it can't detect the proper dongle.      </p>
<p>         The upshot of this plan is that you can load as many copies of Win95 as you like,         but only the machine with the dongle will work.      </p>
<p>         Now the requisite qualifiers, pre-paid backpedaling, and so on: I believe this information         to be true, but I have it from only one source, so it should be classified as a rumor. <u>Microsoft         could change its mind on the dongle security strategy tomorrow. </u>     </p>
</blockquote>
<p>         Emphasis mine. And the great thing is, if the story turns out untrue, you can even         take credit for it! "Thanks to public uproar over my amazing scoop, Microsoft changed         their mind and decided not to do this thing" (that they weren't planning on doing         anyway).      </p>
<p>         It's very frustrating reading rampant bogus rumors about your product and not being         able to do anything about it.      </p>
<p>         So remember, all you Lonhorn rumor-consumers: Just because you saw it in the newspaper         doesn't mean that it's true.      </p>

		<p>I find that hard to believe that public feedback makes in anywhere but a few nods of ok.</p>
<p>Windows XP Sp2 people want it more than ever now since the blaster&#8230;</p>
<p>So far its been a wait till 2004 attitude.</p>
<p>Looks like the whole world has no choice but to fill there add/remove with over 50 hotfixes by then.</p>
<p>AND longhorn, don&#8217;t get me started with that, I could give you a ton of feedback on it, but I doubt it would do much good.</p>

		<p>We so listen to feedback. I&#8217;ve been working on two customer requests for the past week. The Product Support teams product excellent summary reports for us on what sorts of things are causing the most problems.</p>
<p>I know how frustrating it is, though, to give feeback and get not much of a response beyond, &quot;Thanks for your feedback.&quot; We can&#8217;t really talk about what we&#8217;re doing to incorporate your feedback, but rest assured we got it.  Note also that we get lots of conflicting feedback, so a balance needs to be struck.  Your cool feature is somebody else&#8217;s support nightmare.</p>

		<p>I couldn&#8217;t see how a service pack being moved up the schedule could be bad for anyone?</p>
<p>except those who have to actually work on it :)</p>
<p>I understand your point of view, I guess after PDC and you MS folks can talk about Longhorn, can I be the first to email MY suggestions/annoyances.</p>

		<p>But if it used a dongle, what will be the fault?<br />
DO use a dongle! It&#8217;s your work, why not protecting it?</p>

		<p>Because dongles have some bloody annoying issues.</p>
<p>One other thing: why doesn&#8217;t any PR flacks from MS issue any statements on things like this? (I know there are legal reasons, but even a catch-all &quot;There are some very strange rumours being passed around. Please ignore them&quot; would suffice) These rumours just snowball because everyone takes MS&#8217;s stony silence as admittance of guilt.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
