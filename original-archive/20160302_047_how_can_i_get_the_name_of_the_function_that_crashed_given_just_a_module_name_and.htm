The only information a customer had regarding a crash was the
following:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
Faulting application name: Contoso.exe, version: 1.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x4a425e19<br>
Faulting module name: Contoso.exe, version: 1.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x4a425e19<br>
Exception code: 0xc0000005<br>
Fault offset: 0x000050d0<br>
Faulting process id: 0x1910<br>
Faulting application start time: 1cad18414e63580
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
They wanted to know what function crashed.
</p>
<p>
This is an application of
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/11/15/10468136.aspx">
techniques for restoring symbols to a stack trace
that was generated without symbols</a>,
but in the simplified case where there is only one address,
not an entire stack trace (so you need to do the work only once),
and in the special case where all you have is a module name and
an offset.
</p>
<p>
The first step is to find the correct executable.
The time stamp in the event log is
<code>0x4a425e19</code>,
which
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/05/54806.aspx">
we recognize</a>
as a UNIX style timestamp.
<a HREF="http://www.onlineconversion.com/unix_time.htm">
This handy online converter</a>
says that it's
June 24, 2009 at 17:10:49 GMT.
Dig into your archives and find a build generated around that
time and check the time stamp in the file header.
The <code>link /dump /headers</code> command will tell you:
</p>
<pre>
FILE HEADER VALUES
             14C machine (x86)
               3 number of sections
        <font COLOR="blue">4A1ECBC2</font> time date stamp Thu May 28 10:37:06 2009
</pre>
<p>
Okay, that's the wrong one since the time stamps don't match.
Keep looking until you find the right one,
and also grab its matching symbol file (<code>contoso.pdb</code>).
</p>
<p>
Once you do, you can load it up in the debugger.
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; ntsd -z contoso.exe

ModLoad: <font COLOR="blue">00100000</font> 00130000   contoso.exe

0:001&gt; u 0x00100000+0x50d0 L1
contoso!CViewReportTask::Run+0x102:
001050d0 8a18             mov     bl,[eax]  
</pre>
<p>
Okay, so at least you know that the crash was in the
<code>CView&shy;Report&shy;Task::Run</code> method.
You can also ask for line number information:
</p>
<pre>
0:001&gt; .lines
Line number information will be loaded
0:001&gt; u 0x00100000+0x50d0 L1
contoso!CViewReportTask::Run+0x102 [viewreporttask.cpp @ 250]:
001050d0 8a18             mov     bl,[eax]  
</pre>
<p>
We see that the crash was on line 250.
</p>
<p>
To figure out what part of line 250, you'll have to dig into
the disassembly and reverse-compile the code to see exactly
which part of line 250 is being executed at <code>001050d0</code>.
You don't know what value is in any of the registers,
so all you know is that the pointer is invalid; you don't know
whether it is null or wild, or how it got that way.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
You probably should sign up for
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn641144.aspx">
Windows Error Reporting</a>
so that you will receive crash dumps automatically,
which provide a full stack trace instead of a single address,
and it also captures register values and limited contents of the stack.
You can also ask for more information to be captured in future
crash dumps.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus exercise</b>:
Use your time stamp recognition skills to determine
what
<i>Faulting application start time</i>
corresponds to.</p>

		<p>Looks like Windows Error Reporting won&#8217;t let me receive crash dumps from my digitally signed applications in the wild: &#8220;The digital certificate is not from Symantec Inc. Only Symantec class 3 certificate is accepted&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I wish the fact that i have the private key corresponding to the digital signatures on the crash dumps sitting in WinQual was enough to prove that i signed those applications.</p>

		<p>Indeed so do I. Liars certificates are inherently adequate in this case.</p>

		<p>I have had this problem before, but it wasn&#8217;t an issue what certificate the executable is signed with.  It was just that the winqual service itself required a Symantec certificate.  Once I had signed up with winqual, the WER database accepted crash reports from my executables signed with non-Symantec certificates.  I&#8217;m using past tense here, since I cannot be certain this has not changed, but it seems doubtful.</p>

		<p>here&#8217;s an idea to cut the middleman out: create your own minidump file, then have your program sending it automatically to you via email (with the user&#8217;s consent of course).<br />

		<p>And then you get that one where the crash at the top of an unmapped page, and the previous page is backed by the pagefile. But oh look, the previous page starts to disassemble into something that looks like code about a third of the way down the page, and just stops in the middle.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
