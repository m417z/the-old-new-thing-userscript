One problem I discovered when my nieces ran my initial
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/07/08/10432277.aspx">
ABC program</a>
was that they had a habit of holding down a key,
thereby triggering autorepeat.
I had instructed them not to mash the keyboard but rather
to press only one key at a time,
and while they were good at adhering to the "one key at a time"
rule,
they also interpreted it as
"type really slowly"
and ended up autorepeating a lot.
</p>
<p>
So let's disable keyboard autorepeat.
</p>
<p>
Of course, one way to do this would be to change the system
keyboard autorepeat setting,
but that would be
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/11/9193695.aspx">
using global state to manage a local problem</a>.
Instead, we just filter the autorepeats out of our edit control:
</p>
<pre>
<font COLOR=blue>LRESULT CALLBACK EditSubclassProc(
    HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam,
    UINT_PTR uIdSubclass, DWORD_PTR dwRefData)
{
  switch (uMsg) {
  case WM_NCDESTROY:
    RemoveWindowSubclass(hwnd, EditSubclassProc, uIdSubclass);
    break;
  case WM_CHAR:
    if ((lParam &amp; 0x40000000) &amp;&amp; wParam != VK_BACK) return 0;
    break;
  }
    return DefSubclassProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
}</font>

BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
  ...

  <font COLOR=blue>SetWindowSubclass(g_hwndChild, EditSubclassProc, 0, 0);</font>
  SetWindowFont(g_hwndChild, g_hfEdit, TRUE);

  return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>
Bit 30 in the <code>lParam</code> of a
<code>WM_<wbr>CHAR</code> message
says whether the key was already down.
If we see that bit set,
then we know that the message was an autorepeat
and we throw the message away.
(But I let the backspace key through because that lets me
erase a lot of text quickly.)
</p>
<p>
It's important that the subclass procedure be removed before
the window is destroyed.
One way of doing this is to remove the subclass procedure
in the parent window's
<code>WM_<wbr>DESTROY</code> handler,
but since I don't have one,
and I'm too lazy to make one,
I go for the alternate method of doing just-in-time deregistration
by removing the subclass procedure in the subclass procedure itself.
</p>
<p>
This version of the
program managed to keep my nieces happy for quite some time.
We'll tinker with it some more next week.</p>

		<p>What&#39;s so bad about hotkeys? &nbsp;Your program hardly has any, and most of the Windows ones aren&#39;t particularly destructive.</p>

		<p>Mark: Your definition of &quot;destructive&quot; clearly doesn&#39;t anticipate young children (or cats, for that matter)! And remember, if something happens, they won&#39;t be able to tell you what they did.</p>
<p>For one thing, Win+D or Win+M just makes the whole program disappear. That&#39;s certainly destructive, if not permanent, but that alone means that you have to be there providing constant supervision.</p>
<p>Pressing Win+P can make your screen go black. Good luck figuring that one out!</p>
<p>Some OEM software has hotkeys for rotating the display. &quot;Uncle Raymond! The computer is upside down!&quot; If you don&#39;t know those hotkeys already, that&#39;s hard to fix with your screen upside down.</p>
<p>Win+E will bring up Explorer. Entering random keystrokes into Explorer can easily delete random files or give them random names, among other things.</p>
<p>Win plus a number will bring up whatever app is in that number&#39;s position on the task bar. I&#39;d hate to imagine what kind of havoc they could wreak with some important app that might be sitting haplessly minimized in Raymond&#39;s task bar. I suppose email could be the most destructive.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
