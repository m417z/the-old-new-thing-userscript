<p><a href="http://www.shultzys.com/"> Shultzy's Sausage</a> describes itself as "Seattle's Wurst Restaurant since 1989!" It's a local hangout for sausage, beer, chili, and advanced dishes like sausage with beer or sausage with chili.</p>
<p> In the early 1990's, Shultzy's expanded to a second location just a few blocks from Microsoft's main campus in Redmond, at a location known to my circle of friends as <i>the location of death</i>. </p>
<p> Many neighborhoods have a location of death: It's the location where there's a restaurant that can never manage to stay open. First it's a gyro restaurant. After a few months the gyro restaurant shuts down and a cr&ecirc;pe restaurant opens in its place. After another few months, the cr&ecirc;pe restaurant closes and a tea shop opens. You get the idea. It's not that we want the restaurants to fail. It's just that the location appears to be haunted. </p>
<p> Anyway, we wanted Shultzy's to succeed, so we made a point of going there semi-regularly. One evening, we went to the register and placed our orders, and the person behind the counter asked for a name to call when the order was ready. </p>
<p> Sometimes, when we went out to eat as a group and were feeling particularly whimsical, we'd all give the same name (Dave). Each time the name Dave was called, whoever felt lucky went to the counter to pick up the order. If the order was theirs, then they "won." It was cheap amusement, I admit. </p>
<p> Anyway, at this particular visit to Shultzy's, we did not play the Dave game. Each of us just gave our names. Except for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/15/9936830.aspx"> Bob</a>, who decided to be a bit of a smart aleck. When the person behind the counter asked, "What's your name?", Bob shot back, "What's <i>your</i> name?" </p>
<p> The person behind the counter calmly replied, "Shultzy." </p>
<p> Bob realized that he had just sassed the restaurant's owner and meekly replied, "My name's Bob." </p>
<p> Shultzy was gracious. "Thanks, Bob. I'll call you when your order's ready." </p>
<p> Even though Bob was only in his early 30's, he was a relative old-timer by Microsoft standards of the early 1990's. He perhaps should have recognized Shultzy, because Shultzy himself was featured in a full-page Microsoft advertisement a few years earlier touting how a small business uses Microsoft Excel to manage its day-to-day operations. </p>
<p> The location of death took another victim. The Shultzy's location near Microsoft main campus shut down after a few months. But the reason wasn't lack of business. Shultzy said that business at the new location was fine. Rather, he came to the conclusion that it was too much work to manage two locations, so he scaled his business back to its original size. </p>
<p> Today's article is in celebration of <a href="http://seattletimes.com/seattlerestaurantweek/"> Seattle Restaurant Week</a>. </p>

		<p>Yup, we have one of those locations down the street. It&#39;s odd considering it&#39;s a good location. Right on a main road. The building was just too large and too expensive to rent for a single restaurant I guess, so it&#39;s finally been split into another business and a restaurant and the current restaurant seems to be doing well (although I&#39;ve never personally visited it).</p>

		<p>This is well before my time in Redmond, but I&#39;d like to think this was on the corner of 148th and 124th, where there have been probably 6 restaurants in as many years. I&#39;m quite happy with the current establishment there, though, and am glad to see they seem to have some staying power.</p>

		<p>Now the guy who&#39;s actually named Dave has to give a false name so that he can get his order. &nbsp;I had a coworker who would always give &quot;Tonto&quot; as his name just in case there happened to be another Todd ordering at the same time.</p>

		<p>When one of the societies at my university reserves a table at the pub, it&#39;s reserved under &quot;Dave&quot;. A person called Dave doesn&#39;t always go, and there&#39;s nothing particularly special about Dave (as far as I know he isn&#39;t the person who books the table), but Dave is one of the easier names to dictate over the phone, compared to, say, &quot;SUWS&quot; (the name of the society) ;)</p>

		<p>Would-be restauranteurs would be wise to check out the history of a location before renting. &nbsp;Certain locations just don&#39;t work for restaurants, due to visibility, traffic flow, and other issues. &nbsp;If 3 restaurants failed at the location previously, it is probably for a reason.</p>

		<p>If it seems like an obviously good location, the landlord probably charges too much rent.</p>
<p>Or there is this building in Renton that cycles through restraunts, my brother-in-law managed a pizza place there, problem was sewage would back up out of the floor drains into the kitchen&#8230;</p>

		<p>Some family members detest this practice, so they give a name of &quot;Number 12&quot; or some other number. Using &quot;Number 6&quot; could trigger &quot;I am not a number, I am a free man&quot; responses in places.</p>

		<p>Back in the day, we had a friend of (I think) Dutch extraction whose name was memorable. &nbsp;We used that name even if he wasn&#39;t with us, because &quot;Table ready for Hoogerbeets&quot; is impossible to miss.</p>

		<p>Sometimes the restaurant just changes its name and theme. Probably this is a ruse to avoid creditors.</p>

		<p>When I was growing up there was a &quot;bad location&quot; place like that about a mile away from our house. &nbsp;A couple of restaurants failed in short order. &nbsp;Then it became a &quot;gentleman&#39;s club&quot; and it&#39;s been that ever since. &nbsp;And it&#39;s quite the dive on the outside!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
