<p>Recall that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/01/30/519388.aspx"> a corrupted program sometimes results in a "Program too big to fit in memory" error</a>. In response, Dog complained that while that may have been a reasonable response back in the 1980's, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/28/9379262.aspx#9383120"> in today's world, there's plenty of memory around for the MS-DOS emulator to add that extra check and return a better error code</a>.</p>
<p> Well yeah, but if you change the externally visible behavior, then you've failed as an emulator. The whole point of an emulator is to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/22/9244582.aspx"> mimic another world</a>, and any deviations from that other world can come back to bite you. </p>
<p> MS-DOS is perhaps one of the strongest examples of requiring absolute unyielding backward compatibility. Hundreds if not thousands of programs <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/24/6849530.aspx"> scanned memory looking for specific byte sequences inside MS-DOS so it could patch them or hunted around inside MS-DOS's internal state variables so it could modify them</a>. If you move one thing out of place, those programs stop working. </p>
<p> MS-DOS contains <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/18/44425.aspx#45248"> chunks of "junk DNA"</a>, code fragments which do nothing but waste space, but which exist so that programs which go scanning through memory looking for specific byte sequences will find them. (This principle is not dead; there's even some junk DNA in Explorer.) </p>
<p> Given the extreme compatibility required for MS-DOS emulation, I'm not surprised that the original error behavior was preserved. There is certainly some program out there that stops working if attempting to execute a COM-style image larger than 64KB returns any error other than 8. (Besides, if you wanted it to return some other error code, <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/74463"> you had precious few to choose from</a>.) </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
