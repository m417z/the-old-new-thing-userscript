<p>Some time ago, I described <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/04/28/122037.aspx"> what <code>__purecall</code> is for</a>: It's to detect the cases where you call a virtual method with no implementation (a so-called <i>pure virtual method</i>). This can happen during object constructor or destruction, since those are times when you can validly have a partially-implemented object.</p>
<p> Well, there's another case this can happen: If the object <i>has already been destructed</i>. </p>
<p> If you call a method on an object that has already been destructed, the behavior is undefined. In practice, what happens is that the method runs on whatever leftover values are in memory where the object used to be. Depending on how lucky or unlucky you are, this may resemble the actual object closely enough that the method doesn't notice, or at least doesn't notice for a while, or maybe it can't even get off the ground. </p>
<p> The <code>__purecall</code> error is a case where it can't even get off the ground. The leftover object still has a vtable, namely the vtable of the base class, the one that has <code>__purecall</code> entries for all the pure virtual functions. (It still has that vtable because that's the object's last identity before finally going invalid.) And the method you tried to call is a virtual method that is pure in the base class. Not only are you calling a pure virtual function after destruction has begun, you're calling it <i>after destruction is complete</i>. </p>

		<p>Actually Joshua, I would consider that better. &nbsp;A guaranteed crash right at the point of the problem is always better than undefined behavior that might seem to work sometimes. &nbsp;Actually that would be a good suggestion for the MSVC compiler if it doesn&#39;t already do that for debug builds.</p>

		<p>@Joshua, @SimonRev: How would you expect a compiler to achieve that? &nbsp;Zero out every object&#39;s memory after destruction? &nbsp;That would be a huge performance hit, something you&#39;d only want to do in a debug build.</p>

		<p>@Mc:</p>
<p>Since you state yourself that you are not a C++ expert, will you allow me to guess that your are more familiar with languages with automatic garbage collection, like C# and Java?</p>
<p>In C/C++ you must yourself explicitly release the memory you have allocated. There is nothing to prevent you from releasing an object to which there are still live references to it. If you do, that is your problem&#8230; (yafiygi)</p>

		<p>@Adam: &nbsp;Exactly, but not quite that extensive. &nbsp;The compiler is already messing with the vtable pointer during destruction. &nbsp;Just have it null out that pointer when destruction is complete. &nbsp;Obviously not something you want in a release build due to performance ramifications (and I am not sure whether it would be permitted by a strictly standard compliant compiler). &nbsp;But in a debug build, the cost to null out a pointer is minimal and the benefit to catching such errors may be worth it.</p>
<p>@Mc &#8212; C++&#39;s single biggest benefit over something like C# (IMO) is deterministic destruction of objects. &nbsp;But it does leave you vulnerable to using already destroyed objects if you ever save a reference or pointer to one. &nbsp;Adam&#39;s example is a bit obvious. &nbsp;Here is a more subtle one, especially if you have a C# background.</p>
<p>BaseClass &amp; GetABaseClass() {</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;DerivedClass retVal;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;return retVal;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>void DoSomething() {</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;BaseClass &amp;someObj = GetABaseClass();</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;someObj.VirtualMethod();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>This code has undefined behavior, because retVal is destroyed at the point of return from GetABaseClass. &nbsp;However, a reference lives on and gets used. &nbsp;In this case, there is a very good chance that the memory pattern occupied by retVal is still intact and calling VirtualMethod would result in a __purecall violation. &nbsp;However if the method were virtual but not pure virtual, then the method call might seem to succeed.</p>

		<p>@SimonRev: It filled NULLs into the vtable, so any means of calling a pure virtual function (say indirectly from base class constructor&#8211;direct call would be caught by compiler) would call NULL.</p>

		<p>@Joshua &#8212; while I believe it could NULL out the vtable pointer for an object instance, I cannot believe it would fill the vtable itself with NULLs. &nbsp;If it did that, then any live instances of the object would instantly die as all instances of the type share the same vtable.</p>

		<p>Note that in debug builds the runtime already overwrites freed dynamic memory with <code>0xdd</code> bytes (which is even better than setting the memory to zero). I don&#39;t think the compiler does anything similar for automatic objects that go out of scope (though newer ones can fill uninitialized locals with <code>0xcc</code>) . &nbsp;There might be value in that, but it&#39;s unclear to me how much bang for buck you&#39;d get.</p>

		<p>Using a replacement memory manager in Delphi (FastMM) we can compile with flags set that &#8211; among other useful things &#8211; cause the memory manager to write a specific bit pattern over any unallocated memory, including in destructed objects. &nbsp;At runtime this will then result in errors such as &quot;Attempt to call method on a destroyed object)&quot;, along with a stack trace of the attempted call and a stack trace of the destruction of the object.</p>
<p>If you inspect such an object (memory reference) using a bad reference in the debugger, it&#39;s classname is reported as a &quot;TFreedObject&quot;.</p>
<p>So finding such errors during development is made much easier (not bullet proof, as it is still possible that such deallocated memory might be re-allocated before the bad reference is used).</p>
<p>Neat huh ? &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>Well, we can do this as long as Embarcadero don&#39;t rewrite the EULA to stop us. &nbsp;:D</p>

		<p>@Gabe, Drak: Beyond disposed objects (which still have references to them and thus don&#39;t qualify for garbage collection) something called object resurrection can happen.</p>
<p>Situation: You have a finalizable object, i.e. the object&#39;s type declares a finalizer. When the object isn&#39;t referenced any more, the garbage collector runs the finalizer. In the finalizer code, a new reference to the object is added. Then the object survives garbage collection; it resurrects.</p>

		<p>Danny: I don&#39;t know what you mean. If I have a reference to an object, I can access it. The GC only collects objects that have no references, so there&#39;s no way to have a reference to a GCed object.</p>
<p>Ooh alludes to a way to have a reference to an object that has had its finalizer called, but such an object would still not have been GCed.</p>

		<p>I remeber hitting this some time ago with a &quot;role your own&quot; smartpointer implementation that would do an implicit upcast resulting in the destruction of the underlying object (which is why boost et al prevent this). The annoying thing about the pure virtual function call exception is that it throws up a dialog box! Instead of crashing, as would be the sane thing to do, and providing a nice call stack, you get a dialog that stops the program waiting for user input! What is the user going to do? Attach a debugger? (yes I am aware that it is possible to add your own handler to avoid this issue. Now I am). In this specific situation it was made worse because the program would continue to drive itself via the window message pump! We had just crashed, but kept right on going! We got a report from a customer saying &quot;why do we get this strange dialog?, if I ignore it every keeps on working.&quot; To decide to throw a dialog for a pure virtual function call was an insane idea; time to grab the torches and pitchforks people! </p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
