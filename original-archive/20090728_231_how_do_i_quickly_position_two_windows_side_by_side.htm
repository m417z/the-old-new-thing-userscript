<p>Commenter n/a posted <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/23/558887.aspx#559946"> a laundry list of feature requests</a>. I'm not going to address all of them here (though I inadvertently <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/03/4195888.aspx"> addressed one of them a while ago</a>). But today I'm going to address request number two, "A simple switch to create two windows, one alongside the other, vertically split."</p>
<p> That feature has been around since Windows&nbsp;95, possibly even before that but I haven't bothered to check. </p>
<p> In the taskbar, click the button for the first window you want to position, then hold the Ctrl key and right-click the button for the second window. Select <i>Tile Vertically</i>. Bingo, the two windows are positioned side by side. </p>
<p> (If you pick <i>Tile Horizontally</i> then they appear one above the other.) </p>
<p> Of course, the upcoming Windows&nbsp;7 makes this operation much easier with a set of window-positioning features that collectively are known as <i>Snap</i>. Just drag one window to the left edge of the screen, and drag the other to the right edge of the screen. But what if you don't want the windows to auto-dock? We'll pick that up next time. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: In case you missed it, the Engineering Windows 7 team blog the history of window arrangement in Windows in a multi-part series: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/10/01/user-interface-managing-windows-windows.aspx"> Part&nbsp;1</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/10/04/follow-up-managing-windows-windows.aspx"> Part&nbsp;2</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/03/17/designing-aero-snap.aspx"> Part&nbsp;3: Aero Snap</a>. </p>

		<p>That is so useful I can&#8217;t believe I never knew that. I used to minimise every window except the ones I wanted tiled then then chose tile from the taskbar&#8217;s context menu.</p>

		<p>I usually minimize all of the windows I don&#8217;t want involved, then just right-click in the task bar and select &quot;Tile Windows Vertically&quot; (or Horizontally). &nbsp;That will tile all of the non-minimized windows.</p>
<p>No messing around with clicking the taskbar icons, or remembering the ctrl-right click.</p>

		<p>The Windows 7 feature doesn&#8217;t work so well as soon as you have two monitors. Instead of two windows side-by-side you end up with one taking up the left half of one monitor, and one taking up the right half of the other monitor. Doesn&#8217;t anyone at Microsoft actually use dual monitors?</p>

		<p>Maybe I just can&#8217;t follow instructions, but I just tried clicking one button, then while holding down the CTRL key, right clicking a second button in Windows 7 RC. No dice.

		<p>I use Sizer by Brian Apps to control window sizes. He has a new beta version for Vista/7 up at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.brianapps.net/sizer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.brianapps.net/sizer/</a> .</p>
<p>Highlights: new system menu or right-click on max button/border to access a customizable list of window sizes and/or positions; tooltip shows window size as it is being sized.</p>
<p>This little utility is essential for seeing how your web page or sizable dialog will look at different screen sizes.</p>

		<p>Of course I&#8217;m talking about the situation when taskbar buttons are ungrouped in Windows 7 and like in all previous Windows versions. So the idea is to force users to prefer the grouping option as it gives more options like &quot;Close group&quot; which you don&#8217;t get by ungrouping. Well done MS!</p>

		<p>Hrm.. I dislike grouping because I like my window buttons to have spatial sense &#8211; e.g., the leftmost button is Outlook, followed by two terminal programs (one for each serial port, with the left one being the window on the left, the right one on the right), followed by three ssh sessions into my Linux box&#8230;</p>

		<p>Ugh, smoked by one minute.</p>
<p>If you have any RDP sessions open, executing this tiling feature on *other* windows will cause *all* RDP sessions windows to get swept up and made small in the upper-left corner of your main window. &nbsp;Bizarre!</p>

		<p>The ability to *select* taskbar window buttons using Ctrl+left click and right click on the last as Raymond Chen describes is removed from Windows 7. See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_removed_in_Windows_7#Windows_Shell" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_removed_in_Windows_7#Windows_Shell</a>. Steven Sinofsky confirm this to me in an email giving a silly unjustified reason that it was removed because the common menu that appears after selecting taskbar buttons &quot;wouldn&#8217;t apply to jump lists&quot;!!! (WTH?)</p>

		<p>I join the crowd of those who didn&#8217;t know about this feature before. It works well.</p>
<p>Now what makes you think that dragging two windows to relatively precise locations could possibly be easier? What makes you think that dragging is ever easier than hitting keys?</p>

		<p>Is there a way to do this trick without using mouse? Ctrl+spacebar doesn&#8217;t work as it does in explorer.</p>

		<p>Excellent! It even handles multi-monitors properly! &nbsp;Thank you.</p>
<p>Now if I could only figure out a way to break MDI windows out of their parent (Esp. Visual Studio) and onto the other screen, I&#8217;d be in multi-monitor heaven.</p>

		<p>@July 28, 2009 4:59 PM by Olivier:</p>
<p>As anon subsequently pointed out, I was referring to the exact feature Raymond describes using the CTRL+CLICK.</p>
<p>The ability to CTRL+Click on a taskbar button is gone, even if you turn off button grouping.</p>
<p>Yes, &quot;Show windows stacked&quot; option exists on the taskbar itself (not when clicking a button), and it only works for all visible windows not the specific windows you want stacked.</p>
<p>Aero Snap works for two windows pretty easily once you get the hang of the hotkeys, but of course the ability to quickly position THREE windows side by side is gone (previously, you would CTRL+Click all three, right-click-&gt;show windows side by side / stacked), and also the &quot;Undo show windows side by side&quot; does not exist in the Aero Snap case.</p>
<p>A big problem here is that many people&#8217;s language reads left to right, or right to left. If I&#8217;m referencing a document while typing I like to position the reference below the window I am typing in so that my eyes can skip down and then immediately back to the spot where I was typing.</p>
<p>Doing this work with &quot;show windows side by side&quot;, it is quite annoying to have to move my eyes past text I have written to find the other window, and then turn my eye movement 90 degrees (up or down&#8230; coin flip) to find the information of interest, only to realize I need to look the opposite direction, or even worse&#8230; be required to scroll the window horizontally! Ugh.</p>
<p>In contrast with the window stacked, I can quickly scan down the page absorbing the entire width of the line peripherally and find what I want. No horizontal scrolling, no changing scan direction, etc.</p>
<p>(and no, I&#8217;m not this crazy about my eye movements in practice, I&#8217;m just trying to express in detail why Aero Snap side by side doesn&#8217;t solve the scenario which stacked solved and why this change causes some small pains in managing my window positions.)</p>
<p>If WIN+UP/WIN+DOWN would be changed to support an Aero Snap version of stacked, that would be a BIG usability win IMHO.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s quite a nice feature and I found myself using it quite often&#8230; until I found WinSplit Revolution, which give me a bit more control and keyboard shortcuts.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
