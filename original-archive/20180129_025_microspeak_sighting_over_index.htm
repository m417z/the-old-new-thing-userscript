<p>
The other day, I heard the Microspeak term <i>over-index</i>
used in the wild.
It's like birdwatching, but for words.
</p>
<p>
In
<a HREF="https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=581128170">
a brief interview with Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman</a>,
they talked about the significance of
having Amazon headquartered in your city.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
And Amazon can take some of the wealth
of Seattle or Silicon Valley
and bring it to the center of the country,
and that can be really good.
But I think people are <u>overindexed</u> on Amazon.
There's going to be Apple,
and then there's going to be Dropbox,
and there's going to be Intel. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The term here is being used in the Microspeak way:
Given too much prominence in a discussion.
He's saying that people are focusing too much on Amazon
and missing the other companies.</p>

		<p>But <i>why</i> an &#8220;index?&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a perfectly cromulent CS term that applies here: it&#8217;s called a &#8220;reference.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can have strong references, weak references,  phantom references, and I forget the other one but it&#8217;s a reference anyhow.  That&#8217;s, like, <b>four</b> uses of references in a Powerpoint presentation.</p>
<p>Beats indexing by a factor of two (if you include direct indexing and, say, Trie referencing).</p>

		<p>What meaning of the word &#8220;reference&#8221; do you mean? I can&#8217;t think of any that makes sense in this context in any way (for me from a more theoretical CS pov a reference is a piece of data that allows the retrieval of some other data &#8211; but we aren&#8217;t referencing anything here)</p>
<p>The word index on the other hand has a rather obvious connection. To quote the oxford dictionary:</p>
<p>2. A sign or measure of something.<br />
‘exam results may serve as an index of the teacher&#8217;s effectiveness’</p>
<p>I can see how you arrive at &#8220;overindex&#8221; from that.</p>

		<p>In a database, if you <i>over-index</i>, you end up a) wasting space, b) wasting machine cycles (inserts take longer), c) getting very little benefit (by definition, if something is over-indexed, you don&#8217;t need the index you just created) and finally d) make something seem more important than it really is.<br />
In the context of the Amazon HQ2 quote, that actually pretty closely matches the point of what Mr. Kelman is trying to say.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s probably from the economic term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)" rel="nofollow">index</a> (it could also be from statistics, but is more likely the economic version.) Overindexing would be favouring one group of data over other groups.</p>
<p>Just in case the previous comment was in jest: :-)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m glad you added the clarification of the meaning. I initially read it the other way around, as saying that people were being given too much prominence by Amazon, which given the stories I&#8217;ve heard about the working conditions in the warehouses seems to indicate a race to the bottom in terms of treating people with a bit of basic respect.</p>

		<p>Based on your definition, it sounds like Amazon is the one that&#8217;s overindexed — not people. But that&#8217;s not what Kelman is saying.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
