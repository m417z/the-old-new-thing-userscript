<p>On <a href="http://footnoted.org/">footnoted.org</a>, Michelle Leder reads the fine print in all those SEC filings, focusing on the details that companies try to hide from vigilant eyes. For example, she dug into Carnival Corp's proxy statement and discovered "that Chairman and CEO Micky Arison rang up $343K on his use of the corporate jet last year and that COO Howard Frank spent $321K," up from $215K and $101K last year, respectively. My favorite example of corporate jet-setting is <a href="http://footnoted.org/a-day-at-the-beach/"> this one on Applebee's former CEO Lloyd Hill</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> On 29 occasions from from April 2006 through January 2007, Applebees's corporate aircraft flew into and out of Galveston, Texas, where former CEO Lloyd Hill happens to own a beach house. The nearest Applebees's restaurant is more than 40 miles away. Though Mr. Hill ceased to be CEO in September 2006, company planes continue the Galveston shuttle. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <a href="http://footnoted.org/and-the-oscar-goes-to/"> The current record-holder for personal use of the corporate jet</a> is George David, Chairman and CEO of United Technologies (UTX), who spent over $600,000 of his company's money on personal flights. (And check out that $194,099 under "Cash Flexible Perquisite Allowances"! Isn't "cash perquisite" an oxymoron?) </p>
<p> Another web site that reads the fine print is <a href="http://www.mouseprint.org/"> mouseprint*</a>, which looks at the fine print in consumer products. It could be simple things like <a href="http://www.mouseprint.org/?p=136"> a gallon can of paint that is less than a gallon</a> and <a href="http://www.mouseprint.org/?p=122"> a quart of mayonnaise that is less than a quart</a>. Or it could be pointing out that Scott's 1000-sheet toilet paper, billed as having "improved long-lasting value," is actually <a href="http://www.mouseprint.org/?p=114"> 7.5% shorter than the old roll</a>. </p>
<p> Mouseprint* also found lacking <a href="http://www.mouseprint.org/?p=111"> the defense of Gorilla Glue against charges of making the unsubstantiated claim that they make "the toughest glue on planet earth</a>." The defense? The claim is "so broad in scope, so general in nature, and so exaggerated in content, that no reasonable consumer would believe it to be a superiority claim." </p>
<p> In other words, "You'd have to be an idiot to believe us!" </p>

		<p>Raymond, sorry for asking this in the comments. I searched your blog but cold not find your contact info or the answer to this question. Why can&#8217;t we reorder the buttons in the taskbar as we please? Maybe by dragging them around. I have to use Taskbar Shuffle for that.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that back in the &#8217;60s, maybe even &#8217;50s, <em>Mad Magazine</em> ran an article on the downsizing of the nickel Hersheys Bar. Thay may well have been the first introduction of many a kid to investigative journalism</p>

		<p>Is &quot;toughest glue&quot; a verifiable claim? i.e. is &quot;tough&quot; a verifiable quality pertaining to glue? In my mind, it&#8217;s similar to all those commercials saying we&#8217;re the &quot;number 1 blah blah blah&quot;. Number 1 in what? &nbsp;</p>

		<p>IIRC, the &quot;we&#8217;re number 1&quot; thing legally means that there&#8217;s no effective difference between most of the commercial products, and they&#8217;re tied for number 1.</p>

		<p>To be fair to Sergio, it looks like the contact form was disabled due to spam.</p>
<p>I guess maybe this also applies to those irritating Axe Body Spray commercials. &nbsp;You&#8217;ve got to be a complete idiot to believe the insinuations they make. &nbsp;I suppose that technically they never state any claims, so they are probably off the hook from a legal point of view. &nbsp;I do wonder if any women are offended by them, though.</p>

		<p>Right, BryanK, I hear that claim that &quot;no pain reliever is better on tough headaches&quot; and such all the time. &nbsp;They are all equally good.</p>
<p>Some of them are cheaper, though! &nbsp;Such as the generic aspirin/acetaminophen/ibuprofen/whatever, &nbsp;that is probably made in one of the same factories that the brand-name painkillers are made in, but the companies don&#8217;t have to pay for TV ads.</p>

		<p>Bryank: &nbsp;There are lots of kinds of pain killers now &#8212; besides the Tylenol type, there&#8217;s the Ibuprofen type (Advil/Motrin), and there&#8217;s Ketoprofen that many people haven&#8217;t heard of. &nbsp;There are several others also.</p>
<p>Tylenol doesn&#8217;t do anything for me. &nbsp;Luckily, ibuprofen does.</p>

		<p>Sergio: &nbsp;The feature is not there so as to keep from over complicating the UI. &nbsp;The average user has enough trouble with the task bar as it is, if they held their mouse button down and stuff starting moving, it would make life even more complicated!</p>
<p>Honestly, the need for that feature is quite rare. &nbsp;I myself use TaskbarShuffle because I do indeed have enough applications open that being able to sort them into little mini-categories is nice, but for most other users, it is not a concern.</p>
<p>An interface that exposes every possible option is not an interface you want to use for too long. &nbsp;Of course, you can always go over to Linux and KDE, where everything is configurable! :) &nbsp;KDE is also a UI mess, every program has pages and pages of options for configuring every aspect of its UI.</p>
<p>Of course, Windows does leave the ability open to third parties utilities to enable additional functionality, and anyone who wants to do something like rearrange taskbar items will soon find out how!</p>

		<p>Number one is the ultimate in defenseable claims. &nbsp;You suggest to the consumer that your product is the best but when that lands you in court you can state to the judge that you were equating your product with p*ss.</p>
<p>&quot;Your honor, our product is substandard, p*ss poor if you will. &nbsp;It always has been, it always will be, as we can&#8217;t turn a profit if we improve the quality. &nbsp;Rather than promote our product with fraudulent or dubious claims however, we&#8217;ve chosen to embrace the open and honest policy of describing the product quality accurately and letting the market decide its worth. &nbsp;Each and every commercial and advertisement we&#8217;ve ran has clearly equated the product&#8217;s quality with p*ss. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the FCC, other censoring agencies, and marketing partners don&#8217;t allow use of the word p*ss in their ads. &nbsp;That&#8217;s forced us to use the common alternative description &quot;number 1.&quot; &nbsp;If anyone should be held liable for any consumer confusion it&#8217;s these outside agencies.&quot;</p>

		<p>&quot;Isn&#8217;t &quot;cash perquisite&quot; an oxymoron&quot;</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/07/26.html" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/07/26.html</a></p>
<p>perquisite PUR-kwuh-zit, noun:</p>
<ol>
<li>A profit or benefit in addition to a salary or wages.</li>
<li>
<p>Broadly: The benefits of a position or office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A gratuity or tip for services performed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anything to which someone has or claims the sole right.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the term is designed to hide what&#8217;s going from shareholders. If you report stuff like this in a way that most people won&#8217;t understand you have less chance of ending up like a recent right wing newspaper tycoon. Not sure if I can name him here, but he was busted for using money from of &#8216;his&#8217; company for personal reasons by the other shareholders.</p>

		<p>Anon: &nbsp;ah, but look at the actual definitions page, not the WotD one:</p>
<ol>
<li>an incidental payment, benefit, privilege, or advantage over and above regular income, salary, or wages: &lt;i&gt;Among the president&#8217;s perquisites were free use of a company car and paid membership in a country club. &lt;/i&gt;</li>

		<p>OFF topic:</p>
<p>&quot;Guess what, the 64 bit edition isn&#8217;t twice as good, it&#8217;s half the driver support.&quot;</p>
<p>That is a million times as good as far as i&#8217;m concerned. &nbsp;I means that if i dont find a 64 vista driver for device x, i wont buy it. &nbsp;If the company hasn&#8217;t bothered to put thier drivers through cert, they must not care enough about the product for me to use it.</p>
<p>If a hardware/software company hasn&#8217;t paid attention to the new driver model that has been comming for an eon. &nbsp;DON&#8217;T USE THIER JUNK!</p>
<p>John: &nbsp;The wow doesn&#8217;t start now. &nbsp;It starts a while after x-mass when WPF apps start hitting the shelves.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
