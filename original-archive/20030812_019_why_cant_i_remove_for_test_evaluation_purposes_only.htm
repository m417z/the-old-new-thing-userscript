<p>         "Why can't I remove 'for test/evaluation purposes only'? I know I'm running an evaluation         edition, I don't need it rubbed in my face."      </p>
<p>         This prevents unscrupulous OEMs from selling machines with the evaluation edition         of the product instead of the retail version. (Yes, this has happened before. Many         times.)      </p>
<p>         The "For test purposes only" tag prevents unscrupulous OEMs from selling machines         with uncertified drivers. (Driver-cheating has been a big problem, especially video         drivers, since... well... forever. Those of you who are gamers know all about driver         cheating.) To install an uncertified driver without a warning prompt, you need to         install the test root certificate. The presence of the test root certificate causes         the "For test purposes only" tag to appear.      </p>
<p>         We have also had many cases of corporate customers (and technology reporters!) who         have had machines expire because they had forgotten that they were running the evaluation         edition.&nbsp; When the machines expire on them, they are&nbsp;stuck with thousands         of machines that don't work. This makes them extremely upset.      </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
