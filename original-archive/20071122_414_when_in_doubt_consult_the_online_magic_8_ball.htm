<p>On our team's web site, buried among the other debugging documents, was a page titled simply "Magic 8 Ball"&reg;&sup1;. If you visited it, you got a dark blue circle with a lighter-blue triangle, on which appeared white text with a randomly-chosen message. The messages were things like</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory corruption. </li>
<li>Try a newer build. </li>
<li>Known bug. </li>
<li>Can't connect. </li>
<li>Hardware failure. </li>
<li>Looks like a X bug. (Where "X" was a random component.) </li>
</ul>
<p> It was fun to give the 8-ball a shake, but the real purpose of the 8-ball was to be a link sent out in response to failure reports. </p>
<p> You see, there was a secret URL for each of the 8-ball's responses, so you could respond to a failure report with something like </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> The Magic 8 ball says...  http://internalserver/magic8.asp?TWVGS </p>
</blockquote>
<p> and when the person clicked on the link, they got an 8-ball that said "Known bug" or "Memory corruption". </p>
<p> Some teams liked the 8-Ball's responses so much, they asked us to add new custom messages to the repertoire. </p>
<p> Anyway, I was reminded of this by <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6118099"> the story of Radio8Ball</a>. </p>
<p> &sup1;Magic 8-Ball is a registered trademark of Tyco Toys, Inc. When the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2584675.stm"> Tyco scandal</a> hit the airwaves, I always did a double-take before realizing that it was a different company. </p>
<ul>
<li>Tyco International = scandal-plagued multinational conglomerate,     cursed by shareholders. </li>
<li>Tyco Toys = a division of Mattel, maker of the Magic 8 Ball,     beloved by soothsayers. </li>
</ul>

		<p>Szajd is telling the truth. &nbsp;They have no electricity. &nbsp;On our side of the river though we have electricity. &nbsp;Szajd reads Old New Thing in newspaper, forwards a reply via smoke signals and I post it for him. Hard to read his messages on windy days like today. &nbsp;:(</p>

		<p>Szajd&#8217;s stand-in shares only part of the truth. &nbsp;He has electricity but no Internet &#8211; only telegraph. &nbsp;He read Szajd&#8217;s message, walks to telegraph office, sends to me on modern side of country. &nbsp;I do have Internet. &nbsp;It visit me daily in how you say donkey cart. &nbsp;I post message for Szajd&#8217;s, Szajd&#8217;s stand-in, and myself.</p>
<p>We all very thanksgiving for your column Raymond. &nbsp;Most of all Szajd. &nbsp;When electricity finally make it to his village in 2015 he plan to be Windows 98 Programming Guru.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s amusing. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve often used this form of reply for bugs I&#8217;ve looked at (usually when I&#8217;ve only had a quick glance at the code or even am just recalling the code from memory, but sometimes after a more in-depth investigation too).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never had a website to back up my responses, though. &nbsp;Maybe I should make one :)</p>

<p>Raymond&#8217;s one is pretty cool, but there&#8217;s something cool about knowing it&#8217;s a real thing you&#8217;re looking at :-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
