		<p>I&#39;ve always wanted to see pyrotechnics during a fire drill, with smoke.</p>
<p>What good is a test, after all, if it doesn&#39;t replicate real-world conditions? One of the worst tragedies of 9/11 was that most people could&#39;ve been saved if they hadn&#39;t become panicky animals the moment something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>Same for all emergencies, really. As soon as there&#39;s some smoke, people begin to trample each other to death.</p>
<p>Alternately, we should play &quot;This is a Drill&quot; messages during every emergency.</p>

		<p>@Anon, what are you talking about? &nbsp;What panicky animals? &nbsp;Most people did get out. &nbsp;The ones who didn&#39;t were mainly the ones above the plane impacts, who couldn&#39;t get out because the stairwells were on fire.</p>

		<p>@Anon,</p>
<p>I am not able to recall many specific envents from my grade school years, 45+ years ago, but one that still stands clear in my memory is the fire drill with real fire trucks and sierens and &quot;the works&quot;. And they had placed this huge, flat steel tray &#8211; it must have been at least fifteen feet square &#8211; in the schoolyard, pouring gasoline and oil into it, and set in on fire, letting it really catch, with heavy black smoke, before they showed us how they could put it out using foam fire extinguishers. (No, they did NOT use water with burning oil/gasoline!).</p>
<p>I think that display tops the list of memorable events from my grade school years. It did give us a real-life feeling of what a real fire looks like &#8211; the intense heat, the smoke, the noise from the burning. Without being a spectactular new-years-style firework, but something showing us the true power of a big fire. The stuff they call &quot;silent knowledge&quot; &#8211; the things that cannot be learnt from reading a textbook; you learn it only by personal experience, by being there. Fortunately, we could do this learning in a controlled environment, at a low risk. Still I think it made all of us understand a lot better what a real fire is really about.</p>

		<p>@Ken: I think it&#39;s good. If you pre-announced there&#39;s a drill, people often refuse to move. I remembered a fire drill a few years ago at IFC here, less than one-third of people working inside running out to the instructed &quot;safe place&quot;.</p>
<p>You need to frighten or cause panic to people in order to get the real performance at drills. Just remember to send apologies afterwards and I&#39;ll be fine with that.</p>

		<p>@cheong00 I was on the phone to my boss when there was a fire drill. Things didn&#39;t end well.</p>

		<p>@Neil: When your building is known to have fire drills that&#39;s not pre-announced, just make sure you send the &quot;after drill&quot; later sent by building managements to your boas and it should be fine.</p>
<p>How-the-H can you know whether it&#39;s a drill or not?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
