		<p>I agree. They are educational, despite not being systematic or goal-oriented. It&#8217;s far better writing about your own dreams after all.</p>

		<p>All my work (well 95%) is CLR. These posts are always interesting. In particular you bring the perspective of where the CLR abstraction rubber meets the win32 road. I would welcome more</p>

<p>And Raymond, thank you very much for &#8220;wasting your time&#8221; constantly blogging for almost a decade-and-a-half and counting! It&#8217;s always a joy to read, even though I do little-to-no Win32 or CLR programming on a regular basis.</p>

		<p>Well, it seems my sarcasm has passed under the radar :-( . Yes, StackOverflow is sometimes useful. And yes, Raymond seems to have an account there *and* use it. What I find amusing is that StackOverflow usually is a place where beginner programmers (and those not worth their salaries) come for a quick, copy-and-paste solution to their problems, while Raymond&#8217;s The Old New Thing takes the opposite approach, centering on the how and the why of things.</p>

		<p>Why do inherited .NET COM interfaces have to specify the entire vtable down to IUnknown or IDispatch rather than just the new methods that are added to the base interface like in C++?</p>

		<p>But that begs the question, why is D the suffix for double, since C managed without it&#8230;</p>

		<p>Because a numeric literal can be ambiguous. &#8220;5&#8221; parses as an int, a float, a double or a decimal. The compiler will use the &#8220;lightest&#8221; of these types, so &#8220;5&#8221; is an int. If you want it to be interpreted as floating-point instead, &#8220;5f&#8221; is a float, &#8220;5d&#8221; is a double, &#8220;5m&#8221; is a decimal. Before writing this, I did some testing, and I had thought that e.g. &#8220;3.14&#8221; would parse to float because it doesn&#8217;t require too many digits of precision, but my testing proved me wrong; while any integer literal will be an int by default, any literal with a decimal point will be a double by default.</p>

		<p>Sure, but any int can be cast into a double anyway, so it only matters if you&#8217;re doing manual overload resolution, at which point you should probably be explicitly casting anyway.</p>

		<p>&#8220;M was chosen simply as the next best letter in decimal&#8221;. By that point, M is meaningless. It&#8217;s just a random letter. It&#8217;s not like a menu keyboard shortcut where the letter can be underlined.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
