		<p>Not literally&#8230; </p>
<p>What I think happens is that the heart detects a higher than normal blood pressure due to the accumulation of blood in the chess cavity and triggers the kidneys to release some liquid out of the system. The kidneys are still producing the urine.</p>

		<p>I concur. &nbsp;That&#8217;s what I take from this. &nbsp;Effectively she donated a quart of plasma, just as if she had gone into the Red Cross and given up a quart of plasma (plasma&lt;&gt;Red Blood cells). &nbsp;Which is a fair amount of plasma (in terms of TOTAL blood volume, roughly 20%.) &nbsp;While this isn&#8217;t a 1:1 ratio (after all she didn&#8217;t lose RBCs) &nbsp;But still.</p>
<p>What confuses me is why the blood seems to collect in the Chest Cavity. &nbsp;Blood defies gravity all the time (think legs and head.) &nbsp;So it sems to me that a lack of gravity would be a good thing. &nbsp;Of course I suppose gravity may in the end aid blood.</p>

		<p>tsrblke: Actually what happens is that in normal gravity, blood tends to pool in the lower half of your body. But in zero gravity, the opposite happens (because your ciculatory system evolved in the presence of gravity, it has a slight tendency to pump blood UP). So you face and chest get all the blood, while you legs don&#8217;t get very much.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s kind of like when you stand on your head. &nbsp;All the blood rushes up because your body is used to pumping blood in to your head, not out of it.</p>
<p>It makes you wonder, if you stood on your head for a few months straight, would your body get used to it and then feel weird and dizzy when you stood up normal again?</p>

		<p>Hi, Brian<br />
<br />There is an answer to your question. You won&#8217;t just feel dizzy. It is an ancient Chinese way to kill a man simply by giving him a full meal and then forcing him in a head down position for a few hours.<br /></p>

		<p>Actually, you will notice this when you get cold as well. &nbsp;Your body concentrates blood in your core and there is a procedure to get rid of the excess fluid by urination. That&#8217;s why you pee in the pool so much and why scuba divers smell the way they do.</p>

		<p>The first commenter is absolutely correct. &nbsp;When there is too much fluid the heart released Atrial Naturetic Peptide (ANP) which increases urination.</p>
<p>The reason the blood pools in your chest isn&#8217;t gravity, its pressure. &nbsp;When your chest expands to breathe in, there is negative pressure in your chest, this sucks both air and blood into your chest cavity. &nbsp;Exhalation, if you are not exercising, is passive and does not involve huge pressure gradients. &nbsp;(If you happen to make your living by doing physical exams on children, you can hear a really neat double heart sound when they breathe in, its due to this same phenomenon.)</p>
<p>And to brian, unfortunately the answer is yes, but you don&#8217;t even have to stand on your head. &nbsp;I had the misfortune of spending two weeks of my life either flat or with my head below my feet (trendelenburg&#8217;s position) after a mistake during brain surgery left a leak in my spinal cord. &nbsp;It took me over a week to be able to stand up again without getting dizzy. &nbsp;(This is also very well documented in medical literature, but the personal experience is a lot more interesting.)</p>

		<p>&quot;From 25 to 66 percent of all astronauts cannot stand for 10 minutes following space flight of up to two weeks&quot;</p>

<p>If you think about it, you answered your own question. &nbsp;Since the vascular system is designed to return blood to the heart *despite* gravity, when that gravity is absent it becomes all the more efficient at doing its job.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
