<p>
A customer liaison asked whether
DDE and the
<code>WM_<wbr>COPY&shy;DATA</code> message
were related as IPC mechanisms.
Specifically, are they dependent on each other,
or are they independent?
</p>
<p>
The two communications mechanisms are independent.
I mean, sure, they are related in the sense that they
both use window messages,
but there is no cross-dependency between them.
You can use one without the other,
and neither depends on the other.
</p>
<p>
In practice, 
you are likely to see one or the other, but not both.
Very old programs will use DDE,
because
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140509-00/?p=1033">
DDE was invented first</a>.
Newer programs will use <code>WM_<wbr>COPY&shy;DATA</code>
and ignore DDE because
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070226-00/?p=27863">
you are free to stop using DDE</a>.
</p>
<p>
The customer liaison explained that
the customer has a very old suite of applications
which they are trying to migrate off their
Windows Server 2003&sup1; systems to
Windows Server 2008 R2,
but the programs are getting into
a hung state after an extended period of use.
Looking at the memory dumps (filled with
many ancient components, some provided from a third party,
for which they have no symbols),
reveals that
two of the processes appear to be stuck sending
a <code>WM_<wbr>COPY&shy;DATA</code> message.
The customer claims that their programs
communicate with DDE, not
<code>WM_<wbr>COPY&shy;DATA</code>,
which led to the customer liaison asking if
DDE and
<code>WM_<wbr>COPY&shy;DATA</code> were somehow
interdependent.
</p>
<p>
The two are not interdependent.
They are two different ways of performing
inter-process communication.
Fortunately, <code>WM_<wbr>COPY&shy;DATA</code> is
easier to debug than DDE
because
<code>WM_<wbr>COPY&shy;DATA</code> is a synchronous
message.
If a
<code>WM_<wbr>COPY&shy;DATA</code> is stuck,
you can extract the window that is the target of the message,
get the thread responsible for that window,
and then study that thread to see why it is not responding.
</p>
<p>
My guess is that the customer has existing code that
has taken a lock (let's call it Lock&nbsp;A),
and then did something that processes
inbound sent messages,
say entering a message loop
or sending a cross-thread message.
While the thread is pumping messages or waiting for the
cross-thread <code>Send&shy;Message</code> to complete,
another thread sends a
<code>WM_<wbr>COPY&shy;DATA</code> message,
and now the window procedure is being re-entered.
The
<code>WM_<wbr>COPY&shy;DATA</code> message
tries to take a different lock (let's call it Lock&nbsp;B), and blocks.
Meanwhile, the owner of Lock&nbsp;B wants to take
Lock&nbsp;A, and we now have a deadlock.
Reason:
Pumping messages (or sending messages between threads)
while holding a lock
creates a lock inversion opportunity.
Inspection of the stuck stack would reveal whether any window
procedure re-entrancy is active.
</p>
<p>
This is a timing bug that could be the sort of thing
exposed by a change in OS.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus trivia</b>:
A colleague tells me that the
<code>WM_<wbr>COPY&shy;DATA</code> message
was originally added in order to support
the 32-bit version of MS Mail on the initial builds
of Windows NT.
Obviously, other people found other uses for the message since then.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
That is not a typo.
They are running on a 13-year-old operating system
which exited extended support over a year ago.</p>

		<p>The source OS of Win2003 didn&#8217;t surprise me so much as the target. If you&#8217;re going to update a program to work on a new OS&#8230; why not just go to the latest? Going to an OS that is no longer in mainstream support seems counter-intuitive to me. I realize that there is always an issue of Time, Money, People in getting things ported&#8230; but still.</p>

		<p>If we&#8217;re very lucky, it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re taking small steps rather than one giant leap and that this is just the beginning of their modernization process. I doubt we&#8217;re that lucky though and look forward to the blog post in 2022 talking about migrating away from Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2.</p>

		<p>Once you make it past Server 2008 you&#8217;ve already made the NT6.0 leap and that&#8217;s the big one. The rest shouldn&#8217;t be too hard in theory. Is it marginally more than NT6.1? Yes, but not enough to justify holding yourself back when the overall benefit is much larger. But I suspect you&#8217;re correct and they are doing this out of an overabundance of caution.</p>

		<p>Porting an old version of our app form Windows Server 2003 to Windows Server 2008 R2 required exactly 1 hitpoint provided you were willing to turn UAC completely off. Windows Server 2008 R2 is the last OS on which you can do that reasonably without breaking too much.</p>
<p>We did eventually track down the UAC problems one by one. The final solution was don&#8217;t install in program files anymore to keep away from folder redirection. (Even that ancient version already didn&#8217;t require any privileges; however it still depends pretty hard on the classical model of filesystems, that is all programs see exactly the same version of the disk.) We were forced out of Program Files on Windows Server 2003 x64 for the same reason.</p>

		<p>Yuck.  I would hate to have to rely on programs that don&#8217;t work well when things are installed in Program Files directory (or the x86 one). </p>
<p>I recently dealt with a program that wanted to install into the root of C, requiring a path with no spaces (and even documenting this fact, like &#8220;We don&#8217;t understand how to use paths properly and we can&#8217;t be bothered to learn&#8221;).  I decided not to use that program at all.</p>

		<p>The problem *is* folder redirection. The program gets upset when it hands off files to other arbitrary programs and they can&#8217;t find them because they have manifests that result in different folder redirections. I asked for a flag I could set on a folder to exempt it (like registry has) and was refused.</p>

		<p>Use handles, then folder redirection isn&#8217;t an issue? Regardless you&#8217;ll still have to deal with the problem. Moving things around is just delaying the inevitable, better to fix it properly now particularly since Server 2008 R2 only has 3 years of support left.</p>

		<p>How does (not) installing to Program Files affect folder redirection? System32 will be redirected to SysWow64 for 32-bit programs regardless of where they&#8217;re installed (there&#8217;s no redirection for Program Files), and folder virtualization only affects programs that don&#8217;t have Vista manifest.</p>

		<p>Easy. I don&#8217;t place any files in system32 or syswow64. Folder redirection works fine for OS-provided files.</p>

		<p>My guess is they have a park of servers with different OS. The fact that Server 2003 is no longer supported is probably what is forcing them to upgrade that program. I&#8217;d guess they kept the old servers around for so long because that program would not run on newer versions. Now, they decided they have to face the music a figure out what was the source of the incompatibility.</p>

		<p>I was once asked step in on a project to migrate a networking process written in C++ from a 2000 box to 2008. The process would always stop exchanging networking traffic after a few minutes on the new box.  Investigations revealed that the original programmer seemed to take MSDN&#8217;s &#8220;don&#8217;t do this&#8221; warnings as a best practices guide, and it wasn&#8217;t clear how the networking code worked at all, except by pure dumb luck.  At least it was easy to fix.</p>

		<p>And the customer decided RECENTLY to move to Windows Server 2008 R2, which is also an older operating system?  There are newer server operating systems!  Server 2008 R2 has only about 3 more years of extended support; mainstream support has already ended. </p>

		<p>ShellExecute uses DDE when the application being launched says, &#8220;Please use DDE.&#8221; It will not use DDE if it isn&#8217;t explicitly requested. And you aren&#8217;t required to use DDE to interact with the shell. Your app can continue to pretend that DDE simply doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>

Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
