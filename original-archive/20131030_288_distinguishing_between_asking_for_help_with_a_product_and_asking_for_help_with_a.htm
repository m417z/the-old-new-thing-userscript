<p>Internally at Microsoft, we have a programmer's tool which I will call <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/16/9551818.aspx"> Program&nbsp;Q</a>. On the peer-to-peer mailing list for Program&nbsp;Q, somebody asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> What's the best way to look at all tables created in the past week? I want to repeat this command across multiple table repositories. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Somebody chimed in with the answer. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> You are looking for something like <code>q find table -age lt 7d</code>. If you want to repeat across multiple table repositories, you would say <code>q -server xxx find table -age lt 7d</code>, replacing <code>xxx</code> with the  table repository server name. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> This seemed to work, but there was a follow-up question: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> What's the best way to get the repository server name for any given repository? For example, what are all the repository servers used by my test team? Is there a central database I can query? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> To get the repository servers used by your test team, you um ask your test team? </p>
<p> The people on the <i>Program&nbsp;Q peer-to-peer help</i> mailing list do not know the names of your test team's repository servers. There is no central database of all Program&nbsp;Q servers. </p>
<p> It's like asking, "What's the best way to get the name of somebody's SharePoint site?" Answer: You ask them, "Hey, what's the name of your SharePoint site?" SharePoint itself does not maintain a central database of all SharePoint sites, but your test team might have a policy that all new SharePoint sites should be registered in some central database. You'll need to ask them. </p>

		<p>Not the same but kind of. I once wrote a feature to generate (rich) text reports in a personal finance planner application.</p>
<p>The financial institution &#8211; our clients &#8211; could customize the report, and put in different statements depending on certain financial conditions. We had special consultants to help the institution with this task.</p>
<p>After the feature was finished, I was repeatedly asked by the consultants to make reports and customizations. Often accompanied by questions about which statement would suit such and such condition.</p>
<p>I had an incredibly hard time explaining that I only implemented the feature, and that the content was up to them.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just that I was pegged as &quot;the report guy&quot;.</p>
<p>In the end they got it though. I could be quite persistent in refusing to do their job :)</p>

		<p>Sorry for the nitpicking, but for SharePoint you can register your SharePoint farm centrally in Active Directory with a service connection point (e.g. for SharePoint 2010 see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff730261(v=office.14).aspx">technet.microsoft.com/&#8230;/ff730261(v=office.14).aspx</a>). If you have permissions, you can query the service connection point and then query the farm for a list of sites. This isn&#39;t trivial but it is possible. Of course, this isn&#39;t on by default and by getting a list of sites, you still don&#39;t know the name of of that somebody&#39;s site (unless the name is &quot;Somebody&#39;s Site&quot;). The better approach is still to ask them.</p>

		<p>I agree with Jason. There are many servers which have administration tools that allow you to select a server from a list (SQL Server and Terminal Services come to mind). It&#39;s not too far-fetched to think that Program Q might have similar capabilities, or just register itself in AD.</p>
<p>I would certainly hope somebody would at least ask about it prior to manually compiling such a list.</p>
<p>To put it another way, let&#39;s say somebody asked &quot;What&#39;s the best way to find out Program Q&#39;s install directory on my server?&quot;. The answer might be &quot;Remember where you put it when you installed it&quot; or it might be &quot;Just check HKLMSoftwareMicrosoftProgramQInstallPath&quot;. Since the latter answer is just as likely as the former, you&#39;d be foolish for not asking.</p>

		<p>Eventually you have to know something though: &quot;Where is the repository of repositories? Where&#39;s that repository?&quot; (etc.) Also, if the program is an internal, limited-use app there likely isn&#39;t anything so fancy as a repository server!</p>

		<p>&gt; What&#39;s the best way to get the repository server name for any given repository</p>
<p>&gt; To get the repository servers used by your test team, you um ask your test team?</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible that the asker *has* a list of repositories (or at least, they know how to get it.) They are asking how to get the repository server name from the repository name, which is a reasonable question, assuming that the software is already successfully communicating with the repository.</p>

<p>A central license repository of the software does only have knowledge of where the installed software are located.

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
