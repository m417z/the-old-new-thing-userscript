<p> Whenever I post about a programming error that can lead to crashes, the security team gets all excited and starts looking for ways to exploit it. For example, when I wrote about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/02/14/372266.aspx"> the fundamentally flawed <code>DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES</code></a> flag, the security folks went scouring through the Windows source code looking for anybody who passed that flag, and then tried to come up with ways they could trick the code into loading an unintended DLL and causing trouble. </p>
<p> I wouldn't have known about this exercise at all if <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=19449"> one of the team members</a> hadn't forwarded me some email discussing their preliminary investigations as if to say, "See what you started?" </p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was highlighted in that thread or not, but DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES is the only way to inspect a DLL whose references may not be satisfied (so it&#8217;s useful for &quot;what does DLL do?&quot; tools, I have used it to inspect a mixed mode DLL through reflection).</p>

		<p>I used to read all the email automatically sent to the NT checkin email alias when developers checked in code to find any interesting bug patterns for my typo.pl perl script.</p>
<p>I depended on the checkin comment having sufficient information. Sadly most devs didn&#8217;t enter much interesting info.</p>
<p>Two that I remember were the change to EnterCriticalSection behaviour &#8211; the API contract changed so that it could throw an exception &#8211; and one from yourself, &quot;if (!x &amp; 1)&quot; is not the same as &quot;if (!(x &amp; 1))&quot;</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s also useful if you want to check through a directory for dlls implementing a certain set of procedures (e.g. plugins) but when you do not want to execute DllMain() of &#8216;random&#8217; dlls that aren&#8217;t the ones you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m sorry Raymond&#8230; but isn&#8217;t it sort of interesting, I suppose in a masochistic sort of way, to see how one little comment can evolve into a fire-storm of emails behind your back?</p>

<p>Some people can feel proud of what they do Dino, nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>One question: What do you contribute?</p>

		<p>I remember being on a security call where the customer wanted us to assure them that our desktop application could not reveal any information to a potential hacker. While we do make sure error dialogs, etc, reveal as little as possible, if they are on your *desktop* machine, then all they need is a little WinDBG and they can find all sorts of interesting information &#8211; especially for managed apps.</p>
<p>It was actually good &#8211; after I brought that up, they said, &quot;So I guess you can&#8217;t protect us from misconfiguration, viruses or trojan horses either, huh&quot; and we had a good chuckle. </p>

		<p>&quot;For example, when I wrote about the fundamentally flawed DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES flag, the security folks went scouring through the Windows source code looking for anybody who passed that flag, and then tried to come up with ways they could trick the code into loading an unintended DLL and causing trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>That despite the fact that if the code was tricked into loading an unintended DLL, DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES means that it is actually going to cause *less* trouble, because the DllMain is not executed, while without this flag, if the code was tricked into loading an unintended DLL, the DllMain code in the DLL will execute and can cause trouble.</p>

		<p>@Yuhong</p>
<p>As explained in the earlier post, even if the code loaded a common trusted dll (in fact especially if it did) with this flag, it would be setting a ticking time bomb for the next piece of code that loaded that dll and tried to call a function from it.</p>
<p>So really you&#8217;re not tricking it by telling it which library to load (although as you note, loading an arbitrary dll is dangerous enough), only tricking it to get it to load anything with the aforementioned flag.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
