<p>I dreamed that I was at a large trade show, where everybody had cleared the center of the main floor to make room for an impressive real-time holography demo.</p>
<p> After the demo was over, everybody moved their chairs back, but the German delegation had difficulty returning their chairs to the exact position they took them from, because everybody else (not being German) just put the chairs in rows without regard for their original row and seat number. </p>
<p> Next came dinner, and I had to help interpret for a German attendee (who in retrospect may have been Angela Merkel with dark hair) who had taken two appetizers and no main course (which was allowed, but it meant that she didn't get a main course). I got stuck translating the word "dessert" but I guessed. </p>
<p> When I woke up, I looked up the word, and it turns out that dream-me had guessed correctly. So I can speak German better in my dreams than in real life. </p>

		<p>+1 for Nachspeise (it feels bit more colloquial; Dessert and Nachtisch are more formal)</p>

		<p>Just my 2 cents on the fact that I, too, find that &quot;Nachtisch&quot; is slightly more colloquial than &quot;Nachspeise&quot; (I am for the south, btw). But I often find myself using the word &quot;Dessert&quot; instead.</p>

		<p>While everyone keeps concentrating on the dessert, I am wondering where Raymond got these German nightmares from. Thinking about it, it must be a relict of the time when was attempting to learn the language.</p>

<p>So did you yell &quot;No main course for you!&quot; (in German) at the Chancellor? (especially if the main course consisted of soup)</p>

		<p>I find a good way to decide, in similar circumstances, is to look up which word gets used in compound words &#8211; which die Deutschen just love. &nbsp;Following this rule, &quot;dessert&quot; wines by a mile. &nbsp;There is no &quot;Nachspeisewein&quot; or Nachtischwein&quot;; no &quot;Nachspeiselöffel&quot; or Nachtischlöffel&quot;, the usage is &quot;Dessertwein&quot;, and &quot;Dessertlöffel&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Smit-Tay: Another one of those things that you really never realize as a native speaker ;)</p>
<p>Btw I&#39;d consider Nachtisch more colloquial than Nachspeise or Dessert.. from the south too (well Austria, but bairische Dialekt is shared between Bavaria and several parts of Austria, so that&#39;s fine).</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve never been to Germany, but I heard that the urinals in mens&#39; toilets in at least one area come in three sizes, to accommodate different heights. I have this picture of half time at some german stadium during a big sporting event with a bunch of tall guys busting to take a piss and queuing to use the urinals, with all the toilets, and small and medium urinals free.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s amazing how in dreams you have characters that essentially create their own dialogue, as if you were visiting another world rather than just imagining it. I can&#39;t wait to get to the point where they tell me money-making ideas.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
