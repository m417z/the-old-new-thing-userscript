<p> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/125684"> Knowledge Base article 125684</a> gives the history behind these styles. Back in the 16-bit days, these styles really did give you black, gray, and white, or at least they did if you used the default color scheme. Windows&nbsp;95 shifted from using the window colors to the 3D colors, presumably to give the system a less harsh look. </p>

		<p>@Trevel: &nbsp;No, it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The linked article explains what colors the SS_XXX color styles map to, but you cannot use those colors in place of the SS_XXX style flags themselves. &nbsp;There are no alternative SS_XXX styles defined along the lines of SS_3DHILIGHTRECT, SS_3DSHADOWRECT and SS_3DDKSHADOWRECT, for example.</p>
<p>(Or if there are, the linked article does not identify them)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this is very relevant, but it is slightly. &nbsp;What colorful pattern do most property dialog boxes on XP have? &nbsp;What I mean is if you flood-fill the screen-shot of My Computer -&gt; Properties dialog box in mspaint in the grey central area, is does not work. &nbsp;The reason is clearer if you tilt laptop screen, or zoom in 8 times, or the best way is to auto-level adjust the same screenshot in paint.net.</p>

		<p>@Dean Harding, about theme API. Yes and no. You should use the theme API when themes are present, but if the OS runs in classic mode the theme API doesn&#8217;t work. Unless you want to force your users to run Aero (or Basic), you should support the old-style look as well.</p>

		<p>Well, for any new development you should be using the theme API, so it&#8217;s kind of moot now anyway.</p>
<p>Besides, while they&#8217;re not *actually* white, grey and black, they&#8217;re (usually) white-ish, grey-ish and black-ish. So it&#8217;s not like the colours are totally off.</p>

		<p>Safe mode also requires old apis. And will continue to require it for the foreseeable future in coming windows versions.</p>

		<p>Of course, in Windows 95&#8217;s default color scheme, the &#8216;black&#8217; was still black, the &#8216;white&#8217; was still white, and the &#8216;gray&#8217; was (darker than before) gray.</p>

		<p>They have been replaced with something else. &nbsp;Would probably be a good time to &#8216;deprecate&#8217; the names. &nbsp;Use a pragma or just remove them from the SDK and doc it.</p>
<p>&#8216;But that would require changing lots of code&#8217;. &nbsp;Yes but you are recompiling it anyway. &nbsp;You are at least somewhat close to the code. &nbsp;With pragma you just get a warning. &nbsp;With removing it would not compile.</p>
<p>Leaving leftovers in the code lead to bugs. &nbsp;With an SDK as old as the windows one I would bet there are hundreds of instances of this sort of thing. &nbsp;It is also not without precedence where a bunch of the old CRT calls were &#8216;deprecated&#8217;.</p>

		<p>&quot;Would probably be a good time to &#8216;deprecate&#8217; the names. &quot;</p>
<p>Yep, unlike function names like OpenIcon and CloseWindow that are set in stone, constant names are just names of #defines, which can easily change without changing the actual value which is the one actually used in the binaries.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
