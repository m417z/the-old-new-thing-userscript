<p>
Last time, we investigated one approach to the problem of
keeping a trackbar position on multiples of five:
Just divide everything by five!
(And then multiply by five when you read the value.)
This works great, except that accessibility tools report
the range as 0&ndash;20 in one-unit increments,
even though you are presenting it to the user as a range of
0&ndash;100 in five-unit increments.
</p>
<p>
So it's back to the drawing board.
This time, we'll leave the range at 0&ndash;100
and manipulate the trackbar position in the
<code>TRBN_</code><code>THUMB&shy;POS&shy;CHANGING</code>
notification.
</p>
<p>
Take
our program from last time
and make the following changes:
</p>
<pre>
<font COLOR="blue">#pragma comment(linker, \
    "\"/manifestdependency:type='win32' \
    name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' \
    version='6.0.0.0' \
    processorArchitecture='*' \
    publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' \
    language='*'\"")</font>
</pre>
<p>
This <code>#pragma</code> is
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070531-00/?p=26623">
a quick way to enable version 6 of the common controls</a>.
</p>
<pre>
BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
 g_hwndChild = CreateWindow(TRACKBAR_CLASS, TEXT(""),
    WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE <font COLOR="blue">| TBS_NOTIFYBEFOREMOVE</font>,
   0, 0, 100, 100,
    hwnd, (HMENU)100, g_hinst, 0);

  <font COLOR="blue">SendMessage(g_hwndChild, TBM_SETLINESIZE, 0, 5);
  SendMessage(g_hwndChild, TBM_SETPAGESIZE, 0, 20);</font>

  return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>
The
<code>TBS_</code><code>NOTIFY&shy;BEFORE&shy;MOVE</code>
style enables the
<code>TRBN_</code><code>THUMB&shy;POS&shy;CHANGING</code>
notification, which we will take advantage of below.
We leave the range at its default of 0&ndash;100 and set
the line size and page size to the desired multiples of five.
</p>
<pre>
<font COLOR="blue">LRESULT OnNotify(HWND hwnd, int idCtl, NMHDR* pnm)
{
 if (pnm-&gt;hwndFrom == g_hwndChild &amp;&amp;
     pnm-&gt;code == TRBN_THUMBPOSCHANGING) {
  auto ptpc = (NMTRBTHUMBPOSCHANGING*)pnm;
  auto pos = ptpc-&gt;dwPos;
  auto newpos = (pos + 2) / 5 * 5;
  if (pos != newpos) {
    SendMessage(pnm-&gt;hwndFrom, TBM_SETPOS, TRUE, newpos);
    return TRUE; // we moved the thumb, so the control doesn't have to
  }
 }
 return 0;
}
    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_NOTIFY, OnNotify);</font>
</pre>
<p>
When we are being notified that the thumb is about to move,
we take the proposed new position and round it to the nearest
multiple of five.
If that produces a value different from what the control would
have done, then we manually set the thumb position to the desired
multiple of five and return <code>TRUE</code>
to tell the trackbar that it shouldn't
move the trackbar thumb (because we moved it).
</p>
<p>
(And again, don't forget that if this is happening in a dialog box,
you need to use <code>DWLP_</code><code>MSG&shy;RESULT</code>
to make the dialog box return a nonzero value from its window
procedure.)</p>

		<p>This use of a return value in TRBN_THUMBPOSCHANGING is undocumented!</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/controls/trbn-thumbposchanging" rel="nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/controls/trbn-thumbposchanging</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The return value is ignored.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, some UI controls allow notification data to be modified directly instead of requiring a separate message be sent.  Does TRBN_THUMBPOSCHANGING allow the NMTRBTHUMBPOSCHANGING::dwPos field to be modified be the receiver?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
