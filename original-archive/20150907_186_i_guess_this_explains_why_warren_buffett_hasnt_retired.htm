Microsoft provides to its employees a
retirement calculator
that is more detailed than
<a href="http://money.msn.com/retirement/retirement-calculator.aspx">
the kinds you can find on the Internet</a>.
After gathering all sorts of information,
including your savings and spending patterns,
it draws some nice bar charts and tells you how
many years you should continue working before you
can retire.</p>
<p>
Even if I tell the calculator that I have
a billion dollars in savings,
it still tells me,
"You should work one more year."
</p>
<p>
<b>Clarifying note</b>:
I don't actually have a billion dollars in savings.

		<p>So, we&#39;ve established that Raymond doesn&#39;t have a billion dollars in savings. Next, we have to work out if he has *more* or *less* than that exact amount&#8230;</p>

		<p>Well, technically, if you only have $999,999,999.99, then you don&#39;t have a billion. On the other hand, these are my two cents, and if Raymond (as the owner of the blog) takes them&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#39;m really curious what kind of bug would produce such output. &nbsp;Assuming a simplified model where you know exactly when you die and your expenses each year are fixed and your income is fixed before retirement and zero afterwards, something like this formula should work:</p>
<p>years_left_to_work = (years_left_to_live * expenses_per_year &#8211; total_savings) / income_per_year</p>
<p>If you put in a large total savings in this formula, it should give a negative number: you should have retired decades ago! &nbsp;This number is crazy simplified, but surely _something_ like this is in that calculator? &nbsp;I can&#39;t imagine what sorts of calculation should give 1 year in the limit of infinite cash. &nbsp;Maybe it&#39;s getting very small numbers like 0.001 years, and then rounding up to the next year? &nbsp;But why should it be getting positive numbers at all?</p>
<p>I also wonder if anyone&#39;s retirement has been delayed for a year or two because of this bug. &nbsp;(In theory, it would delay it forever, but after 5 years most people would say &quot;you said 1 more year 1 year ago!&quot;)</p>
<p>Is the calculator developed in-house? &nbsp;I&#39;m guessing not, because this seems like the thing someone would have fixed by now if it were.</p>

		<p>I guess that&#39;s one way to keep employees around. I can actually see that being a factor of vesting cycles/pensions too.. say if you do have a billion dollars and you&#39;re enjoying what you&#39;re doing.. and you&#39;ve worked for 14 years.. and on 15th year you&#39;re getting vested to get even more money. Then, eh, why not keep saving more and not spend the billions? Then again, I&#39;m not in the tres commas club and probably would absolutely not think like that. </p>

		<p>A clever ploy by Microsoft HR to keep you working there.</p>
<p>You clearly need to find someone who got a bad score on their last performance review and see if the calculator tells them to retire immediately.</p>

		<p>I tried my current bank&#39;s automated advisor system a few years ago; feeding in a six figure value for current savings resulted in it trying to sell me a loan. It&#39;s almost as if they stood to make lots of money if I took one&#8230;</p>
<p>In the Microsoft one&#39;s case, presumably stock options vesting could be a factor &#8211; even with a huge amount in savings, why quit now and lose that money rather than stick around a bit longer to collect it?</p>

		<p>Just to let everyone know, Microsoft hasn&#39;t had an employee stock option plan for a *long* time (and any options that were outstanding have expired). &nbsp;As far as I know, there&#39;s never been a pension plan.</p>

		<p>If you have a billion dollars saved in the bank, I think you probably have realized that you&#39;re not there for the money (or at least I hope so.) That&#39;s not a bad thing; if you like working, why retire?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
