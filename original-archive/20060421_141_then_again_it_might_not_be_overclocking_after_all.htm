<p>While it's true that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/12/407562.aspx"> there's an awful lot of overclocking out there</a>, it's also true that not everything that looks like overclocking actually is.</p>
<p> Last Thanksgiving, I helped one of my relatives upgrade their computer by scavenging parts from another unused computer (installing more memory and replacing a broken CD drive). When I took the front panel off the machine, I was greeted with a wall of dust. A little wrangling with a vacuum cleaner was called for before I got around to yanking the broken CD drive and installing the replacement. </p>
<p> When we go through the failure reports that people submit, we find a lot of single-bit errors, where the correct value and the actual value differ in only one bit position. If these problems are systematic, then that would be the sign of some sort of software problem, but the ones we saw were one-time events, isolated single-bit errors. We had no proof, but we suspected flakey memory, possibly the result of an overheated machine. </p>
<p> People often stick their computers in out-of-the-way locations, against walls, on a carpeted floor, in a closet. While that's very convenient for home decor, the computer itself suffers because the flow of air through the computer has been impaired. The accumulation of dust impedes the cooling effect further. So make sure the vents on your computer are clean and unobstructed, or you too may find yourself on the short end of a memory glitch caused by overheating. </p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jeremyk/"> Jeremy Kelly</a> from the Exchange Server team was part of the team that investigated a crash that looked just like overclocking, except it wasn't. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jeremyk/archive/2004/07/19/187696.aspx"> The program crashed on a <nobr><code>mov eax, 0x20</code></nobr> instruction</a>, an instruction that merely loads a constant into a register. It doesn't access memory; it's not a privileged instruction; there's no reason why the instruction could fail. Yet it did. </p>
<p> This looked like overclocking, but the problem was consistently reproducible (atypical of overclocking), and besides, companies that pay tens of thousands of dollars for an Exchange server system aren't going to skimp on a few hundred by overclocking it. The Exchange server team were fortunate enough to be able to capture a live debug session, which permitted them to investigate the problem both on the user-mode side and on the kernel-mode side, and that revealed the true cause: The Exchange server had been infected with a rootkit. </p>
<p> The rootkit was lying to the user-mode debugger about what code was executing. It told the debugger that the instruction was the harmless one, when in fact the rootkit was doing something else. Looking at the problem from the kernel-mode side allowed our investigators to identify the true cause of the problem: A crashing bug in the rootkit itself. </p>

		<p>Well till last year December I did not even know what a rootkit was. Granted all operating systems are first-class rootkits it is quite amazing (and terrifying under some circumstances &#8211; in my case both) what one can do with virtualization, rootkits and the likes. It was indeed &#8211; in my few encounters with the borg, difficult to distinguish between hardware issues, dodgy software, operator issues, etc, etc. I would have to say its more about estimating the contribution of each in disaster situations. I have never had a failed hard disk in my life before &#8211; and I used to carry around desktop pc&#8217;s on flights. December I lost 4 of them. I have analyzed and subsequently decided that the one SATA was definitely my fault and the other was likely also caused by &quot;User Apprehension&quot;. The third is a mystery and the fourth one, well that was not me. I am down to 2 drives now and looking forward to space greater than 40GBs in the near future!</p>

		<p>Since rootkits are becoming more popular, and not just with hackers, I have started using Mark Russinovich&#8217;s RootKitRevealer as one of my standard debugging tasks when trying to diagnose a problem with my friends&#8217; computers.</p>

<p>I will have to definately start watching for root kits on machines&#8230; Spyware and Malware are all too common, and getting users to scan for it is difficult at best. &nbsp;It&#8217;s only a matter of time before they start installing them&#8230;</p>

		<p>Cosmic rays can indeed be a problem. &nbsp;It&#8217;s part of the reason that ECC memory was developed.</p>
<p>Radiations becomes a really big concern if you make systems for the upper atmosphere or outer space. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t find the origional page, but i read there was once upon a time a class on programming in C, and one of the students wrote this:</p>
<p>x = 7;<br />
<br />x = 7;</p>
<p>When the teacher asked &quot;Why would you do this?&quot; The student replied &quot;Just to be sure&quot;.</p>

		<p>this is an unbelievably scary post. &nbsp;one presumes that the exchange server as a production machine had various operational precautions re: what was loaded etc. onto it, as opposed to a user&#8217;s desktop &#8211; and yet a rootkit got there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>are there any details as to what rootkit it was and how it got on that machine? &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Sometimes failure doesn&#8217;t come from overclocking, not from dust and not from a rootkit.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve experienced very erratic behaviour from WindowBlinds. I tried to fight it (generically, not specifically), but i quickly saw it would give too much bloat and it just wasn&#8217;t worth all the trouble. I&#8217;ll dismiss any bugreports showing windowblinds dlls.</p>

		<p>WRT dust, I have a dust filter built into the front of my PC&#8217;s case, and then I just taped bits of 3M&#8217;s &quot;Filtrete&quot; furnace filter over the remaining vents of the case. &nbsp;I clean the first and swap out the others regularly and I&#8217;ve noticed that the inside of my PC is a lot less dusty than my previous PCs.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been reading here and there and I can&#8217;t understand </p>
<p>Will the new Windows Vista somehow stop Rootkits from spreading?<br />
<br />For example by dissalowing manipulation of FindFirst or EnumRegistryKeys or something<br />
<br />more sophisticated?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
