		<p>Actually When I told my 4 year old son that we could not go to the Bob The Builder site because my internet connection was broken he responded by getting his BTB toolkit and said &quot;are we gonna repair the internet?&quot;</p>

		<p>Of course, the real problem is that the &quot;internet&quot; name came from a network-centric environment at a time when ordinary users were most familiar with the desktop application model. &nbsp;The Internet should&#8217;ve been promoted as &quot;The Access&quot;, or &quot;The Connection&quot; in order to maintain backwards compatibility with the desktop view. :)</p>

		<p>This all seems funny to you guys, but I actually have a newly hired colleague here who seems determined to print the entire Internet. I thought it was bad when I found she prints every single email she receives, but she has now printed several *banner ads* as well.</p>
<p>In a similar vein:</p>

		<p>teh win: &quot;My mom used to (maybe still does) refer to closing Internet Explorer as &#8216;turning off the internet.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>My all-time favorite is still, &quot;My Microsoft crashed.&quot; I have people call me and give that as their error report.</p>
<p>Me: &quot;Okay&#8230; so did Windows crash, or did Explorer die&#8230; I mean Windows Explorer, not Internet Explorer&#8230; Or were you using Word, or Outlook?&quot;</p>
<p>Them: &quot;No, my Microsoft crashed. It&#8217;s not running anymore.&quot;</p>

		<p>An acquaintance of mine broke the internet by accident once, back in the very early 1990s.</p>
<p>Short version of the story: &nbsp;He put up a world-writable NFS fileshare on his box. &nbsp;A certain corner of Usenet found out about it while he was away for the weekend&#8230;. &nbsp;Apparently, before he got back, the resulting traffic had overloaded one of the major east-west backbones.<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
