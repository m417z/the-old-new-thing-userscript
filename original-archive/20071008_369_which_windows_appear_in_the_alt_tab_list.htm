Commenter Phil Quirk
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#416509">
wants to know what the rules are for determining which windows
appear in the Alt+Tab list</a>.
It's actually pretty simple although hardly anything you'd be able to guess
on your own.
<b>Note</b>: The details of this algorithm are an implementation detail.
It can change at any time, so don't rely on it.
In fact, it already changed with Flip and Flip3D;
I'm just talking about the Classic Alt+Tab window here.
</p>
<p>
For each visible window,
walk up its owner chain until you find the root owner.
Then walk back down the visible last active popup chain until you find
a visible window.
If you're back to where you're started, then put the window in the
Alt+Tab list.
In pseudo-code:
</p>
<pre>
BOOL IsAltTabWindow(HWND hwnd)
{
 // Start at the root owner
 HWND hwndWalk = GetAncestor(hwnd, GA_ROOTOWNER);

 // See if we are the last active visible popup
 HWND hwndTry;
 while ((hwndTry = GetLastActivePopup(hwndWalk)) != hwndTry) {
  if (IsWindowVisible(hwndTry)) break;
  hwndWalk = hwndTry;
 }
 return hwndWalk == hwnd;
}
</pre>
<p>
The purpose of this algorithm is to assign the most meaningful
representative winow from each cluster of windows
related by ownership.
(Notice that the algorithm doesn't care whether the owned window is
modal or non-modal.)
</p>
<p>
At least that's the simple rule if you're not playing crazy window
style games.
The <code>WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW</code> and <code>WS_EX_APPWINDOW</code>
extended styles were created so people can play games and put their
window in the Alt+Tab list or take it out even if the simple rule
would normally have decided otherwise.
This is one of those
"Okay, if you think you're smarter than Windows, here's your chance
to prove it" options.
Personally, I would avoid them since it makes your window behave
differently from the rest of the windows in the system.
</p>
<p>
A window with the
<code>WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW</code> extended style is treated as if it
weren't visible, even if it is.
A window with the
<code>WS_EX_APPWINDOW</code> extended style is treated as if it
has no owner, even if it does.
</p>
<p>
Once you start adding these extended styles, you enter the world
of "I'm trying to work around the rules" and the result is typically
even worse confusion than what you had without them.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure what the original commenter is getting at.
The window hierarchy described in the suggestion
(which doesn't make it so much a suggestion as it is a request
for me to debug their problem) says that window&nbsp;C is
modal on both windows A&nbsp;and&nbsp;B, which doesn't make
sense to me, since a window has only one owner.
</p>
<p>
The algorithm for choosing the Alt+Tab representative from each
cluster of windows may not be the best, but it's what we have.
I wouldn't be surprised if the details are tweaked from time to time.
No, wait, let me rephrase that.
I <i>know</i> that the details are tweaked from time to time.
The spirit of the operation is preserved
(to show the windows the user can switch to, using the most "natural"
candidate for each cluster of windows),
but the specific details may be fined-tuned as the concept of "naturalness"
is refined.</p>

		<p>I particularly hated the Windows 95 Alt+Tab list which skipped dialogs with invisible parents. It seems to basically use the same list that the task bar did.</p>
<p>Tyberius, Windows 3.x used to have an undocumented export named GetNextQueueWindow which provided this functionality. (My problem was trying to work out which window will activate after the current window is minimised, which skips minimised windows, then looks for topmost windows, but if there are no other windows then I give up&#8230; desktop perhaps?)</p>

		<p>2Marvin: the order in the sequence is the Z-order. Same as for tabbing through controls in a dialog box.</p>

		<p>I am wondering, what do you need the while loop for? If GetLastActivePopup returns the *last* active popup, will you get anything different if you call it again? In particular, the second GetLastActivePopup call is applied to an owned window, and the documentation states that you won&#8217;t get anything new, which is also confirmed by my testing. (Another question came up while testing: Why does GetAncestor(hwnd, GA_ROOTOWNER) return hwnd instead of the owner for owned windows without the WS_POPUP style?)</p>

		<p>What is the *order* of Windows in Alt-Tab sequence? I constantly hit situations where some windows are moved far away in the sequence without any apparent (to me) reason. Usually I have 3 actively used windows: <font color="red">Program A</font>, <font color="red">Program B</font> and a browser. There also might be a lot of other rarely used windows open. When I try to switch between <font color="red">Program A</font>, <font color="red">Program B</font> and/or browser quite often one of them will appear far in the queue instead of being close to others. I think it might have something to do with minimizing a window but I am not positive.</p>

		<p>A few days ago I had a strange bug&#8230; suddenly, the task list and alt+tab seemed to show *all* windows, even windows which are not supposed to be visible in the task list or alt+tab. I had to reboot to fix the problem. (Vista + SP1 beta)</p>

		<p>Yes, AFAIK, the Alt+Tab order is the same as the Z-order, which makes sense, because that way you can quickly reach the last two or three tasks, which are the ones you mos probably need, if you are working with a group of applications (IMHO, one of the most common scenarios for Alt+Tab use).</p>
<p>But I, being myself a hard Alt+Tab user, have found an annoyance that sometimes drives me nuts, and that may be what Marvin refers to. Most times, when you minimize a window (I&#8217;m also used to do that with Alt+Space, M), it goes to the bottom of the ZOrder. But sometimes (about one out of five times), it just goes back the second active window, and gets activated by the next &quot;blind&quot; Alt+Tab. I haven&#8217;t been able to find any rule for this. I use the same applications all time (mostly Windows Explorer, Firefox, Thundebird, and Visual Basic 6), and this can happen with any app.</p>
<p>Also, there is another annoying behavior I can&#8217;t understand. Visual Studio 6&#8217;s version of MSDN, when opened from the VB IDE, behaves as if it were a child of VB&#8217;s main window, but also get shown in the Alt+Tab list, and guess what? It also makes strange things with the switch order. It seems to happen too with topmost windows, which stay at the start of the list, no matter what you do, but at least this time it has some sense&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve had a few instances (although I forget which apps have triggered it) where I minimise an application, and then Alt-Tab completely misbehaves &#8211; for example, say I have apps A, B and C: say I&#8217;m on A and hit alt-tab once takes me to B in the chain, hit alt-tab again, and it takes me to C, then another Alt-Tab takes me back to A and it the cycle continues. Worth adding that when Alt-Tab starts doing this, focus and auto-raise stop working. I&#8217;ve sometimes been able to fix it by minimising all running apps with Win-D, Alt-Tab&#8217;ing the cycle one, clicking on one window on taskbar to bring it up and everything rights itself&#8230; but this doesn&#8217;t always work.</p>
<p>Odd.</p>

		<p>To sucky proggy: I wasn&#8217;t complaining about a determinate program bug, but trying to explain a couple of scenarios in which many programs are involved. I don&#8217;t believe we have to blame any of those programs. On the other hand, the algorithm that determines the Z-order of minimized windows or out-of-process child windows seems to act weirdly sometimes. That&#8217;s what I wanted to expose. And IMHO that is completely on-topic, because it&#8217;s directly related to the way Alt+Tab works.</p>

		<p>Raymond, you have mis-read the original commentor:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, if you have window A owns window B owns window C, they are all visible, and C is modal to the rest, then suddenly all three disappear from the ALT+TAB.&quot;</p>
<p>A owns B owns C, C is modal. C only has one owner.</p>

		<p>Thanks to everybody who confirmed I am not insane.</p>
<p>With regards to the Z-order this is nuts. Can you look at somebody&#8217;s monitor and determine what the Z-order of his windows is? The user expectation, I think, is that Alt-Tab would favor MRU windows and not rely on some invisible and hard to determine order. It shouldn&#8217;t matter how I switched from application A to application B: through a mouse click, minimizing A, Alt-Tab or anything else. When I click Alt-Tab I want to see A as the nearest choice.</p>
<p>Am I unreasonable?</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
