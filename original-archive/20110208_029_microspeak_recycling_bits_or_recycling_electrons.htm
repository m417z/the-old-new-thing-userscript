<p>To <i>recycle bits</i> (or <i>recycle electrons</i>) is to take an old piece of email and use it to answer a similar (often identical) question or discussion on a mailing list. This is usually done by simply replying to the thread with the two-word message "Recycling bits" (or "Recycling electrons") and attaching the original email message.</p>
<p> An important aspect of the use of this term is that the attached email message definitively answers the question or resolves the discussion. Usually, the attached email message comes from the very same mailing list that is hosting the current discussion. For example, consider this question: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  <b>From</b>: X<br> <b>To</b>: Q Discussion<br> <b>Subject</b>: How do I do X?<br> <b>Date</b>: February 8, 2011<br> </p>
<p> Blah blah blah blah? Blah blah. Thanks. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> An example reply which earns maximum style points would go something like this: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  <b>From</b>: Y<br> <b>To</b>: Q Discussion<br> <b>Subject</b>: RE: How do I do X?<br> <b>Date</b>: February 8, 2011<br> </p>
<p> Recycling electrons. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> &lt;Attached message&gt; </p>
<p> <b>From</b>: S<br> <b>To</b>: Q Discussion<br> <b>Subject</b>: RE: How do I do X?<br> <b>Date</b>: October 31, 2010<br> </p>
<p> You first need to frob the blurble and then blah blah blah blah. </p>
<p> ----Original message---- </p>
<p> <b>From</b>: R<br> <b>To</b>: Q Discussion<br> <b>Subject</b>: How do I do X?<br> <b>Date</b>: October 30, 2010<br> </p>
<p> Blah blah blah blah? Blah blah. Thanks. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> Since the question asked on February&nbsp;8 is identical to the question asked on October&nbsp;30, the answer from <i>S</i> can be re-used verbatim. (This of course assumes that nothing has happened in between to invalidate <i>S</i>'s original answer.) </p>

		<p>For this situation, I&#39;ll more prefer to use &quot;OP&quot;(Old posts).</p>
<p>The special requirement for use of &quot;OP&quot; (in certain BBS) is the answer to question exist within 3 pages in thread topic view. Implies the origional poster does not do basic homework of quick-searching within the forum/discussion group he/she is going to post first. The board masters may issue warning to the origional poster if this is explicitly written as a no-no in board rules.</p>

		<p>But how many electrons do you use to search through your mailbox archives in order to find this oooold answer?</p>
<p>Probably much more than you want to recycle ;-)</p>

		<p>@Hardt: None, unless you own a particle accellerator. Otherwise electrons get recycled and reused. It&#39;s hard to use up an electron&#8230; &amp;grin*</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
