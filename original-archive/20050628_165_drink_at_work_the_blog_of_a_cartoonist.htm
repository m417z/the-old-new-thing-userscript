<p> Francesco ("Ces") Marciuliano is the author of the comic strip <a href="http://www.kingfeatures.com/features/comics/sforth/about.htm"> Sally Forth</a>. In his blog, <a href="http://www.drinkatwork.com/blog.html"> Drink at Work</a> he expounds on whatever tickles his fancy. (Warning: Includes strong language, adult situations, and political views.) Sure, <a href="http://www.drinkatwork.com/2005_04_01_archive.html#111358765927960249"> the stories on writing a cartoon are fun</a>, especially when he <a href="http://www.drinkatwork.com/2005/05/concerns-for-kitty-questions-for-me.html"> responds to feedback from readers</a>, and he also has a long series of articles titled Comic Strip Writing 101 (example: <a href="http://www.drinkatwork.com/2005/04/comic-strip-writing-101-its-not-all.html"> Comic Strip Writing 101: It's Not All Pabst and Vicodin</a>), but that's not the best part. No, the best part is the conversations with his father. Here's an except from <a href="http://www.drinkatwork.com/2005/04/conversations-with-dad-2.html"> Conversation number two</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> <strong>Dad:</strong> Marciulianos live much longer than average folks! Look at your Grandpa! He would still be alive today if he hadn't died in that hospital. </p>
<p> <strong>Ces:</strong> What? </p>
<p> <strong>Dad:</strong> Y'know, from that spill he took...when he had to go to the hospital. I bet if he didn't fall he would still be around today. </p>
<p> <strong>Ces:</strong> At age 102? </p>
<p> <strong>Dad:</strong> See? That's what I'm talking about. Marciulianos live a long time. </p>

		<p>I really can&#8217;t wait until all the Art Buchwalds of the world die off (this guy is that type).  It&#8217;s weird, but just reading their writing makes me think I smell that stuffy, dungeony, old people odor.  And frankly I need to see hard evidence before I believe that anyone reads Sally Forth.  Rest their eyes on it before having a stroke, maybe, but actually read it?  Nuh-uh.</p>

<p>I got the URL wrong, too.  Try this instead: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.comicscurmudgeon.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.comicscurmudgeon.com</a></p>

		<p>So, is there a cartoon of Joe Peterson being unceremoniously fired for Longhorn&#8217;s lead-time then?</p>

		<p>That was interesting.  I was trying to work out just how somebody capable of being so funny in his blog could be so, well, not as funny in his cartoon.  Then I read this entry: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.drinkatwork.com/2005/04/serious-suggestion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drinkatwork.com/2005/04/serious-suggestion.html</a></p>
<p>Ah, it&#8217;s a backwards compatibility problem&#8230;</p>

		<p>Brian, while I&#8217;ll defend to the death your right to say whatever you want, I must respectfully ask that you stop wishing for the death of my husband.  Oh, and stop comparing him to Art Buchwald.  I would never, EVER consider blowing Art Buchwald.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
