<p>On BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/theoneshow/"> <i>The One Show</i></a>, presenter Michael Mosley <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071013140455/http://www.bbc.co.uk/theoneshow/article/2007/09/mm_luck.shtml"> tests a theory</a> of <a href="http://www.richardwiseman.com/"> Professor Richard Wiseman</a> that part of being lucky is simply being more aware of incidental information in your surroundings, information seemingly unrelated to the task at hand but which may ultimately help you achieve your goal.</p>
<p> (Professor Wiseman has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/quirkology"> many interesting videos on YouTube</a>. I particularly like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voAntzB7EwE"> the colour-changing card trick</a>. (Spoiler: <span style="background: white; color: white"> I noticed only one of the changes myself. What I found fascinating was that he made no effort to hide the sound of the backdrop changing, because he knew nobody would notice.</span>) </p>
<p> We've seen manifestations of this phenomenon earlier, such as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/10/661389.aspx"> learning about what is ordinary so you can recognize things that are out of the ordinary</a>, or people who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/01/6909020.aspx"> ignore the answer that's right in front of them even after it's pointed out to them</a>. </p>

		<p>Ironically in the colour-changing card trick, the card itself was the only thing whose colour didn&#8217;t actually change.</p>
<p>I watched the video in the office with the sound off so I guess I didn&#8217;t get the full effect.</p>

		<p>Jeez &#8211; that color-changing card trick video sure made me feel like a fool&#8230; &nbsp;I blame it on &nbsp;having watched it right after getting up (no coffee yet&#8230;). &nbsp;</p>
<p>This reminds me of an old online card trick:</p>

		<p>The best part of the online card trick is that the easiest way to figure it out is to not follow directions.</p>

<p>&quot;[Try turning the monitor around so the bright side faces you. -Raymond]&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what we call a mega-burn. &nbsp;I wasn&#8217;t planning on observing it, but I just might have to borrow it! &nbsp;Lucky!</p>

		<p>I read an article in Discover about &quot;lucky&quot; people. They did a set up at a coffee shop and invited (at different times) two people, one considered &quot;lucky&quot; and the other &quot;unlucky.&quot;</p>
<p>The lucky person spotted the 5 dollar bill on the ground in the doorway, while the unlucky person missed it.</p>
<p>The lucky person sat down next to the well dressed businessman and started up a conversation (hence expanding his network of people and potential &quot;I know some who can help&quot;) While the &quot;unlucky&quot; patron sat by herself and didn&#8217;t speak to anyone.</p>

		<p>While the colour-changing card trick didn&#8217;t fully get me (I spend way too much of my free time doing art, thus large shifts in color attract my attention), this is also a very good example of how video can shape perception. &nbsp;If you pay attention you can see the changes, but since the camera is literally directing your attention for you, the actual act of changing is not captured at all. &nbsp;The same with Phill&#8217;s link; by purposely constraining the field of view, crowding it with activity, and desaturating the colors, you are forced into an information overload and can miss minor changes when given an observation task.</p>
<p>chrismcb, the article you read, if it was testing two people who considered themselves to be lucky or unlucky, would be more about self-fulfilling prophecy than anything else. &nbsp;People who think well of themselves are more proactive and likely to see opportunities than people who are too busy feeling self pity.</p>

<p>Women, OTOH, can remember the clothes i wore last week :-P</p>
<p>And i still don&#8217;t know how the card trick is done.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
