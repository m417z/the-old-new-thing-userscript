<b>Update</b>:
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/11/07/10464408.aspx#10464658">Daniel points out</a>
that there is still a race condition here, so this trick won't work. Rats.
</p>
<p>
The documentation for the
<code>Set&shy;Threadpool&shy;Callback&shy;Library</code>
says
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
This prevents a deadlock from occurring when one thread in
DllMain is waiting for the callback to end,
and another thread that is executing the callback
attempts to acquire the loader lock.
</p>
<p>
If the DLL containing the callback might be unloaded,
the cleanup code in DllMain must cancel outstanding
callbacks before releasing the object.
</p>
<p>
Managing callbacks created with a
<code>TP_<wbr>CALLBACK_<wbr>ENVIRON</code>
that specifies a callback library is somewhat processor-intensive.
You should consider other options for ensuring that the library
is not unloaded while callbacks are executing,
or to guarantee that callbacks which may be executing
do not acquire the loader lock.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I'm not going to help you with the DllMain cleanup issues.
(My plan is to simply avoid the issue by preventing the DLL
from unloading while a callback is still pending.
That way, you never have to cancel the callback from DllMain.)
But I am going to help with the
"consider other options for ensuring that the library is not
unloaded while callbacks are executing."
</p>
<p>
The first-pass solution is to use the same trick we use
when creating worker threads:
We 
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/11/05/10463645.aspx">
bump the DLL reference count when queueing the work item</a>
and use
<code>Free&shy;Library&shy;When&shy;Callback&shy;Returns</code>
to decrement the reference count after the callback finishes.
(We can't use
<code>Free&shy;Library&shy;And&shy;Exit&shy;Thread</code>,
of course, since we're running on a thread on loan to us
from the thread pool.
Exiting the thread from a thread pool callback is like
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/04/30/10004931.aspx">
demolishing the house you're renting</a>.)
</p>
<p>
The second-pass solution is to
manage the DLL reference count manually.
(Don't go down this route unless your profiling suggests that
DLL reference count management is a performance bottleneck.)
The rule is still that the DLL reference count is prevented
from dropping to zero while a callback is pending,
but instead of incrementing the reference count each time
we scheduled a callback,
we'll increment it only when the number of callbacks goes
from zero to nonzero.
Conversely, we decrement the reference count only when the
number of callbacks drops from nonzero to zero.
</p>
<p>
You can think of this as proxying the reference count,
similar to how COM creates proxies that collapse
<code>Add&shy;Ref</code> and <code>Release</code>
calls and signal the remote object only when the reference
count transitions from zero to nonzero or vice versa.
</p>
<p>
This optimization works for
<code>Free&shy;Library&shy;And&shy;Exit&shy;Thread</code>,
too,
so let's fold that in while we're there.
</p>
<pre>
LONG g_lProxyRefCount = 0;

BOOL ProxyAddRefThisDll()
{
 if (InterlockedIncrement(&amp;g_lProxyRefCount) == 1) {
  HMODULE hmod;
  return GetModuleHandleEx(GET_MODULE_HANDLE_EX_FLAG_FROM_ADDRESS,
                           reinterpret_cast&lt;LPCTSTR&gt;(g_hinstSelf),
                           &amp;hmod);
 }
 return TRUE;
}

DECLSPEC_NORETURN
void ProxyFreeLibraryAndExitThread(DWORD dwExitCode)
{
 if (InterlockedDecrement(&amp;g_lProxyRefCount) == 0) {
  FreeLibraryAndExitThread(g_hinstSelf, dwExitCode);
 } else {
  ExitThread(dwExitCode);
 }
}

void ProxyFreeLibraryWhenCallbackReturns(PTP_CALLBACK_INSTANCE pci)
{
 if (InterlockedDecrement(&amp;g_lProxyRefCount) == 0) {
  FreeLibraryWhenCallbackReturns(pci, g_hinstSelf);
 }
}

		<p>What if you need to have a thread (or other thread-related constructs) in a DLL which is managed only by LoadLibrary/FreeLibrary, and doesn&#39;t have a dedicated export to shut it down outside of a loader lock? For example, you need to add a thread into a DLL used by applications, and you cannot change the calling appication?</p>
<p>The solution is to have the first (legacy interface) DLL load a secondary DLL which would actually contain the code executed by threads. On the first DLL&#39;s DETACH_PROCESS (unload), it should call a function in a secondary DLL to signal the shutdown of threads (only signal, not wait!). The threads in the second DLL would also wait for all thread pool callbacks, and other asynchronous rundown. Then the threads would exit by FreeLibraryAndExitThread. Bingo! Both DLLs are now unloaded.</p>

		<p>The code for ProxyFreeLibraryAndExitThread actually contains a serious race condition:</p>
<p>If the two last threads call it at the same time, its possible that:</p>
<p>1. thread A first calls InterlockedExchange (receives 1), so goes to the ExitThread branch.</p>
<p>2. before it goes any further thread B gets active goes to InterlockedExchange, receives 0 and calls</p>
<p>FreeLibraryAndExitThread</p>
<p>3. Thread A now would like to continue, but it&#39;s code has been dropped in the meantime&#8230;</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t have too much experience with thread pools, but when I had a task I needed to run 2500 times, in parallel, but obviously only a handful at once, just assigning a thread pool to handle them all was like delicious MAGIC. &nbsp;It worked very nicely.</p>
<p>(Specifically, the task was sending a network packet to a game server to query the game information and waiting for the response, then parsing it, then invoking the UI thread to update with the game information in a server list.)</p>

		<p>There is a far, far simpler solution that works for many use cases (many, but not all):</p>
<p>During initialization, increase the reference count on your DLL. Never decrease it. You are guaranteed to never get unloaded until the process terminates. If this is OK for your situation, then all other bookkeeping is moot.</p>

		<p>Re the C10K problem: &nbsp;I used to work for an airline. &nbsp;In the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, airline reservations systems had 80,000 terminals connected at once, and could handle 5,000 transactions per second. &nbsp;Now, all of those travel agents are likely using PCs instead of directly-connected terminals. &nbsp;I don&#39;t work for an airline anymore, so I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s PCs are likely more powerful than mainframes of that era, and they certainly have more memory. &nbsp;I do know that the TPF operating system is a fascinating thing. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Joshua: In my experience, select() is obsolete. In fact, the C10k problem exists partially due to the poor scalability of select() &#8212; the same list of 500 sockets has to be traversed by the kernel for every single call. If you are stuck using a select-based framework, use WSAAsyncSelect which has no limit on sockets (it&#39;s more like Linux&#39;s epoll than select). However, the proper way to do it is to use a completion port (and implicitly a thread pool).</p>

		<p>About &quot;use one thread per connection is obsolete&quot;: Better &quot;use the right tool for the job&quot;.</p>
<p>If any client interaction is dominated by waiting, not by frantic processing, and you really have to serve many connections, one thread/process per connection is too heavyweight.</p>
<p>If there are only ever a handful connections or you must do heavy processing for each client, the resource overhead is negligible while the conceptual overhead for keeping things asynchronous might be telling.</p>
<p>One size does not fit all.</p>

		<p>@Joker_vD:</p>
<p>I would disagree with the reference counting needs to be done with the thing referencing it too.</p>
<p>For the COM reference counting, I normally go along the lines of one reference = one variable. This is along similar lines, one reference = one thread.</p>
<p>While it is still possible to do slips, like a double Release on a single pointer, or missing a Release resulting in an outstanding reference. I have noticed that the most problems I have had from reference counting is from the server side, and even that is rare and easy to fix.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: select() caps out at 64 sockets by default, but according to the docs, you can actually #define FD_SETSIZE to whatever value you want before #include&#39;ing &lt;Winsock2.h&gt; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms739169%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/ms739169%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>That said, as others have said, select() doesn&#39;t scale well to large numbers of sockets due to the need to iterate through the entire FD_SET. &nbsp;A callback-oriented API like WSAAsyncSelect() or epoll() scales much better. &nbsp;Particularly on Linux, where select() is O(largest FD) but epoll() is O(number of FDs).</p>

		<p>Joker_vD: I don&#39;t think someone who doesn&#39;t understand why thinking in terms of interfaces or what problem reference counting solves is in any position to criticise OLE/COM.</p>

		<p>@Joker_vD:</p>
<p>The writer of &quot;OLE rant&quot; doesn&#39;t get OLE at all. Here is a hint: object ownership/lifetime tracking is VERY difficult problem. He thinks that instead of reference counting you should just delete the object when you&#39;re done with it: &quot; there is very little need for refcounting as long as you agree not to destroy the object while you are using its interfaces&quot;. But knowing when you&#39;re done with using its interfaces is the hardest part. And that&#39;s what the reference counting makes extremely easy.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
