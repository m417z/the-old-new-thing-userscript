<p>
If you decide to display some modal UI, it is important that
you set the correct owner for that UI.  If you fail to heed
this rule, you will find yourself chasing some very strange bugs.
</p>
<p>
Let's return to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
our scratch program</a> and intentionally introduce a bug
related to incorrect owner windows, so that we can see the
consequences.
</p>
<pre>
void OnChar(HWND hwnd, TCHAR ch, int cRepeat)
{
  switch (ch) {
  case ' ':
    // Wrong!
    <i>MessageBox(NULL, TEXT("Message"), TEXT("Title"), MB_OK);</i>
    if (!IsWindow(hwnd)) MessageBeep(-1);
    break;
  }
}

// Add to WndProc
    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_CHAR, OnChar);
</pre>
<p>
Run this program, press the space bar, and instead of dismissing
the message box, click the "X" button in the corner of the main
window.  Notice that you get a beep before the program exits.
</p>
<p>
What happened?
</p>
<p>
The beep is coming from our call to
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/debug/base/messagebeep.asp">
the <code>MessageBeep</code> function</a>,
which in turn is telling us that our window handle is no longer valid.
In a real program which kept its state in per-window instance variables
(instead of in globals like we do),
you would more likely crash
because all the instance variables would have gone away when the
window was destroyed.  In this case, the window was destroyed while
inside a nested modal loop.  As a result, when control returned to
the caller, it is now a method running inside an object that has been
destroyed.  Any access to an instance variable is going to access
memory that was already freed, resulting in memory corruption or an
outright crash.
</p>
<p>
Here's an explanation in a call stack diagram:
</p>
<pre>
 WinMain
  DispatchMessage(hwnd, WM_CHAR)
   OnChar
    MessageBox(NULL)
     ... modal dialog loop ...
     DispatchMessage(hwnd, WM_CLOSE)
      DestroyWindow(hwnd)
       WndProc(WM_DESTROY)
        ... clean up the window ...
</pre>
<p>
When you clean up the window, you typically destroy all the
data structures associated with the window.  But notice that
you are freeing data structures <strong>that are still being used</strong>
by the <code>OnChar</code> handler deeper in the stack.
Eventually, control unwinds back to the <code>OnChar</code>,
which is now running with an invalid instance pointer.
(If you believe in C++ objects, you would find that its "this"
pointer has gone invalid.)
</p>
<p>
This was caused by
<a HREF="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32/msg/850b8e9e80c4cbae">
failing to set the correct owner for the
modal <code>MessageBox</code> call</a>, allowing the user to
interact with the frame window at a time when the frame window
isn't expecting to have its state changed.
</p>
<p>
Even more problematic, the user can switch back to the frame
window and hit the space bar again.  The result: Another
message box.  Repeat another time and you end up with a stack that
looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
 WinMain
  DispatchMessage(hwnd, WM_CHAR)
   OnChar
    MessageBox(NULL)
     ... modal dialog loop ...
     DispatchMessage(hwnd, WM_CHAR)
       OnChar
	MessageBox(NULL)
	 ... modal dialog loop ...
	 DispatchMessage(hwnd, WM_CHAR)
	   OnChar
	    MessageBox(NULL)
	     ... modal dialog loop ...
</pre>
<p>
There are now four top-level windows, all active.  If the user
dismisses them in any order other than the reverse order in
which they were created, you're going to have a problem on your
hands.  For example, if the user dismisses the second message box
first, the part of the stack corresponding to that nesting level
will end up returning to a destroyed window when the third message
box is finally dismissed.
</p>
<p>
The fix is simple, and we'll pick up there next time.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a problem I had a while back, and that I&#8217;ve seen in many other programs. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s related, though.</p>
<p>Most applications which show icons in the little recessed area of the taskbar with the clock in it will produce a popup menu if the user right-clicks the icon. In several applications, including the only one I&#8217;ve ever wrote which had this kind of interface, the user could only dismiss the menu by selecting an item from it or by clicking on the main application window.</p>
<p>My guess as to why this was had to do with the window having the wrong parent HWND, so the messages about loss of focus and so on were going to the wrong place. However, I never did get around to finding a solution because the project was terminated not long afterward.</p>
<p>So my question is this: what is the correct way to launch a popup menu from a notification icon? Should its parent be the taskbar window?</p>
<p>As I say, mine is not the only application I&#8217;ve seen which had this problem. I even saw MSN Messenger do it once, although I was unable to recreate it later so perhaps that was just caused by strange circumstances.</p>

		<p>Ben: I&#8217;ve had that problem too with my applications. The way I &quot;solved&quot; it was by having a &quot;&lt;no action&gt;&quot; menu item which people could click to get the thing to go away, which was not a very good solution. I&#8217;m not sure what I was doing wrong either, but I think I had the parent window set correctly.</p>

		<p>This is the solution. There is a knowledge base entry to this issue.</p>
<p>SetForegroundWindow(hWnd);<br />
<br />TrackPopupMenu(..);<br />
<br />PostMessage(hWnd, WM_NULL, 0, 0);</p>

		<p>Regarding the reason for TrackPopupMenu() problems: Sounds like you&#8217;re hitting a restriction in how windows can capture input.  AFAIK, only the foreground window can capture mouse input, so if you&#8217;re app isn&#8217;t then you&#8217;ll lose all those clicks outside of the menu.</p>

<p>Astute observation.  See the discussion on 64 bit Windows for another example.</p>
<p>Actually, pretty much every person I&#8217;ve met from Microsoft has this attitude.</p>
<p>Maybe this is the reason why the problems with Windows APIs are not documented worth a darn in MSDN.  Before using any, always search Google, you&#8217;ll find the shortcomings (See the recent discussion on MsgWaitForMultipleObjects).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
