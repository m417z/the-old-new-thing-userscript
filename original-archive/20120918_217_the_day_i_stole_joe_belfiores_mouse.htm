<p>He's now the head demo-monkey/cheerleader for Windows Phone, but back in the old days, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/joeb/"> Joe Belfiore</a> was the head demo-monkey/cheerleader for the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface design. A team-wide meeting was held to show off the new interface that they had developed. Wow look, we have a Start menu (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/22/54559.aspx">though it wasn't known by that name yet</a>), a taskbar (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/10/54831.aspx">though it wasn't known by that name yet</a>), shortcuts, a Close button (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/05/22/10308528.aspx">in the upper right corner</a>), property sheets, all that good stuff.</p>
<p> At that time, I was still developing my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/tags/The+social+skills+of+a+thermonuclear+device/"> thermonuclear skills</a> and in particular was cultivating the skill of asking challenging questions during the Q&amp;A that comes at the end of these sorts of meetings. I adopted the role of the mouse skeptic and asked, "I noticed that property sheets don't show up in the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> list. How do I switch to a property sheet without a mouse? And more generally, how well will this new interface work for keyboard-based users?" </p>
<p> The answer (which managed to remain true all the way through the Windows&nbsp;95 project) was "To get back to a property sheet, go back to wherever you launched it from and launch it again. And we have not abandoned the existing rules for keyboard access. There will be keyboard equivalents for all mouse-based actions." </p>
<p> To make sure he stuck to his word, I snuck into his office and stole his mouse. </p>
<p> I assume he survived, though for all I know, he just went and ordered a new one. </p>

<p>Well, certainly without the mobile equivalent, the stylus. Finally. Just a shame that MS Internet Explorer&#39;d Windows Mobile &#8211; &quot;Job&#39;s done lads, time to quit development. Surely nobody will ever catch up with us.&quot;</p>

		<p>I was so annoyed that my control panel dialogs didn&#39;t appear in the Alt+Tab sequence that I went and wrote a replacement RunDLL32.exe; I did run into a number of gotchas but I basically got it working well enough for the infrequent use that I put it to.</p>

		<p>@Ray: No, Windows Mobile was scrapped because it was so far behind. The all-or-nothing security model (i.e. apps had to be signed by an approved certificate, for most consumer phones, but once running could do anything), the stylus-driven controls, the legacy Win32 GDI drawing model, the open multitasking model (where background apps still run and drain the battery), were just completely uncompetitive with the iPhone. On top of that you still had (and have!) the 32MB-per-process limit from Windows CE 1.0; fixed in Windows CE 6.0 but the Windows Mobile team seriously dragged their heels on porting to CE 6.0.</p>
<p>Technically it was moved from the consumer products division to the Windows Embedded division, where it is in maintenance: it has been renamed Windows Embedded Handheld. You can still buy Windows Embedded Handheld devices, if you&#39;re willing to buy rugged devices from Motorola Solutions, Intermec, Casio, Honeywell, Psion Teklogix, Denso ADC, etc. I&#39;m still writing .NET Compact Framework applications for Windows Mobile/Windows Embedded Handheld, or for OEM custom Windows CE platforms (excuse me, &#39;Windows Embedded Compact&#39;). We&#39;re starting to see customers wanting Bring-Your-Own-Device or just to make use of far cheaper Android devices or (within reach of wireless LAN) iPod Touch, and there are Android devices coming soon from those OEMs, such as the Motorola Solutions MC40.</p>
<p>MS have of course faced exactly the same issue with Windows 8 tablets. This time they&#39;ve gone with fusing a new interface &#8211; both user and programming &#8211; together with the old. There is of course a far larger marketplace of existing Windows applications out there!</p>
<p>Back to the topic &#8211; there&#39;s something of the opposite in Microsoft Management Console, where the property sheets of virtually any snap-in don&#39;t appear in the taskbar, they aren&#39;t owned by the console frame window (so don&#39;t pop back up when you click the taskbar button for the console) and you can only get back to them by Alt+Tab or by moving windows out of the way!</p>

		<p>I always found it a weird choice that property sheets didn&#39;t show up in some places such as the taskbar. They also don&#39;t get minimized by Win+M, so that&#39;s the easiest way to reach them, even if you have a mouse. I think MS finally fixed this in Vista or Win7.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
