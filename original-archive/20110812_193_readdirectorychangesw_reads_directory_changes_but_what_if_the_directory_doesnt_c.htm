<p>The <code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code> function reads changes to a directory. But not all changes that happen to files in a directory result in changes to the directory.</p>
<p> Now, it so happens that nearly all changes to a file in a directory really do result in something happening to the file's directory entry. If you write to a file, the last-write time in the directory entry changes. If you rename a file, the name in the directory entry changes. If you create a file, a new directory entry is created. </p>
<p> But there are some changes that do not affect the directory entry. I've heard rumors that if you write to a file via a memory-mapped view, that will not update the last-write time in the directory entry. (I don't know if it's true, but if it's not, then just pick some other file-modifying operation that doesn't affect the directory entry, like modifying the contents of a file through a hard link in another directory, or explicitly suppressing file timestamp changes by calling <code>Set&shy;File&shy;Time</code> with a timestamp of <code>0xFFFFFFFF`<wbr>FFFFFFFF</wbr></code>.) The point is that since these changes have no effect on the directory, they are not recognized by <code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code>. The <code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code> function tells you about changes to the directory; if something happens that doesn't change the directory, then <code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code> will just shrug its shoulders and say, "Hey, not my job." </p>
<p> If you need to track all changes, even those which do not result in changes to the directory, you need to look at other techniques like the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/aa363798.aspx"> change journal</a> (a.k.a. USN journal). </p>
<p> The intended purpose of the <code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code> function is to assist programs like Windows Explorer which display the contents of a directory. If something happens that results in a change to the directory listing, then it is reported by <code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code>. In other words, <code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code> tells you when the result of a <code>Find&shy;First&shy;File</code>/<wbr><code>Find&shy;Next&shy;File</code> loop changes. The intended usage pattern is doing a <code>Find&shy;First&shy;File</code>/<wbr><code>Find&shy;Next&shy;File</code> to collect all the directory entries, and then using the results from <code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code> to update that collection incrementally. </wbr></wbr></p>
<p> In other words, <code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code> allows you to optimize a directory-viewing tool so it doesn't have to do full enumerations all the time. </p>
<p> This design philosophy also explains why, if too many changes have taken place in the directory between calls to <code>Read&shy;Directory&shy;ChangesW</code>, the function will fail with an error called <code>ERROR_<wbr>NOTIFY_<wbr>ENUM_<wbr>DIR</wbr></wbr></wbr></code>. It's telling you, "Whoa, like so much happened that I couldn't keep track of it all, so you'll just have to go back and do another <code>Find&shy;First&shy;File</code>/<wbr><code>Find&shy;Next&shy;File</code> loop." </wbr></p>

		<p>@Joshua</p>
<p>Documentation says: &quot;The operating system detects a change to the last write-time only when the file is written to the disk&quot;, which imho is not the same as CloseFile.</p>
<p>Gosh, I wish there was at least &quot;on file close notification&quot;</p>

		<p>&quot;I&#39;ve heard rumors that if you write to a file via a memory-mapped view, that will not update the last-write time in the directory entry.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve certainly seen cases in which file data is updated but file metadata is not.</p>
<p>I have a home-grown backup system that uses volume snapshots and robocopy to copy the system volume to an external drive, then computes the sha256 checksum of the source &amp; destination files to verify. There are always a handful of files that fail the verification step. FWIW, the Explorer&#39;s thumbcache_*.* files seem to frequently trigger this. Manual inspection of the files shows their data has indeed changed, while their metadata has not.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#39;s possible (but unlikely) that Explorer is updating these files then explicitly resetting the metadata.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if this is related to memory-mapped access, or if it&#39;s a side-effect of volume snapshot access, or maybe both.</p>

		<p>So is .NET FileSystemMonitor functions built on this? I had impression that on Windows OSs the event is guaranteed to be fired.</p>
<p>On a related note, the Mono implementation on .NET v1.1 is depending on certain kernel extension named inotify that&#39;s known to discard event on rapid event firing. The difference caused me pain debuging unexpected bugs at that time.</p>

		<p>cheong: Yes, the .NET FileSystemWatcher class uses ReadDirectoryChangesW under the covers.</p>

		<p>This comes into play when trying to use an explorer window to watch a large file copy (when something other than explorer initiated the copy). It is necessary to press F5 periodically to determine the file size.</p>
<p>Note that the CopyFile API advance reserves the disk space so things copied that way cannot be observed at all.</p>

		<p>I tried adding ERROR_NOTIFY_ENUM_DIR to the MSDN documentation but the server seems to be b0rked today, at least when it comes to accepting Community Content.</p>
<p>Will try again later.</p>
<p>Something to add to the discussion (which I&#39;ll also put in the MSDN comment):</p>
<p>Remember to (re-)start watching the directory for changes before your first FindFirstFile/FindNextFile loop, otherwise you will miss changes that occur during the loop or between the end of the loop and the time you start monitoring for changes.</p>

		<p>After three days trying to add a comment about ERROR_NOTIFY_ENUM_DIR to the MSDN page and (after lengthy delays at all stages) getting CGI errors, I give up.</p>
<p>@Dave, maybe you can try doing it. Or maybe Microsoft can update their own documentation.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
