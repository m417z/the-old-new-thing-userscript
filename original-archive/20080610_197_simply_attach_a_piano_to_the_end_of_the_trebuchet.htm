		<p>There was actually an episode of Northern Exposure where Chris Stevens flings a piano.</p>

		<p>Yes, but you know that 90% of pianos are setup unattended &#8211; how does a trebuchet help with that?</p>

		<p>I am a bit worried about the robot with the flaming bowling balls in the desert scrub. &nbsp;Geekiness severly outweighed common sense for that one. &nbsp;Hurling flame amongst tinder-dry foliage? &nbsp;Should be arrested for even attempting it!</p>
<p>(Speaking as a Australian who has seen the effects of major fires with very small beginnings.)</p>

		<p>Can&#8217;t you just blit the piano from one location to the next? (avoiding damage in the process!)</p>

		<p>@SteveD: &lt;paraphrase&gt;idiots!&lt;/paraphrase&gt;</p>
<p>Aw man&#8230; that&#8217;s why we have a bushfire dept, I presume California has similar (okay, I&#8217;m kidding, too. The house across the road from my parents house burnt down back in the bushfire of 2003 AND my ex-girlfriend&#8217;s parents house *did* burn down&#8230; <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://images.google.com.au/images?q=canberra+bushfire" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com.au/images?q=canberra+bushfire</a>).</p>
<p>I wanna a robot with a shiny metal trebuchet. Or a crossbow. That&#8217;d be cool. And a non-flammable playpen.</p>
<p>(BTW if anyone&#8217;s seen Smash Lab&#8230; don&#8217;t. An hour watching YouTube a week is better use of your time)</p>

		<p>Yeah, but what *sound* did it make? &nbsp;Whenever I see flying pianos, I imagine Warner Brothers cartoons where pianos fall and make a very unmelodious noise when they hit a hapless coyote or cat. &nbsp;I know the WB sound effects recordist just banged all the keys hard in the cartoon&#8230;but what does it sound like for *real*?</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s no guarantee that there&#8217;s somebody sitting in front of the piano when it&#8217;s playing. It could be a unattended player piano.</p>
<p>The trebuchet is a zero carbon shipping method for minimizing global warming. But Igor will probably argue that the trebuchet does cost you some carbon credits since you&#8217;ll have to chop down some trees to constuct the trebuchet.</p>

		<p>@syntax: Count &#8217;em and weep.</p>
<p>@jondr: you&#8217;re a natural, really sharp, humour of note, a real clef-hanger, well orchestrated, tied together etc. There! That should stave off any quaverings for future puns; I should take a rest before y&#8217;all get crotchety&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
