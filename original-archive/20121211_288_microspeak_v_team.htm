<p>People who don't work at Microsoft but who are aware of its jargon might encounter the term <i>v-team</i> and guess that it's a team consisting of vendors, because the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/korbyp/archive/2003/09/18/54146.aspx"> Microspeak term <i>v-dash</i></a> is used to refer to vendors (whose email addresses begin with <i>v-</i>).</p>
<p> It's a good guess, but in this case, it's wrong. </p>
<p> Tasks at Microsoft typically map to organizational boundaries. (Organizational boundaries having been chosen so that tasks fall nicely within them.) A memory management feature will be handled by the memory management team. A user interface feature will be handled by the user interface team. But there are some tasks that span teams, and for those cases, Microsoft managers like to create a virtual team, usually abbreviated <i>v-team</i> and pronounced <i>vee team</i>. (Not to be confused with the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/virtualization/"> Virtualization Team</a>.) </p>
<p> The defining characteristic of a v-team is that the members of the v-team come from different parts of the organization. For example, you might have Alice from the Power Management team, Bob from the User Interface team, and Charlie from the Networking team working together to design cloud-based notifications. These people do not share the same immediate manager, but for the purpose of this feature, they've been plucked out of the tree and formed into a self-organizing team to solve a particular problem. </p>

<p> These virtual teams are formed as needed and conversely are disbanded when no longer needed. Some may be short-lived, like a virtual team to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/09/15/10211688.aspx"> review all the sample apps for the //build conference</a>, which disbands once review is complete. Others may last for the duration of the project, like a virtual team to debug performance issues. </p>

		<p>When the deliverable of such a team is a feature, who owns maintenance of it once the team disbands? &nbsp;In every place I&#39;ve worked that uses temporary &quot;feature&quot; teams, the issue of who gets saddled with maintenance or phoned when the feature explodes is one that never seems to get addressed. &nbsp;Does the v-team reform to maintain the feature as needed, or does one of the teams that donated a member get tagged?</p>

		<p>@AC: It&#39;s whoever owns the feature. For example, if the feature is an improvement to the shell, it would be the shell team.</p>
<p>Usually however the whole point of the v-teams is that their function isn&#39;t developing a new product or feature that needs to be maintained (otherwise you&#39;d stand up a &quot;real&quot; team to do it). They are used to build products or features that are &quot;one off&quot; (like the Browser Choice app &#8211; remember that?) or to &quot;improve&quot; features that will continue to be owned by the feature team. For example, security reviews and performance reviews will often be made up of v-teams. When they leave, the product continues to be owned by the developer team that made it.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>In the case of a v-team formed to develop a feature, the actual feature work belongs to the respective teams. (In the example I gave, the power management team would still be responsible for the power management aspects of cloud-based notifications, the user interface team would be responsible for the user interface part, and the networking team would be responsible for the networking part.) If the feature needs to be redesigned, then a new v-team is formed to redesign it. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@Dejan021 Agile development comes in many flavours but typically agile methodologies will advocate a fixed team (of cross disciplined or specialised individuals as appropriate) in order to better track velocity or flow over a period of time. The thought being that groups of individuals take time to effectively communicate, work together, correctly estimate their progress as well as implicit setup and teardown costs to short term teams.</p>
<p>That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a bad idea, but it&#39;s not something associated with typical agile development processes. Plus if a &#39;V-Team&#39; ran for a long term it could in itself follow such an agile methodology (but the fact it is virtual is irrelevant).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
