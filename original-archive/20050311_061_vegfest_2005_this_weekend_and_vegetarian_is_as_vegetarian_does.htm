		<p>Perhaps in the States. Once, upon telling an American that I was vegetarian, they commented &quot;But you still eat chicken, right?&quot;. </p>
<p>This is interesting because I have found that in other places (specifically, the UK and Australia) &#8216;vegetarian&#8217; really does mean that: no fish, no meat or seafood of any kind. I still ate fish when I first became a vegetarian (or more accurately, &#8216;piscatarian&#8217;), but stopped when it was pointed out to me that fish aren&#8217;t vegetables, which became my standard response to questions like &quot;But you still eat chicken, right?&quot;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how attitudes about this kind of thing vary from place to place :)</p>

<p>I get kind of tired of being ask that question (or Fish).  I am from the states and for one reason or another my wife and I slowly stopped eating meat a decade ago.  No particular reason just got tired of it and and went looking for other more interesting foods from around the world.  We were in an area several years ago where getting a meatless meal was a major effort so I tried a shrimp dish.  I was ill for a day.  Guess I can&#8217;t digset it anymore.</p>
<p>Also what bugs me is the first thing that people think is that you have to have a agenda for being vegetarian (PETA, etc.)  We have none.  Just don&#8217;t like the taste of it anymore.  There are too many other great dishes out there to sample!</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s sad that most people think that chicken and fish are vegetables. And many people can&#8217;t imagine what to eat when animals are excluded from the meal. Like this popular question: &quot;So, you don&#8217;t eat any meat&#8230; what do you eat then?&quot;</p>
<p>Seems like it is very trendy to say that you&#8217;re vegetarian these days, so a lot of people who eat white meat (eg. chicken) say that they&#8217;re vegetarians. Lot&#8217;s of these surveys ends up with an incorrect result.</p>

		<p>In Australia, as far as I&#8217;ve seen, &quot;vegetarian&quot; means you don&#8217;t eat animal products; this includes the sort of products that are frequently seen in some of the low-clue eateries under the heading of &quot;vegetarian option&quot;: bacon bits, chicken, anchovies, chicken stock, and so on.  Vegetarians don&#8217;t eat fish, chicken or pork, so it&#8217;s not just a &quot;I don&#8217;t like red meat&quot; kind of thing.  If you want to go one step further, you can be vegan: avoid cheese and eggs because they&#8217;re &quot;stolen&quot;, in a sense, from the animals that suffered to produce them.  Vegans will also avoid wearing leather, and possibly even wool (although you&#8217;ll find arguments either way, since sheep that don&#8217;t get shorn regularly end up feeling less comfortable than those that do).  Halfway between you&#8217;ll find vegetarians who will eat cheese only if the rennet (an obscure ingredient) wasn&#8217;t made from calf stomachs, and will avoid gelatine in sweets and desserts because it&#8217;s made from the hooves of cattle.  At the even more extreme end you&#8217;ll find fruitarians, people who hate the idea of even killing plants, and will therefore only eat plant products that don&#8217;t require death: fruit is OK, cos the tree lives on; carrots are not, because the carrot is the root of the plant, which then gets thrown away.</p>
<p>I also coined a term for people who avoid eating &quot;cute&quot; animals like sheep and cows, but don&#8217;t mind eating ugly ones like fish and lobster: I call them &quot;uglytarians&quot;.  They&#8217;re making the world a more beautiful place!</p>
<p>This is a hugely cultural and political issue.  You&#8217;ll find extremists everywhere, and there are more bitter feuds between individual vegans who do and don&#8217;t wear specifically <em>second hand</em> woollen clothes, say, than you&#8217;ll find between George W and Osama B.<br /></p>

		<p>I question the meaning of these results. Is it that people don&#8217;t know what vegetarianism is, or is it that surveys of this nature are terribly flawed because people will just make up answers without even reading the questions?</p>

<p>I am not really wanting to turn this into another discussion war, but I guess you have to admit to yourself that there is a certain error in this logic. You are complaining about people questioning your &quot;choice of food&quot;. But at the very same time you are questioning the choice of life of the living creatures which &quot;serve&quot;   for your Schnitzel.</p>
<p>Anyway, to reply to the other comments &#8230;. I always wonder how someone can consider a cow as meat but not a fish (or in my experience more seldom) chickens. Meat is Meat.</p>

		<p>Meat is meat except for dogs (in some countries), whales (in some countries), horses (in some countries), etc.  This doesn&#8217;t mean I favour torture of conscious animals or hunting any species to extinction, it just means I still think logically ^_^</p>
<p>In some parts of India the difference between a veg meal and a non-veg meal is that the non-veg meal includes an egg.  But yogurt seems to be pretty popular.</p>

<p>If you dont agree with me, then this is more or less fine. But dont try to come up with &quot;arguments&quot; which come not close at all.</p>
<p>When I take antibiotics I am defending myself against &quot;intruders&quot; who harm my own life. I doubt you can say an innocent Schnitzel-source (aka cow) is doing the same.

		<p>&quot;I just don&#8217;t want to eat an animal that&#8217;s standing here inviting me to,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;it&#8217;s heartless.&quot;</p>

<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>&quot;A green salad,&quot; said Arthur emphatically.</p>
<p>&quot;A green salad?&quot; said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly at Arthur.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you going to tell me,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;that I shouldn&#8217;t have green salad?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the animal, &quot;I know many vegetables that are very clear on that point. Which is why it was eventually decided to cut through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that actually wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly. And here I am.&quot;</p>

		<p>Maybe thats news for you but animals need food also.</p>
<p>So for each 1 pound of meat produced you need at least 12 pounds of grains (to feed the animal),  so you still causing more harm by eating animals than grains, the higher you go in the chain of food the more resources (water, food, etc&#8230;) are wasted, there is no magic.</p>

		<p>I remember watching a wildlife documentary about lions where a herd of african buffalo decided to attack the lions and their cubs. As I watched these huge muscular creatures trying to trample the lion cubs to death all I could think of was &quot;Mmmm. Buffalo steaks!&quot;</p>

		<p>Alexander Muller,</p>
<p>&gt;First of all, eating no meat does not harm &gt;anybody! This is a proven<br />
<br />&gt;fact, period. </p>
<p>That may be true for adults, but a recent study on the effect of a vegan diet on children prompted the leader of the study to claim that denying children meat in their diets was morally wrong because of the significant detrimental effect on their mental and physical development. The same is also true for breast feeding women.</p>

		<p>This may be stating the obvious for many, but the concept of fish not being considered meat should be fairly undestandable (especially right now). AFAIK, catholics are not supposed to eat meat during lent, but fish is safe. </p>
<p>My personal classification is that meat = muscle. I.e. liver != meat, it&#8217;s just liver. I do tend to judge food by taste exclusively, though, not by where it comes from or what had to die to produce it&#8230;.</p>

		<p>&gt; That may be true for adults, but a recent study on the effect of a<br />
<br />&gt; vegan diet on children prompted the leader of the study to claim<br />
<br />&gt; that denying children meat in their diets was morally wrong because<br />
<br />&gt; of the significant detrimental effect on their mental and physical<br />
<br />&gt; development. The same is also true for breast feeding women.</p>
<p>You know, there are lies, damn lies and statistics. I wouldnt really<br />
<br />call the USDA unbiased, least of all when they claim as one of their<br />
<br />missions to &quot;ensure profitability for farmers and processors&quot;.</p>
<p>Anyway, what it definitely cant be is &quot;being morally wrong or<br />
<br />unethical&quot;, because that is already &quot;murdering other creatures&quot;. What<br />
<br />it could be &#8211; for human children and feeding women &#8211; is that eating<br />
<br />small amounts of meat might actually give additionally required<br />
<br />nutrients, but even that I doubt very much as there are plenty of<br />
<br />counter studies which show that plain vegetarianism (I am not talking<br />
<br />about veganism) does not have any negative effects.</p>

<p>This is not about silly religious myths but about facts. The roman<br />
<br />catholic church also speaks about not having sex before being married<br />
<br />and so on.</p>
<p>&gt;<br />
<br />&gt; My personal classification is that meat = muscle. I.e. liver !=<br />
<br />&gt; meat, it&#8217;s just liver.</p>
<p>If that is your personal classification then it is fine for you. But a<br />
<br />fish is still a living and feeling creature and anybody eating fish is<br />
<br />no vegetarian.</p>

		<p>Just to toss something out on the debate&#8230; there is an alternate way of looking at the debate rather than the two ends.</p>
<p>Another option is to look at how the animal has been treated and whether or not it was given a chance to live, or simply viewed as a meat-wad.  So, consider this: eat meat (eggs, etc), but require it to be organic, free range, cage-free, no-GMO (not really applicable to meat yet, AFAIK), etc.</p>
<p>It costs a bit more, but is well worth it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to convince (real) vegetarians  they should eat meat or anything, just toss out an alternate way.</p>

		<p>Tito, of course this is a better way, but still not really acceptable, because the result is the same &#8230;. a murdered being</p>
<p>Raymond, unfortunately it is a common behaviour in today&#8217;s (and probably also yesterday&#8217;s) world that people say something but act completely different. This does not only happen with vegetarianism but also in politics, religion, daily life &#8230;. and even in the IT &#8211; just have a look how people criticise things at Microsoft and accept the very same things with other corporations or organsiations.</p>
<p>I think the actual problem is that ever since humans existed the majority didnt think independently but only followed the flow &#8211; or in newspeek &quot;Hype&quot;.</p>

		<p>What always amuses me is the fact that so many meat eaters seem to be closet vegetarians! Every time I&#8217;m at an event where there are vegetarian and non-vegeterian options, the veggie food is gone way before the more meaty stuff. I chuckle every time I see the &quot;sausage and pepperoni&quot; pie going to waste while all of the veggie pies are quickly devoured.</p>
<p>I actually suggested to one admin that they should order more veggie stuff to adjust for the imbalance, but she jumped to the conclusion that I was making a moral argument ;).</p>

		<p>I hate when people confuse me with a vegetarian just because I like eating veggies.  My favorite lunchtime meal these days is this veggie burrito listed on the menu as &quot;Vegetarian&quot;.  It&#8217;s great, but every time someone finds out that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m eating, they&#8217;re like &quot;Oh, you&#8217;re a vegetarian now?&quot;.  Kind of annoying.</p>

		<p>&quot;When I take antibiotics I am defending myself against &#8216;intruders&#8217; who harm my own life. I doubt you can say an innocent Schnitzel-source (aka cow) is doing the same.&quot;</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re saying one life is worth more than another ? You&#8217;re willing to kill millions of living beings to stop them from harming 1 life (yours). (just an observation, I totally agree with this)</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt you can say an innocent schnitzel-source (aka cow) is doing the same.&quot;</p>
<p>The cow is not harming me, but not eating the cow *does* harm me. In case you didn&#8217;t notice, humans are omnivorous, our entire digestive system is built for a mixed-diet, and we require certain nutrients we aren&#8217;t capable of producing ourselves.</p>
<p>And what about carnivorous animals ? shouldn&#8217;t they be able to eat ?</p>
<p>While one cow is killed to produce the nice juicy steak on my and a lot of other people&#8217;s plates. Dozens of animals die from farming equipment while growing and harvesting the same amount of &#8216;vegetarian&#8217; food.</p>
<p>Btw, if you your goal is to harm as little animals as possible, you should read this: <a target="_new" href="http://www.wildlifedamagecontrol.com/animalrights/leastharm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wildlifedamagecontrol.com/animalrights/leastharm.htm</a></p>

		<p>&gt; So you&#8217;re saying one life is worth more than another ?</p>
<p>No, meat eaters are saying that!</p>
<p>&gt; You&#8217;re willing to kill millions of living beings to stop them from<br />
<br />&gt; harming 1 life (yours).</p>
<p>This is something called self defence.</p>
<p>&gt; The cow is not harming me, but not eating the cow *does* harm me.</p>
<p>First of all, eating no meat does not harm anybody! This is a proven<br />
<br />fact, period.</p>
<p>Secondly, this is exactly the point where your &quot;argument&quot; collapses.<br />
<br />Jay complains about people questioning his &quot;choice of food&quot;, while he<br />
<br />is doing the same and questions the &quot;choice of life&quot; of other living<br />
<br />creatures. This stands in no relation to self defence and hence your<br />
<br />argument has simply no ground.</p>
<p>If someone has got a reason to question the existence of someone else,<br />
<br />then it is just as justified when someone only questions food habits.</p>

		<p>Okay people enough with the &quot;meat is murder&quot; arguing. My point with this article was the disconnect between people *saying* that they are vegetarian and actually *being* vegetarian. I&#8217;m making no value judgements about ethics.</p>

		<p>Gerrard: I see that too, especially with pizzas.  The veggie slices are usually the first to go.</p>
<p>The few times I&#8217;ve been able to convince people to order a [pepperoni/onion/pineapple] pizza, that one also disappeared almost before I had a slice, even though everyone claimed it sounded disgusting.  Sigh.</p>

		<p>I just returned from an East Coast (US) trip.  Finding a &quot;vegetarian&quot; meal was rather difficult in the smaller communities in central New York.</p>
<p>I went to a Mediterranean Restaurant that had a whole section of &quot;vegetarian&quot; dishes.  They all contained shrimp and fish except for the spinach pie. Don&#8217;t ask me why they did not call it what it was, Spanikopita, I don&#8217;t know.  I also did not quite get the definition of &quot;vegetarian&quot; either.</p>
<p>I have never seen this in the southwest US or southern California. </p>

<p>The administrative assistant where I work makes special orders for me when we have lunch at meetings.  I see the same thing with Pizza but not with Lasagna.  One place makes an absolutely amazing veggie Lasagna  but that one must just seem &quot;wrong&quot; to meat eaters.</p>

		<p>When it comes to vegitarian food, pasta is one of my favorite choice. Also if thinking of some pure vegitarian and delicious food try Indian restaurant.</p>

		<p>&amp;quot;In a survey of 11,000 individuals, 37% of those who responded &amp;quot;Yes, I am a vegetarian&amp;quot; also reported that in the previous 24 hours they had eaten red meat; 60% had eaten meat, poultry or seafood.&amp;quot; I&#8217;m so glad&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
