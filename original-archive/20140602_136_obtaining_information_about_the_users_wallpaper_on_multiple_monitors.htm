Today we're going to dump information about the user's wallpaper
settings on multiple monitors.
</p>
<p>
The idea is simple. You use the
<code>IDesktop&shy;Wallpaper</code> interface on the
<code>Desktop&shy;Wallpaper</code> object
to get information about the desktop wallpaper.
It will tell you the wallpaper positioning information,
whether a single image is being used for all monitors,
where those monitors are,
and which image is on which monitor.

 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
The program proceeds in a few basic steps.
</p>
<p>
We create the <code>Desktop&shy;Wallpaper</code> object.
That object will give us the answers to our questions.
</p>
<p>
Our first question is,
"Is the same wallpaper being shown on all monitors?"
To determine that, we call
<code>IDesktop&shy;Wallpaper::<wbr>Get&shy;Wallpaper</code>
and specify <code>nullptr</code> as the monitor ID.
The call succeeds with <code>S_OK</code> if the same wallpaper
is shown on all monitors (in which case the shared wallpaper
is returned).
It succeeds with <code>S_FALSE</code> if each monitor has a different
wallpaper.
</p>
<p>
To get information about the wallpaper on each monitor,
we iterate through them,
first asking for the monitor device path,
since that is how the
<code>Desktop&shy;Wallpaper</code> object identifies monitors.
For each monitor, we ask for its location
and the wallpaper for that monitor.
Note that if the monitor is not displaying a wallpaper at all,
the <code>Get&shy;Wallpaper</code> method succeeds
but returns an empty string.
</p>
<p>
And that's it.
You can juice up this program by asking for wallpaper
positioning information,
and if you are feeling really adventuresome,
you can use the <code>Set&shy;Wallpaper</code>
method to change the wallpaper.</p>

		<p>I would assume that if each monitor is set to display a part of a larger wallpaper then it would return S_OK to the call to IDesktopWallpaper::GetWallpaper with nullptr as the monitor ID?</p>

		<p>What happens if there are no monitors?</p>
<p>What happens if a monitor goes away during this loop? &nbsp; &nbsp;What happens if a monitor gets added during this operation? &nbsp; What happens if something horrible, like the Catalyst control center, is slowly munging with the installation?</p>

		<p>To take a stab in the dark, I bet Windows 8 wallpaper span mode internally works the same as wallpaper spanning utilities did on Win 7 and earlier &#8212; simply create a giant image the size of the desktop bounding rectangle then use the legacy Tile mode</p>

		<p>There is always no error checking in Raymond little programs. That&#39;s not the point of them.</p>
<p>Besides that looking at the MSDN documentation for GetMonitorDevicePathAt and GetWallpaper will answer some of your questions.</p>

		<p>What&#39;s great fun is when Remote Desktop tries and fails to turn your wallpaper off.</p>
<p>I think most annoying is those PCs that had OEM branding on the logon screen, as that wasn&#39;t affected by the remote wallpaper setting.</p>
<p>The other time I noticed was when remotely assisting someone with automatically changing wallpaper. Although remote assistance initially disabled the wallpaper, it was restored at the next automatic changeover interval. (Fortunately that was over a faster connection so it wasn&#39;t a problem.)</p>

		<p>The only downside to this new API is that it sometimes doesn&#39;t use the fade transition when applying the wallpaper change. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn&#39;t, which means (for us anyway) we can&#39;t use it or our users will complain.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
