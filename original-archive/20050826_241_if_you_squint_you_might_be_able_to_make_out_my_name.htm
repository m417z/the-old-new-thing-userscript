<p>Late Tuesday night, Jenny Lam, the creative director for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/"> this year's PDC</a>, came by our hallway and asked for permission to rummage through our offices for "stuff". They were looking for props to use to decorate a developer's cubicle in a video they were filming for the conference. I was able to loan her a framed letter of appreciation and my pass to the Windows&nbsp;2000 launch. I used to have a lot more junk in my office, but I went on a cleaning binge during our last office move and the really cool mementos ended up at my house. If you watch the movie and squint you might be able to make out my name on the personalized items, but I wouldn't hold my breath. My stuff will be on screen for probably a quarter of a second, and I'm guessing it won't be big enough to read anything of significance. (Jenny tells me that one of the things in the cubicle is a forgery. See if you can spot it.)</p>
<p> They were able to get much cooler stuff from my neighbor's office. Among other things, he had a chemical model of <a href="http://db.uwaterloo.ca/~alopez-o/Coffee/caffaq.html"> the caffeine molecule</a>. </p>
<p> Incidentally, Jenny puts my Martha number at two. I've met Jenny, and Jenny was personally interviewed by <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/"> Martha Stewart</a>. I just think that's so neat, being two steps away from The Martha. </p>

		<p>I still have my Windows 2000 Launch Pass as well.  I was one of two people there from Microsoft Product Support, and I remember not really being told what was going to happen&#8230;when they announced the &quot;Windows 2000 Development Team&quot; and turned the spotlight on the big group of uniformed MS employees, I looked around with a &quot;What?  Who?  Me?!&quot; look.</p>
<p>Probably the only time in my life I will be lumped into the same group as Raymond.  Oh well.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not just neat, it&#8217;s A Good Thing. After all, how many people who aren&#8217;t even &#8216;real&#8217; get to have a Martha number of two?</p>

		<p>Surprised you really want to be more closely associated to Martha. I guess you do like knitting so there&#8217;s some kind of bonus for you there.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
