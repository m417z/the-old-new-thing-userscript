		<p>I really don&#8217;t like the site. &nbsp;Unless I&#8217;m missing something, I can&#8217;t find anywhere to look up local organizations taking donations. &nbsp;After all I&#8217;m not going to mail my stuff to California.</p>

<p>Basically, you give stuff away to people who want or need it :) I&#8217;ve cleaned out quite a few cupboards of old computer parts this way, and you&#8217;d be surprised how many people actually want stuff (very few, but hey, any at all is surprising!).</p>

		<p>In Sunnyvale, CA, the Computer Recycling Center (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.crc.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.crc.org</a>) will take anything you have to donate, and will give you a receipt that can be used for tax deduction purposes!</p>

		<p>For somewhere around the last 4 years or so, computers sold to individuals have to include the recycling fee in the sales price. &nbsp;If you recycle a computer older than that, you have to pay the fee at the time of recycling.</p>
<p>And what happens if you just stick it in a bag for non-burnable garbage where you&#8217;ve only paid the fee to dispose of some volume of non-burnable garbage, I don&#8217;t know. &nbsp;I have occasionally seen stickers attached to bags of garbage where pickup was refused.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t figure out why the recycling mark is optional on computers sold to businesses. &nbsp;As far as I can tell, the omission of a recycling mark doesn&#8217;t reduce the price, but just causes the standard fee to become payable at the time of recycling.</p>
<p>Odds are that the fee doesn&#8217;t really accomplish much and recycling of unrecyclable components is accomplished by shipping it to India the same as was done 10 years ago.</p>

		<p>Kit too old? Oh, yes. I tried &quot;recycling&quot; a load of stuff on eBay, with 0.01 starting prices. I only lost about half of it.<br />
<br />Mind you, there was a lot of ISA cards in there&#8230;..</p>

		<p>What, nobody will want my old 16-colours-of-gray Zenith 286/12MHz laptop? &nbsp;It&#8217;s got a killer 40M hard drive, and 640K of RAM&#8230;</p>

		<p>I found an even better system. &nbsp;20 miles north of here there&#8217;s a computer recycling plant. &nbsp;People drop off their discarded items, the plant separates and melts down the materials and sells them (i.e. plastic, metal, glass). &nbsp;They have no security and alot of their stuff is just left outside. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a small two-cop town so anyone can basically drive in, load up the car, and leave. &nbsp;I got 4 21&quot; viewable CRTs that do 1920&#215;1200 in one night.</p>
<p>Rather amusing, really. I used to load up, go home and test it all, and return the stuff that didn&#8217;t work the next day when I came back for the next load.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
