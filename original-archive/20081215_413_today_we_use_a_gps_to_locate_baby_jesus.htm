<blockquote class="q"><p> For two consecutive years, thieves made off with the baby Jesus figurine in Wellington, a town of 60,000 in Palm Beach County, Fla. The ceramic original, donated by a local merchant, was made in Italy and worth about $1,800...  </p>
<p> Last year, officials took a GPS unit normally used to track the application of mosquito spray and implanted it in the latest replacement figurine. After that one disappeared, sheriff's deputies quickly tracked it down. </p>

<p> It's sad that the world has come to this, but nice to know that technology is helping to make the world a slightly better place. </p>

		<p>I guess some people just see it as a tradition to steel the Baby Jesus. Or at least trying to start one.</p>
<p>Just like it is tradition to burn down the giant straw goat in G&#228;vle, Sweden. Even though it is quite illegal to do so.</p>

<p>(incidentally there is an &quot;In popular culture&quot; section in that article)</p>

		<p>To be announced soon: &nbsp; The GPS will include a time machine so that they will actually be able to tell where baby jesus came from.</p>

		<p>This is a perfect example of results driven development. &nbsp;After their prayers went unanswered the first time, they went to a more proven and reliable technology. &nbsp;The next logical step is to attach lasers to His head. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this will lead to an arms race. &nbsp;Eventually Baby Jesus will have to be surrounded by land mines and machine guns, and the true meaning of Christmas will have been lost.</p>

		<p>Well, it&#8217;s what the GPS for. I can imagine that very soon, there will be an online program which a user can buy to track everything or people. Put the GPS on that thing or person and you can watch their movement online!!!</p>

		<p>Today, Gaspar, Melchior and Balthasar would not have to follow the bright star in order to find Bethlehem. They would have a TomTom GPS installed on their chameleons.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
