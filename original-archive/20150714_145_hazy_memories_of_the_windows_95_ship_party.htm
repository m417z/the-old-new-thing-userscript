<p>One of the moments from the Windows&nbsp;95 ship party (20 years ago today) was when one of the team members <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/13/10037412.aspx"> drove his motorcycle through the halls</a>, leaving burns in the carpet.</p>
<p> The funny part of that story (beyond the fact that it happened) is that nobody can agree on who it was! I seem to recall that it was Todd, but another of my colleagues remembers that it was Dave, and yet another remembers that it was Ed. We all remember the carpet burns, but we all blame it on different people. </p>
<p> As one of my colleagues noted, "I'm glad all of this happened before YouTube." </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.ignitionpartners.com/brad-silverberg/"> Brad Silverberg</a>, the vice president of the Personal Systems Division (as it was then known), recalled that "I had a lot of apologizing to do to Facilities [about all the shenanigans that took place that day], but it was worth it." </p>

		<p>I bet it was Todd. &nbsp;Some time ago, the company I was working for moved into a new building. &nbsp;Before they built out the warehouse, though, our Todd took his Corvette for a few laps inside. &nbsp;He left a few tire marks; I don&#39;t remember who was stuck with cleaning them up. &nbsp;Probably things had to be cleaned before the build out anyway.</p>

		<p>I have searched in vain for years for the photograph *I know I still have* of the motorcycle/rider in the hall of building 2. &nbsp;It&#39;s my white whale of MS mementos. &nbsp;Also FWIW, I thought it was Dave at the time.</p>

		<p>I was a summer intern then. &nbsp; &nbsp;I remember the motorcycle burn marks in a hallway, I think it was in Building #5.</p>
<p>I also have a vague memory of something being thrown from the upperlevel of the building lobby and smashing a coffee-table sitting in the lobby.</p>
<p>It was pretty crazy.</p>

		<p>I was thinking about Windows 95 coming up on 20 years ago (released Aug 24, 1995) just a few days ago. &nbsp;If it&#39;s crazy for me to think about that, I can only imagine what it&#39;s like to look at it from the perspective of a developer who&#39;s still working on the next, next, next, next, next, next generation of the operating system :) &nbsp;Congrats on such success kicking off the first of what most people today would still probably recognize as &quot;Windows&quot;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you were so inclined, I know I would be very interested in reading an introspective on the progress from Windows 95 to Windows 10 from your point of view &#8212; what&#39;s changed on the development side, the user side, your favorite highlights, what&#39;s better, what&#39;s worse, and everything in between.</p>
<p>This also must mean that you&#39;ve been at Microsoft for at least 20 years. &nbsp;I hope you got a fancy belt buckle or sword [1] or something else nice!</p>

		<p>@Nico: &nbsp;The 20 year award at Microsoft is a clear glass obelisk, kind of quartz-looking, with a horizontal yellow/amber tint stripe through the middle. &nbsp;You can see the awards by doing a Google image search for &quot;Microsoft 20 year award&quot;.</p>
<p>@Cheong00: &nbsp;A couple Excel developers wrote that. &nbsp;They&#39;d been spending time playing Doom and wanted to write their own 3D game.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
