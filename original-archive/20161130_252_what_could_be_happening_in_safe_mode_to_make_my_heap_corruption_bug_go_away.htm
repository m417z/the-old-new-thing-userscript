<p>
A customer had a program that encountered heap corruption bugs,
and they found that the bugs didn't occur when the system
was running Safe Mode.
What is so special about Safe Mode that makes the bug go away,
and how can we get that Safe Mode-like behavior all the time?
</p>
<p>
While we're at it, let's
<a HREF="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/909/if-aircraft-black-boxes-are-indestructible-why-cant-the-whole-plane-be-made-from-the-same-material">
make the entire plane out of the black box</a>.
</p>
<p>
In Safe Mode, the system loads only essential device drivers,
and in particular, the video driver specifically tailored
for your video card is not used.
Instead, the system uses a plain vanilla video driver
with no hardware acceleration or any other fancy features.
</p>
<p>
The plain vanilla video driver can affect how applications
behave.
Since there is no hardware acceleration,
the program may be sent into alternate code paths which
employ software emulation.
It also changes the video DLLs loaded into the process,
and that will affect the address space layout as well
as alter the process's heap usage.
Both of these things may perturb the memory map enough
so that the buggy behavior manifests itself differently.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose you had a use-after-free bug
that accidentally zeroed a byte of memory that had
already been freed back into the heap.
The change in address space layout means that
the heap may move to a different location in memory,
causing pointers to have slightly different values,
and maybe the result is that in Safe Mode, the pointer
has a value of 0x00123456, so that clearing the high-order
byte to zero has no effect.
Or maybe the change in memory allocation pattern caused by the
switch to the plain video driver means that the
byte that got accidentally zeroed out hadn't yet been
reused by another heap allocation,
so writing to it has no perceptible effect
(because nobody was using it).
</p>
<p>
The heap is a chaotic system,
since it is highly sensitive to the exact pattern
of memory allocation and deallocation (which can
be nondeterministic due to multi-threading),
so it doesn't take much at all to make the
consequences of a heap corruption
bug vary wildly.</p>

		<p>Well, of course Raymond handpicks the cases.  He only uses the ones that are interesting or that illustrate a particular point.  &#8220;Somebody did something stupid&#8221; isn&#8217;t very interesting.</p>

		<p>As it&#8217;s often said, programming is hard. There are many &#8220;StackOverflow programmers&#8221;, and when the code they have patched out of retails taken from StackOverflow &#8220;mysteriously&#8221; fails, I&#8217;m sure they pull all they help they can. If they happen to work for a company that has a support contract with Microsoft, well, Raymond gets new stories for his blog :-) .</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s Safe Mode! It shouldn&#8217;t be too much of a surprise that it makes things safer.</p>
<p>Not that *this* specific case is actually safer, since it could also happen the other way around. Though I&#8217;m sure very few companies would bother trying to track down (or would even ever notice) a bug that only appeared in Safe Mode.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
