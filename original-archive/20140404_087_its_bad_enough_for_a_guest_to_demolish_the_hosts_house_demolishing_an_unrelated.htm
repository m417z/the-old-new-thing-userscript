"How do I destroy a window that belongs to another process?"
</p>
<p>
The <code>Destroy&shy;Window</code> function will not destroy
windows that belong to another thread,
much less another process.
The best you can do is post a
<code>WM_<wbr>CLOSE</code> message to the window to ask it nicely.
The <code>Def&shy;Window&shy;Proc</code> function response to the
<code>WM_<wbr>CLOSE</code> message by destroying the window,
but the window is free to add a custom handler for the
<code>WM_<wbr>CLOSE</code> message which rejects the request.
</p>
<p>
(If you are thinking of posting the
<code>WM_<wbr>DESTROY</code> message,
then you're the sort of person who
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/09/26/10216420.aspx">
prank-calls somebody pretending to be the police</a>.)
</p>
<p>
If you want to distinguish between user-initiated requests to close
the window (say, by clicking the X button in the corner),
and your special, "No, really, just destroy the window" demand
to close the window,
you can invent a private message for this purpose.
</p>
<pre>
#define WM_FORCECLOSE (WM_APP + 3141)

LRESULT CALLBACK VictimWndProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg,
    WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
 switch (uMsg) {
 ...
 case WM_FORCECLOSE: DestroyWindow(hwnd); return 0;
 ...
 }
 return DefWindowProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
}

void ForceCloseWindow(HWND hwnd)
{
 PostMessage(hwnd, WM_FORCECLOSE, 0, 0);
}
</pre>
<p>
Of course, this
<code>WM_<wbr>FORCE&shy;CLOSE</code> message works only
with windows specially designed to understand it.
</p>
<p>
"I can't do that because the window I want to force closed
belongs to some application I did not write,
so I cannot modify its window procedure."
</p>
<p>
This is another case of
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/04/30/10004931.aspx">
<i>If it's not yours,
then don't mess with it without permission from the owner</i></a>.
One of the rules of thumb for real life is that if something
doesn't belong to you,
then you shouldn't mess with it unless you have permission from the owner.
</p>
<p>
You need to work with the application vendor
to come to some sort of agreement on how you can tell the
application to close the window unconditionally.
Otherwise, you're even worse than the guest who
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/11/18/10238335.aspx">
visits a house and calls the demolition company to have the house
destroyed</a>.
You're the guy who calls the demolition company to
<i>order the destruction of some completely unrelated house</i>.
</p>
<p>
How would you like it if a random person called
the demolition company to destroy your house?</p>

		<p>Hijack the thread of the owning window&#39;s message loop to inject the DestroyWindow call. The difficulty of doing this correctly should reduce it&#39;s use to the only reasonable case: correcting sourceless and effectively unsupported programs (think VB6 business apps until proven otherwise).</p>

		<p>I&#39;m always flabbergasted that programmers tend to think that they know better, that they can just blow away other apps, force their software to the front, add extra icons to the desktop and the root of the start menu and the notification area and add pop-ups over the tops of everything else, hide messages globally, and any of a hundred other things because their software is clearly the most important thing ever and everyone must pay attention only to it. &nbsp;Such folks should be publicly executed on national (and international) TV. &nbsp;Perhaps a few heads would get the message across. </p>

		<p>There is one legitimate use for the requested functionality, and that is writing a task/process manager. When youâ€™re a task manager, you send WM_CLOSE, wait for a timeout, and if the victim window still exists, then find out its process and terminate that.</p>

		<p>@Yuri Khan: That&#39;s not what the customer was trying to do according to Raymond, though. &nbsp;They were trying to destroy the window programmatically instead of posting a CLOSE message and letting the window close itself in a more graceful, sane manner. &nbsp;A task manager shouldn&#39;t force-close windows; if you&#39;re at that point, you may as well tear down the entire process.</p>

		<p>My first response (apart from &quot;don&#39;t do that&quot;) would have been CreateRemoteThread. But then you&#39;re still only in the right process, not thread. And as Joshua already noted, hijacking the thread is even worse.</p>
<p>What happens when the associated thread gets destroyed btw? Does the kernel do the some kind of cleanup like it does when the process terminates?</p>

		<p>@Alegr1: I know, but Raymond has just alerted us all to the existence of programs that impersonate the end-user for malicious ends, so the next step is for the rest of us to distinguish between genuine input from an honest, decent upstanding end-user and fake input from a horrid, deceitful &quot;app&quot;.</p>
<p>Coz programming is just a holy war against other (infidel) vendors, right? At least, that&#39;s the message I&#39;m getting from Raymond&#39;s inbox. as reported on this blog. So it stands to reason that we need defensive techniques as well as offensive ones. We shouldn&#39;t just rely on the merciful AppCompat team to protect us.</p>
<p>(* To pick up on Joshua&#39;s reply, I&#39;m not sure that the need to support accessibility tools actually makes the problem any harder than it already is.)</p>

		<p>@Ken Hagan: Clearly, we need to implement a CAPTCHA inside the window message pump to authenticate genuine user input! (Sadly, I can see someone trying just about that, as a &quot;security&quot; measure&#8230;)</p>

		<p>This is the type of thing you end up doing a lot of if you&#39;re providing kiosk mode solutions. Especially when the software doesn&#39;t work properly and needs closing down and reopening regularly (and can&#39;t rely on the user to do it).</p>

		<p>smf: For kiosk solutions, you probably want TerminateProcess or TerminateJobObject. Just trying to destroy a window is not a reliable solution. Of course you could tell the window to close, give it a few seconds, and then terminate the process.</p>

		<p>@Ken Hagan:</p>
<p>Actually this is a real problem although definitely not one which should be solved at the application level. It is really bad that malicious applications can forge user input and snoop on other windows. See <a href="http://qubes-os.org/trac" rel="nofollow" target="_new">http://qubes-os.org/trac</a> for an attempt at solving the problem of GUI isolation.</p>

		<p>What I want to know is: How does uiAccess attribute of requestedExecutionLevel token in the application manifest would factor in. I never studied it, knowing that my apps would never need it and I needed a special digital signature anyway. But now I am curious.</p>
<p>However, the main documentation page of requestedExecutionLevel has mysteriously disappeared from MSDN.</p>

		<p>WM_DESTROY is awesome.</p>
<p>HWND is a pointer (conceptually). &nbsp;WM_DELETE is delete (again conceptually). &nbsp;And so you&#39;re going to release someone else&#39;s pointer, without worrying about who else might have a copy. &nbsp;That&#39;s just an awesome attitude in an app. And then on top of it, you&#39;re going to post the message instead of calling the function &#8212; and so whatever base class cleanup Microsoft would do isn&#39;t going to happen.</p>
<p>That just strikes me as not understanding the platform on which you&#39;re operating, at a fundamental level.</p>

		<p>@Steven Stewart-Gallus</p>
<p>There may be some argument for specific targeted application isolation (sandboxing), but trying to apply it across the board isn&#39;t worth the cost. &nbsp;The flexibility and capabilities provided by the even playing field of a desktop are some of the primary things that set it apart (and make it superior to) more restricted platforms (such as mobile, console, etc).</p>

		<p>That&#39;s like saying Microsoft is discontinuing User Account Control. (Maybe they are. Maybe they&#39;ve decided to make Metro-style apps the only type of apps and forever preventing developers from developing anything without their consent.)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
