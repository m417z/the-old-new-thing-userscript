<p>In response to my story about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/08/07/9859708.aspx"> creative-spelling Scrabble</a>, some people volunteered their own personal variations, like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/08/07/9859708.aspx#9860944"> Plausible Scrabble</a> or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/08/07/9859708.aspx#9860236"> Rude Word Scrabble</a>.</p>
<p> One variation my friends and I sometimes play is <i>Redneck Scrabble</i>. All words must be spelled the way a redneck might spell it. We enjoy playing it, except for my schoolteacher friend for whom it brought back horrible memories of her training, when she was assigned to assist in teaching elementary school in a rural part of the country. </p>
<p> <a href="http://jalpuna.com/archives/2006/07/scrabble.shtml"> This Web site has some other variations</a>. I haven't played <i>Any Language Scrabble</i>, but one of my college friends did; they called it <i>International Scrabble</i>. The game was even crazier than it sounds because that particular circle of friends consisted of people who loved learning foreign languages, so pretty much anything was in play! (I don't know if anybody in the group spoke Czech, but if so, they would have totally cleaned up.) </p>

		<p>Czech? Surely a collection of nerds should be able to come up with a weighting algorithm, so that a Z would be worth much less in Czech or German.</p>

		<p>Can we see some example words from Redneck Scrabble? I live in redneck territory in rural Missouri and so I&#39;m wondering how you think rednecks spell words ;-)</p>

		<p>One thing to note is that international versions of Scrabble have different letter frequencies and values already; see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble_letter_distributions" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Scrabble_letter_distributions</a> for example.</p>
<p>It&#39;d be interesting to use international Scrabble and re-weight every word based on its language of origin. So if you made a word in Czech or German, the Z would only be 2 or 3 points, respectively. With words that exist in multiple languages &#8211; pick whichever gives you the better score.</p>

		<p>My favorite variation on scrabble is to apply a multiplier to the number of words which you connect. &nbsp;In other words simply adding &quot;S&quot; to the end of a word only nets you a 1x score multiplier, but building a word which connects to 3 others will net you a 4x multiplier. &nbsp;This simple rule goes a long way to encouraging &quot;prettier&quot; boards.</p>

		<p>@Mark W, I guess with a loanword you&#39;d have to make it scored as its origin. &nbsp;But that gets funny when you go back one or two hundred years.</p>

		<p>I would be interested in IPA scrabble. &nbsp;The words can be from any language, or an agreed-upon subset of launguages, but instead of letters they are spelled with phonemes, and the phonemes are given points based on how frequently they occur in the whole of human language and on the rarity of the particular allophone being played.</p>

		<p>Aaron: it might be pretty tough to find a second human being also interested in playing that. :) Aren&#39;t there thousands of phonemes?</p>

		<p>If you have a language with characters outside of the range from &#39;A&#39; to &#39;Z&#39; (as in ASCII or Unicode 0x41 to 0x5a), I could see it being an issue determining what encoding of these characters to use, even in Western languages with diacritics, to say nothing of ones that don&#39;t use the Latin alphabet.</p>
<p>I know I&#39;ve played &quot;escrabble&quot; in Spanish, and they have separate pieces for Ch, Ll, Rr, and Ñ.</p>

		<p>I think redneck Scrabble requires that you play GUDE, ENUF, NITE and LITE.</p>
<p>All of which are acceptable in OSPD4. Which is gude enuf for me. (Yes, that&#39;s what GUDE and ENUF mean.)</p>

		<p>What about Protocol/RFC Scrabble? The only words are literals/commands used in protocols.</p>
<p>E.g., from SMTP &#8211; EHLO/HELO, MAILFROM, RCPTTO, DATA</p>
<p>HTTP: GET, POST</p>
<p>POP: USER, PASS, LIST, RETR</p>
<p>FTP: SYST, PORT, TYPE</p>
<p>SSL: STARTTLS</p>
<p>Though I bet someone would propose a gobbledegook RFC just to win.</p>
<p>Oh, and to claim a multiplier (double/triple words/letter score, etc), you have to name the RFC it&#39;s from. Either the base, or one that supercedes it.</p>

		<p>And by gobbledegook RFC, I mean a real protocol. Probably full of long strings with Q/Z in strategic areas&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
