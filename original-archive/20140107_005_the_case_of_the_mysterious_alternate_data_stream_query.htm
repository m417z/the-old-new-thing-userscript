<p>A customer was running Windows Server 2003 ("Still in support until 2015!") and they have some custom application that monitors all disk accesses. They noticed that there were a lot of failed Alternate Data Stream queries coming from Explorer, and that was causing the custom application's logs to fill with largely useless information.</p>
<p> These Alternate Data Stream queries are being made in order to extract file metadata for the pop-up infotip. (Windows later abandoned the use of Alternate Data Streams for file metadata since Alternate Data Streams were so fragile and were easily damaged or lost.) </p>
<p> The customer found that if they unchecked <i>Show pop-up description for folder and desktop items</i>, this solved the problem on some of their machines, but not all of them. They asked the Explorer team what else needs to be done to stop the ADS queries. </p>
<p> The piece they were missing was the status bar. If the status bar is enabled, then it shows the same information that would have appeared in the infotip. </p>
<p> Turning off the status bar fixed their problem. </p>

		<p>According to our benchmarks, W2k3 outperforms all others right up to the point where hardware support for newer hardware is missing.</p>

		<p>Still I think that filtering the logs is a better solution than fragile UI tweaks that limit OS usability. PS. Win2k3 forever!</p>

		<p>First thing I always do starting explorer on a new machine is ENABLE the status bar. Same thing with browsers, if they even still have status bar.</p>

		<p>God, I miss those blog posts that started with &quot;The case of &#8230;&quot; made by a certain person. (I am to name no names, right?)</p>
<p>@Azarien: Not really, no. Windows Server 2003 most of the times runs unattended.</p>

		<p>I see a new change in Windows 8.1 &#8211; that the icon of a custom library is stored in an Alternate Data Stream and not in the XML file of the Library when the icon is changed using Windows dialog. But if the XML is manually edited, the icon in the XML takes priority. Any reason why it is stored in an Alternate Data Stream?</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command</p>
<p>If you&#39;re talking about Russinovich&#39;s &quot;Case of the Unexplained&quot; series, I believe he only posts them when he gets a good submission. They&#39;re (almost) entirely submitter-driven.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230;since Alternate Data Streams were so fragile and were easily damaged or lost.&quot;</p>
<p>It makes me really sad that&#39;s the case. I really wish that you could use xattrs and ADSs as reliably as the main data streams.</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command: no one expects that such a pure UI setting would affect the business process. Imagine a new admin, logging to the server &#8211; and the first thing he does is to enable Explorer&#39;s status bar. &quot;what did you do!?&quot; &quot;um&#8230; nothing?&quot;</p>

		<p>@Anon: Close, but no cigar. (And you named him, not me.) I meant &quot;The Case of &#8230;&quot; posts which were awesome&#8230; until a certain event in his life (in our lives) came to pass. I am not saying they are cause and effect; just a time ref.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
