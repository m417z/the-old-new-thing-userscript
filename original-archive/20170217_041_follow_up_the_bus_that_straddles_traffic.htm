<p>
In 2010,
the world was amazed at the
<a HREF="https://www.wired.com/2010/10/straddling-bus-coming-to-america/">
traffic-straddling bus</a>,
whose inventors announced
plans to begin work "as soon as 2011".
</p>
<p>
And then the world forgot about this invention
that left them so breathless just moments ago.
</p>
<p>
And then,
in 2016,
the world was amazed at the
<a HREF="https://arstechnica.co.uk/cars/2016/08/china-has-built-a-crazy-elevated-bus-that-straddles-traffic/">
traffic-straddling bus</a>,
which conceded that it currently just
runs
"back and forth on a short, straight stretch of road."
</p>
<p>
And then the world forgot about this invention
that left them so breathless just moments ago.
</p>
<p>
Well,
it turns out that the
<a HREF="http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-china-straddling-bus-2016-story.html">
traffic-straddling bus</a>
is sitting abandoned over half of a four-lane road.
Shortly after the announcement in 2016,
the company was accused of swindling its investors.
The company stopped answering the phone.
The office doors are locked.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if the world will be amazed by their next
promotional video.</p>

		<p>Something like that. Given there is space limitation, the rail could be built along and above the center of mainstream roads and have footbridges connect to the ground at stations. Make it circular lines so there will not be need to build line in reverse direction, further saving the cost to build rails and platforms.</p>

		<p>Did I really just find Worms (Armageddon) player &#8220;Muzer&#8221; in here? Wow&#8230; that&#8217;s amazing!</p>

		<p>Even if it&#8217;s not crowdfunding project, and the idea is genuine, a new funded company can still vanish in a year or so unless backed by the government (not necessarily financially, but has to have government officials offer &#8220;green light&#8221; on various things).</p>
<p>Welcome to China.</p>
<p>That said, I found the design of bus a bit problematic to run on roads of China.</p>
<p>First is the height of the bus. Unless the bus only runs on road at countryside, the bus won&#8217;t pass the flyovers, that means it won&#8217;t run inside the cities. And then seems it won&#8217;t turn at street corners. Both of this makes the bus only possible to run at inter-cities roads. However on these roads the vehicles running there are most buses and trucks, that means the bus would need to be about 1.5m taller.</p>
<p>Then again unless during Chinese new year, those mainstream roads are not that traffic congested to make the invention desirable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s somewhat doomed to fail in the very beginning.</p>

		<p>The idea has obvious appeal, who hasn&#8217;t sat in traffic wishing they had a way to drive above the other cars.  The restrictions though are so obvious and limiting it seems like the city would have to be built around the idea.  Where could you plausibly deploy this?</p>

		<p>It seems to me that you are <b>completely</b> missing the vision. Just think about it. A future where normal cars are stuck in the traffic and there are traffic-straddling buses freely running everywhere. So much everywhere, in fact, that they will be stuck in traffic, too and so the need will arise for buses able to go over traffic-straddling buses (double straddling buses). And the best part is that the whole story can be repeated ad libitum&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
