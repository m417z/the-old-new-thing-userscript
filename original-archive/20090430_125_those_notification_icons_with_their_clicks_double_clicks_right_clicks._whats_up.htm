<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p>(A completely feeble attempt to mimic <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/">Michael Kaplan</a>'s blog entry titles which carry a much stronger voice.)</p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jonathanh/"> Jonathan Hardwick</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jonathanh/archive/2004/12/19/327145.aspx"> made a short table of inconsistencies in how various programs handle clicks on their notification icons</a>. How are these supposed to work? </p>
<p> The final decision is up to the application, since it is the one that receives the mouse clicks and decides what to do. But what were the intended semantics for clicks on the notification icon? </p>
<p> <b>Left single click</b>: Display a simple interface item targetting the casual user. In most cases, this would be a context menu, but if you are something like the volume control, then a custom interface item (in this case, a slider control for controlling the volume) may be more appropriate. </p>
<p> <b>Right single click</b>: Display a context menu, but one which can contain options for more advanced users. In many cases, the menu will be identical to the left single click menu. (Important: See tomorrow's entry for additional discussion.) </p>
<p> As for double-clicks, you don't need a special rule because there is already a general principle for what double-clicks mean: The double-click action, generally speaking, is equivalent to viewing the context menu and choosing the default action. </p>
<p> For the programs on Jonathan's list, then, the actions should go like this: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Left single click</b>: Display a context menu showing     applicable quick-access actions, with <b>Open</b> being the     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/29/235737.aspx">     boldfaced default menu item</a>. </li>
<li><b>Left double click</b>: Open the application window. </li>
</ul>
<p> Note that if you go for the left single click, you'll run into a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/10/15/242761.aspx"> half-second delay</a> because the icon is waiting to determine whether that first click is a standalone single click or whether it is the first half of an upcoming double-click. </p>
<p> Oh, and here's that further discussion on right clicks: The right click and left click distinction was an attempt to provide advanced functionality to advanced users, on the principle that most users don't really use the right mouse button much and will click with the left button by default. This was especially true back when the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface guidelines were being developed, since the right mouse button was barely used at all in Windows&nbsp;3.1. It's a new button, may as well use it for something new. In the intervening years, however, things have changed. The right mouse button is much more heavily used by applications, and even novice users are accustomed to right-clicking on things. Consequently, knowledge of the right mouse button no longer carries the <i>mark of the geek</i> that it once did. In fact, there is a nontrivial class of users who are accustomed to right-clicking on icons as their primary means of interacting with them. </p>
<p> The fact that applications which create notification icons historically have done a poor job of distinguishing the left click ("basic function menu") from the right click ("advanced function menu") only makes the distinction even more meaningless. For notification icons, the consequences of this shift in usage patterns and the general confusion in the world of applications that create notification icons is that you are probably best off making your right click menu the same as your left click menu. </p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: Here's a link to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511448(loband).aspx#guidelines"> official guidance</a> regarding how users interact with notification icons. </p>

		<p>What&#8217;s worse is that Jonathan refers to the notification area as the &quot;system tray&quot;, even though his article was written more than a year after Raymond&#8217;s &quot;There&#8217;s no such thing as the &#8216;system tray&#8217;&quot; article (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/10/54831.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/10/54831.aspx</a>).</p>

		<p>A notable example is &quot;safe device removal&quot; icon. Only after long time, it happened to me that you should use left click and wait for the menu, rather than use right click and open that big ugly confusing dialog (&quot;Stop&quot; button? Why Stop?).</p>

		<p>&quot;even novice users are accustomed to right-clicking on things&quot;</p>
<p>I expect they&#8217;re just scared. I know I am. I&#8217;ve never met an application that did anything more violent than put up a menu when you right clicked, but I&#8217;ve encountered plenty that took a single left-click as permission to go and do something. Beter safe than sorry, so I generally right-click when I&#8217;m exploring a new area.</p>

		<p>I have a friend, who while very intelligent, is at best borderline computer literate. Somehow right-clicking has become dominant in her. When I&#8217;m giving her tech support, it&#8217;s almost guaranteed that some time during the conversation I&#8217;ll say &quot;Unless I specifically say it&#8217;s a right-click, I always mean a left-click.&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m pleased to hear I got the behaviour of my program&#8217;s notification icon correct &#8211; cool.</p>
<p>Now if I can just work out what I need to do to stop that intermittent bug where the notification area doesn&#8217;t get redrawn properly when the menu is dismissed, leaving bits of menu on it. :-(</p>
<p>Quite a few other programs seem to do it, so at least I&#8217;m in good company.</p>

		<p>I prefer alternative behaviour from notification icons. &nbsp;Some of them do this, but some don&#8217;t:</p>
<p>Left single click: do nothing</p>
<p>Left double click: open program window</p>
<p>Right single click: display menu</p>
<p>Right double click: do default action on menu (which is usually to open the window)</p>
<p>Not that people tend to right double click much&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Alexandre Grigoriev</p>
<p>I did the same thing for *years*, despite using Windows since 3.1. It had never actually occurred to me to left-click on a notification icon, ever, until late last year. I always double-clicked (to open the program) or right-clicked. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why I did this. I guess it was because they didn&#8217;t &quot;look&quot; left-clickable like buttons, or because frequently the right-click menu was similar enough to the left-click menu, unlike in Windows 7 where they get a hover effect when you go over them and the left- vs right-click options are widely different.</p>
<p>So I used to always go through that insane &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot; dialog to stop my USB drive, and curse Microsoft while thinking &quot;Why is stopping a USB drive so insanely difficult?&quot; When someone showed the left-click, my jaw hit the floor. I felt like a moron. I was a stupid user, too!</p>

		<p>&quot;This was especially true back when the Windows 95 user interface guidelines were being developed, since the right mouse button was barely used at all in Windows 3.1. It&#8217;s a new button, may as well use it for something new.&quot;</p>
<p>This was nothing new for people have have used OS/2 2.x before. (Don&#8217;t know about 1.x, though). In fact, I was very disappointed that right clicking did not proove as helpfull on Win95 than it was on OS/2.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
