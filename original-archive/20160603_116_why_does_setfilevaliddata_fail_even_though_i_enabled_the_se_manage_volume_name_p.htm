A customer reported that their call to
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110922-00/?p=9573">
<code>Set&shy;File&shy;Valid&shy;Data</code></a>
was failing
with
<code>ERROR_<wbr>PRIVILEGE_<wbr>NOT_<wbr>HELD</code>
despite the fact that they held the
privilege whose name is defined by the symbol
<code>SE_<wbr>MANAGE_<wbr>VOLUME_<wbr>NAME</code>.
(Note that the "name" in "manage volume name" doesn't mean that
you are managing the name of the volume;
rather it means "This is the name of the privilege for
managing volumes.")
</p>
<p>
The customer was kind enough to
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20131018-00/?p=2893">
reduce</a>
the problem to a simple program:
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
 // This succeeds
 HANDLE h = CreateFileW(L"test", GENERIC_WRITE, 0, nullptr,
   CREATE_ALWAYS, FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING | FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED,
   nullptr);

 LARGE_INTEGER newSize;
 newSize.QuadPart = 256 * 1024 * 10;
 // This succeeds
 SetFilePointerEx(h, newSize, nullptr, FILE_BEGIN);

 // This succeeds
 SetEndOfFile(h);

 HANDLE hToken;
 // This succeeds
 OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(),
      TOKEN_ADJUST_PRIVILEGES | TOKEN_QUERY, &amp;hToken);

 // This succeeds
 <a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa446619(v=vs.85).aspx">SetPrivilege</a>(hToken, SE_MANAGE_VOLUME_NAME, TRUE);

 // This succeeds
 CloseHandle(hToken);

 // This fails with ERROR_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD
 SetFileValidData(h, newSize.QuadPart);

 CloseHandle(h);

 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
The answer is hidden in
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa365544(v=vs.85).aspx">
the documentation for the
<code>Set&shy;File&shy;Valid&shy;Data</code> function</a>:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
A caller must have the
<b>SE_<wbr>MANAGE_<wbr>VOLUME_<wbr>NAME</b>
privilege enabled when opening a file initially.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The program didn't enable the manage volume privilege until
after it had already created the file handle.
</p>
<p>
This requirement that the privilege be active at the point the
handle is created becomes less surprising
when you realize that the general
policy for kernel object security is that security is checked at the
time handles are created,
rather than when they are used.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s obvious. After reading the code and without reading the documentation quote, I realized the problem. Checking the privileges when creating the handle, as the NT kernel does, makes a lot of sense: its very efficient (a single handle can be used for hundreds or thousands of operations), it&#8217;s coherent (once opened, you don&#8217;t have to worry for it to stop working out of the blue), and it does that at the cost of ignoring at infrequent corner case: changing permissions or privileges after opening.</p>

		<p>&gt; and it does that at the cost of ignoring at infrequent corner case: changing permissions or privileges after opening.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s actually a feature because it allows you to drop privileges when they are no longer needed while still having access to what you need to work on.</p>

		<p>Security people see it as a bug, not a feature.  It even has its own name, TOCTOU,  time of check/time of use, a race condition where you verify the privilege at the wrong time.</p>

		<p>In this case it is specifically a security feature: checking the permissions at the time of the handle creation rather than use means that you can safely pass handles from low-privilege scopes to high-privilege scopes, without the high-permission side getting tricked into using its privileges when it didn&#8217;t intend to.  UNIX does the same thing for the same reason.</p>

		<p>So, the value behind SE_MANAGE_VOLUME_NAME is the name of the privilege, and &#8220;SE_MANAGE_VOLUME_NAME&#8221; is what the privilege&#8217;s name is called. I take it that the privilege itself is called SE_MANAGE_VOLUME. All we need to know now is what the privilege *is* (&#8220;A-Sitting on a Gate&#8221;[0], perhaps?) and we&#8217;re done!</p>
<p>&#8230;any further comparisons between Microsoft APIs and other classic works of nonsense literature are left as an exercise for the reader ;-)</p>

		<p>A privilege is, of course, a-sitting on a gate that controls access to something.</p>

		<p>Does that mean a handle has additional permission mask which is not part of the standard 32 bit mask?</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think it does. My guess is that it has an standard permission mask that gets assigned at the time of opening in function of the requested permissions and the user&#8217;s actual permissions. Later, operations on the handle are quickly checked against that local permission mask. Anyway, wether it works that way or other, it&#8217;s an implementation detail.</p>

		<p>Handle entry doesn&#8217;t have captured priviledges. I guess IO manager or even FS driver does this tracking.<br />
There&#8217;re also some inconsistencies:<br />
&#8211;  For access rights its rather obvious that they&#8217;re checked only when CreateFile called since there is parameter with declared access rights needed, like I will write to file using this handle. But there is nothing to declare &#8216;I will hmm.. manage volume by this handle&#8217; :) So its kind of semantic inconsistency.<br />
&#8211; Functions RegRestoreKey/RegBackupKey require SE_RESTORE_NAME/SE_BACKUP_NAME privileges respectively. But AFAIR they checks for it against current caller, but not the one who opened handle to key beinf restored/backed up. So its inconsistency with older API behaviour.</p>

		<p>&gt; Note that the &#8220;name&#8221; in &#8220;manage volume name&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean that you are managing the name of the volume; rather it means &#8220;This is the name of the privilege for managing volumes.&#8221;</p>
<p>It always amazed me how English has no morphological difference between nouns and adjectives, and the function is determined by the word order, which fails spectacularly if there are more than two words in the expression, like, is it &#8220;(manage volume) name&#8221; or &#8220;manage (volume name)&#8221;?</p>

		<p>But if apps hungarian (appropriately adapted for all-uppercase macros) were being used, the problem would go away.</p>
<p>SE_PRVLGNAME_MANAGE_VOLUME</p>
<p>&#8220;Privilege name&#8221; is the category of the value, and &#8220;manage volume&#8221; identifies the particular one.  An alphabetical sort will then also group all the privilege names together, which is far more useful than grouping all the &#8220;SE_MANAGE*&#8221; stuff together.</p>
<p>In a language that supports namespaces and/or scoped enums, it might be Security::PrivilegeName::MANAGE_VOLUME</p>
<p>English adjective-noun word order does not work as well as hierarchical systems for identifier naming.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
