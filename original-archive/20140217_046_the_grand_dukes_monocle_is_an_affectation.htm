		<p>&#8230; or he uses a monocle in one eye for near vision, and with the other eye he has distance vision. &nbsp;Depending on which is most important at any particular time, will decide whether the monocle is in the dominant eye or not.</p>
<p>(Clearly the idea that Disney&#39;s continuity failed is ridiculous &#8211; they are professionals, and wouldn&#39;t do that sort of thing.)</p>

		<p>Martin Bonner has the best explanation for this happening in reality, anyway: known as &#39;monovision&#39;, where one eye gets a different correction than the other, often with either different prescriptions of contact lens or different laser treatments with LASIK/LASEK. That way, instead of having to put reading glasses (or a monocle!) on and take them off every time you shift between distance and close vision, you have one eye optimized for each. (I hate that idea, personally: I&#39;d much rather have symmetry and use reading glasses when needed, but apparently some people adapt and prefer it that way. Others get horribly disoriented by the split and regret it!)</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s only short (or long) sighted in one eye &#8211; just that he only wants correction in one. I imagine a monocle might well have been used for reading purposes in this way &#8211; so it wouldn&#39;t matter which eye it was in, just that one eye was corrected for close vision while leaving the other for distance.</p>

		<p>Note that the lens has no refraction. It&#39;s a shading lens, Of Courseâ„¢! He just chooses which eye gets shaded (to rest?) at a time.</p>

		<p>I think jas88 hit it. This would, of course, allow for both near and far to be in focus at the same time in different eyes. If he has the right mind-type to process this he could read and be well-aware of his surroundings at the same time. Might be beneficial in late medieval times.</p>

		<p>There was a time where a lot of people wore monocles. It doesn&#39;t mean that there was an epidemic of one-sided myopia.</p>

		<p>Alas I recently had to abandon my beloved monocle in favour of a pince-nez. Its cord would become entangled with that of my pocket watch while verifying the time during my morning constitutional. This action, requiring both hands to move in unison during a brisk walk, has lost its ease and fluidity with age.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
