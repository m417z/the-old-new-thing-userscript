<p>My frequent bicycling buddy Ari Pernick wrote a couple of articles over on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/"> Windows Network Development</a> blog on the topic of the <code>index.dat</code> file, which appears to have gotten a bit of attention lately.</p>

</ul>
<p> This past weekend, I joined Ari and another friend in a ride along the Upper Loop of the annual <a href="http://www.tourdepeaks.com/"> Tour De Peaks</a> bicycle ride. I'd never done this ride before; I tend to do the same routes over and over. This doesn't bother me like it does other people. We had originally planned to do both the Upper and Lower loops (50km each for a total of 100km), and Ari chatted with one of the ride organizers about the characteristics of the two routes in order to decide which one to take first. During the discussion, the gentleman mentioned the "food committee". That reminded me that one of Tour De Peaks' claims to fame is that it has the best food of any Northwest bicycle ride. We ended up abandoning after the first half, because both Ari and I had other things we needed to get done that weren't on our schedule when we originally signed up for the ride. But we did have the food, and it lived up to the hype. The breakfast table included fresh fruit, juice, organic coffee, muffins, and mini-bagels; lunch included pasta, potato salad, salmon quesadillas, sandwiches, pizza, brownies, and caramel popcorn. Sure beats a bottle of water and a <a href="http://www.clifbar.com/"> Clif Bar</a>. Highly recommended. </p>
<p> More than once, somebody pointed out to me that the cap was missing from my water bottle. I do that on purpose. After taking a few gulps, I tuck the open bottle in my back pocket. (Bicycling shirts have pockets on the back for convenience. I keep the water there instead of in the bottle cage since most bottles not specifically designed for it are too small for the cage and end up rattling around and eventually falling out.) That way, when I want a drink of water, I can just reach back, grab a few mouthfuls, and tuck it back into my shirt pocket&mdash;I don't like drinking from those sport bottle tops. The water delivery rate is just too slow! </p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t speak for the Chinese &quot;Camel Bags&quot; linked above, but I love my Camelbak. &nbsp;Since it has chest and waist straps it does not move about much, and since it gets lighter as you ride, you rarely notice it. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a lot more popular with mountain bikers, but I like using it on long road bike rides to keep a lot of water on me and not need to carry a bunch of bottles or worry about refilling.</p>

		<p>Hmmm, from memory I don&#8217;t seem to recall sweat evaporation being a problem. The longest ride where I used one was ~12 miles in Sacramento this past March. The bag itself gave no discomfort, even when full. What I disliked was the odd taste the water had, but that may have been peculiar to the particular bag I used.</p>
<p>And thanks Phil, the camelBak is what I was referring to. I searched for Camel Bag and psoted the first link that looked &quot;correct&quot;</p>

		<p>Some of the CamelBak things have special ventilation panels to ensure the air flows around the bag and over your back. They also let you carry other stuff like an mp3 player or whatever.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
