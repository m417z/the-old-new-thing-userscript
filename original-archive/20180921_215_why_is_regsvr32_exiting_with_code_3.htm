A customer had a script to set up a virtual
machine, but this call was failing:
</p>
<pre>
regsvr32 /s /n /i:u Awesome.dll
</pre>
<p>
The DLL failed to register, and <code>regsvr32</code>
exited with code 3.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180920-00/?p=99785">
Last time</a>,
we saw exit code 3 means that the
<code>Load&shy;Library</code> call failed.
The customer reported that the error was not consistent,
and they've been working around it by waiting a little while
and retrying the operation.
But sometimes, even after a few retries,
the operation still fails.
</p>
<p>
The were running <code>regsvr32</code> in silent mode,
so no error messages were displayed to the user.
</p>
<p>
According to
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180920-00/?p=99785">
the table from last time</a>, step 3 is the
<code>Load&shy;Library</code> step.
Since the problem was random and sometimes cleared up after
a few retries,
this ruled out systematic errors like copying the file
to the wrong directory,
or copying the wrong version of the file.
Those types of errors would result in the operation failing
consistently, rather than randomly.
</p>
<p>
I suspected that the <code>Load&shy;Library</code> failed
because the file was still in use,
either because it was still being copied to the VM,
or because it was being scanned or blocked by anti-malware software
running in the VM.
</p>
<p>
One option for digging further is to
run <code>regsvr32</code> one last time in non-silent
mode, so that the error details are on the screen.
They could write an automation client that scrapes the message
before dismissing the dialog box.
If they go the automation client route, they may as well
<i>always</i> run <code>regsvr32</code> in non-silent mode.
</p>
<p>
If the team doesn't have experience with writing automation,
they could just set a watchdog on <code>regsvr32</code>.
Pick a generous amount of time to cover typical running time
of <code>regsvr32</code> in the success cases.
If <code>regsvr32</code> has not returned by then, then take a
screen shot and then terminate the <code>regsvr32</code> proces.
</p>
<p>
Or they could write their own program
that tries to <code>Load&shy;Library</code> their DLL and captures
the <code>Get&shy;Last&shy;Error</code>.
Run the custom program once the first <code>regsvr32</code> fails.
They could even turn on
<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/show-loader-snaps">
loader snaps</a>
to get extremely detailed information about the
<code>Load&shy;Library</code> operation;
that information will pinpoint exactly where it went wrong.
</p>
<p>
Another option is to run <code>regsvr32</code> under the debugger
with loader snaps enabled and tell the debugger to log all output
to a file.
</p>
<pre>
cdb -Ggx -logo log.txt regsvr32 /s /n i:u Awesome.dll
</pre>
<p>
If the DLL registers successfully, then delete the log file.
If it fails, then save the log file somewhere for analysis.
</p>
<p>
Yet another possibility is that the exit code of 3 is a red herring.
Perhaps something went wrong in a way that led to the C runtime
calling the <code>abort()</code> function,
which
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110519-00/?p=10623">
exits the program with code 3</a>.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
