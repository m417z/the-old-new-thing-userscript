Friendly Police Department Tip #001 - Nightly Nude Jogging: 
</p>
<p>
On Jan 27th at 3:30am, an officer on the south side of
a large corporate campus near 15320 NE 40 St
observed an unknown male running outside.
After seeing nude buttocks illuminated by a street light,
she and another officer contacted the jogger,
who was wearing nothing but black Sketcher sneakers.
Concerned for the cold weather, he was placed in a patrol vehicle. 
</p>
<p>
When questioned,
he stated "he was trying to build up his immune system to
fight the cold weather". 
</p>
<p>
In case you weren't aware,
nude jogging could be considered indecent exposure.
In this instance, he was not charged, as there were no victims.
</p>
<p>
We do not have pictures to share of this incident. You are welcome.
</p>

		<p>I remember hearing about a case where some woman was laughed out of court while suing a nude jogger for indecent exposure, in no small part because she had learned where the guy was used to jogging and went there specifically to be &#8220;shocked&#8221; by the dreadful sight and sue the guy over it.</p>

		<p>Is this dated January 30? Frankly, the tone is more appropriate for a note signed on April 1&#8230;</p>
<p>As for the poor guy, he may not know that for some designs the only difference between being considered obscene or fashionable is the absence or presence of a sports clothing company on it&#8230;</p>

		<p>Raymond, we all know you were the jogger. Just admit it.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a conversation that I just had with a friend of mine who administrates a game server. He told me how people are shocked that there is a &#8220;full nude&#8221; setting in the game, and that many want it to be off. We both are in disbelief now: Where is the logic in &#8220;it&#8217;s offending to show male and female private parts, but it&#8217;s fine to display violence and blood splatter on the screen&#8221;? Well, so much about &#8220;indecent exposure&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not a nudist, but what&#8217;s wrong with nude jogging, and how can there be victims? I mean, a victim to witness a human being in its natural state? Okay, we all know there are many folks that we rather do not like to see this way, but so what? Just don&#8217;t watch. Not everybody who shows his or her private parts is a sex offender or the like, but I see the scare tactics are in place and working.</p>
<p>To come back to the game: He certainly left the &#8220;full nude&#8221; setting in its ON state. :) But he really misses a &#8220;no violence&#8221; and &#8220;no blood&#8221; setting.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m reminded of one time I watched The Godfather on Lifetime or someother daytime movie channel.  We saw Sonny beat up Carlo in the street (granted, one of the worst pulled-punches every shot) and then (SPOILER ALERT) Sonny shot to death at the turnpike &#8230; but the brief shot of Michael&#8217;s fiancee&#8217;s nipples &#8211; heavily pixelated.</p>

		<p>I want to mention that there are sufficiently loose, light, drafty pairs of running shorts on the market that this man could get virtually the same immune-system preparation without worrying about offending anybody.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
