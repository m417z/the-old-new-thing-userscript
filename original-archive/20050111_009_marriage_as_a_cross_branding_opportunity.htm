<p> Oh, nevermind. This wasn't a marriage. It was a joint branding agreement! </p>
<p> My favorite Brad/Jennifer memory was when cardiologist Robert Atkins, famous for his eponymous low-carb diet, suffered a fatal head injury, and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2937849.stm"> the BBC news report was illustrated with a picture of... Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston</a>. </p>

		<p>We call it dirt and smut when celebrities break up and have huge fights (though the zinger from tom Arnold had about having sex with Rosanne being like landing a Boeing 747 in the grand canyon is still a classic) and we complain about how self-centered they are.  And then they whine about the media and we call them hypocrites.  Frankly, I far prefer the Pitt/Aniston kinda breakup to the other one.</p>
<p>Secondly, a lot of &quot;normal&quot; people break up with the same fears about image, and how they&#8217;ll be perceived (especially in cultures where separations still aren&#8217;t the norm).  And a lot of them break up and act like children&#8230;so really we aren&#8217;t any different.</p>
<p>I guess you&#8217;re damned if you do and your damned if you don&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>In a way, it was a joint branding agreement.  As I understand it, the two own a production company together.  This might be the brand they are referring to.</p>
<p>From imdb: &quot;Along with wife Jennifer Aniston and friend Brad Grey, he owns Plan B Entertainment.&quot;</p>

		<p>So how are they going to maintain the brand? Will we be able to select a &#8216;Jennifer Aniston Classic&#8217; skin during movies which will simulate the old version?</p>

		<p>Do you even know that &quot;until death do us part&quot; was a part of their vows?  What kind of ceremony it was?  There are many different forms of marriage besides the Catholic/christian one.  From what I recall, it was a pretty successfully private ceremony with perhaps the only public information being the attendees gleaned from scummy media in helicopters with telephoto lenses.</p>
<p>This off-target railing against divorce seems pretty out of place in an otherwise great technical blog, but I suppose that&#8217;s one of the downsides of following blogs.</p>

		<p>My wife and I never promised &quot;until death do us part&quot; because although we&#8217;d like that we don&#8217;t see any sense in staying married if we come to a point where we could no longer be happy together. Plus we are not religious so we got married in a register office, where any religious text is not allowed.</p>
<p>Divorcing over a major difference is better than trying to paper over it, having children, and making their lives miserable too.</p>

		<p>That BBC article is great.</p>
<p>&quot;He added that doctors described the 72-year-old&#8217;s condition as &quot;very serious&quot;. </p>
<p>Followers of the Atkins diet are allowed to eat unlimited meat, eggs, fish and shellfish.&quot;</p>
<p>But just goes to show, no matter how much meat, eggs, and shellfish a person eats&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t do anything for their balance on ice&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
