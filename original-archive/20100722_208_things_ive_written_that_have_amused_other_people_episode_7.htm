<p>A customer asked for advice on how to accomplish something, the details of which are not important, except to say that what they were trying to do was far more complicated than the twenty-word summary would suggest. And I wasn't convinced that it was a good idea, sort of like asking for advice on how to catch a baseball in your teeth or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/07/12/3821577.aspx"> pick all the cheese off your cheeseburger</a>.</p>
<p> I explained several of the pitfalls of their approach, the ones that I could think of off the top of my head, things they need to watch out for or take precautions against, and I concluded with the sentence, "This idea is fraught with peril, and I fear that my answers to your questions will be interpreted as approval rather than reluctant assistance." </p>
<p> That sentence immediately went into many people's Raymond-quotes file. </p>

		<p>[ i agree with rick. The customer probably read up to the answers and then just stopped reading. ]</p>
<p>The difference with a forum/newsgroup is that there the reply would be &quot;tl,dr; could you write that for me? :)&quot; (or, better: &quot;plz give meh teh codez xD&quot;).</p>

		<p>It sounds a bit like what may have happened to our chief statistician in Canada. Reading between the lines, the politicians took his discussion about what he would do if they changed the rules as acceptance of the rule change. He finally had to resign to get his point across. He should have used your quote in the first place.</p>

		<p>Rick C said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Wouldn&#39;t it have made sense to make that the FIRST sentence</p>
<p>  of your reply?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Not really no, as people would tend to ignore the first sentence as useless preamble. If they&#39;ve been following a chain of Q/A style answers, it seems natural to continue to read the last item in the list (even though it may seem out of place). Anyway, in the end it&#39;s subjective, so any decision is arguable one way or the other, so pick an approach and see if it works.</p>

		<p>Very nice! &nbsp;I am going to have to remember that line:</p>
<p>&quot;This idea is fraught with peril, and I fear that my answers to your questions will be interpreted as approval rather than reluctant assistance.&quot;</p>
<p>I cannot tell you the number of times I have gone out of my way to explain the difficulties of someone&#39;s idea to do xyz but as soon as I explained how it might be done, they go around and tell EVERYBODY that, &quot;James told me exactly how to do this and according to him everything will be just fine!&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
