One of the purposes of my
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/29/403298.aspx">
dialog manager series</a>
was to help people diagnose problems with their dialog boxes.
But since I embedded the tips inside the series body,
it's hard for people to find them,
and I still end up answering the same questions over and over.
</p>
<p>
So here it is in a separate article that hopefully people can find.
</p>
<p>
Why your call to <code>Dialog&shy;Box</code> or
<code>Create&shy;Dialog</code> is failing.
This also goes for <code>CDialog::<wbr>Do&shy;Modal</code>,
but perhaps extra so because the MFC source code says
</p>
<pre>
* 3) CreateDialogIndirect() did NOT create the window (ie. due to error in template)
*    and returns NULL. 
</pre>
<p>
even though the problem is rarely due to an error in the template.
A wrong comment is worse than no comment at all.&sup1;
</p>
<p>
I've decided to put the reasons in most-likely-error-first order
rather than chronological.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your dialog template uses a custom control which has not
been registered.
</ul>
<p>
This is by far the number one reason why dialog boxes fail
to be created.
As we saw in
<a HREF="blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/31/404108.aspx">
Part&nbsp;3</a>,
if a child control cannot be created from the template,
then the dialog creation fails.
(There is a special dialog box style
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff729172%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
<code>DS_<wbr>NO&shy;FAIL&shy;CREATE</code></a> that tells the dialog manager
to ignore the error and just continue without the child control.)
</p>
<p>
For example, maybe your dialog box template uses a List View
control, but you forgot to call
<code>Init&shy;Common&shy;Controls</code> or
<code>Init&shy;Common&shy;Controls&shy;Ex</code>.
Or it uses a Rich Edit control and you forgot to
load
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb787873%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
the appropriate library</a>.
Or it contains an ActiveX control but you forgot to
call
<code>Afx&shy;Enable&shy;Control&shy;Container</code>
to enable ActiveX control hosting.
</p>
<p>
A special case of this error is where your
dialog template uses a custom control which was
registered in a different activation context.
If you are trying to use a control from version&nbsp;6
of the common controls, then you must
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb773175%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
use the appropriate manifest</a>
and make sure that the manifest's activation context is active at the time
you call <code>Dialog&shy;Box</code> or whatever.
If you forget to do this, then you will be using whatever activation
context happens to be lying around at the time you call
<code>Dialog&shy;Box</code>,
and it may not be the one you want.
(It's like walking up to a computer and looking on the Desktop
and not seeing the file you created yesterday.
"Hey, who deleted my file!"
But you forgot to do a Switch User to your own account.
You're looking at the Desktop of whoever used the computer last.
You're in the wrong context.)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your resource name is incorrectly declared in the resource template.
</ul>
<p>
One of the annoying features of the Resource Compiler is that it
happily accepts typos!
For example, suppose you have the following resource header file:
</p>
<pre>
// ids.h

#define IDD_BRILLIANT 100
</pre>
<p>
and the following resource file:
</p>
<pre>
<a HREF="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The_Brillant_Paula_Bean.aspx">IDD_BRILLANT</a> DIALOG ...
</pre>
<p>
Since you misspelled <code>IDD_<wbr>BRILLIANT</code>,
you are not in fact creating a dialog box whose ID is 100
(which is what would have happened if you had spelled it correctly).
Instead, you're creating a dialog whose name is the string
<code>"IDD_BRILLANT"</code>.
</p>
<p>
Later, your code passes
<code>MAKE&shy;INT&shy;RESOURCE(IDD_BRILLIANT)</code> to ask for dialog 100,
and the dialog manager says, "Sorry, I don't see one of those."
(To get the typo'd dialog template, you would have to pass
<code>TEXT("IDD_BRILLANT")</code> as the template name.)
</p>
<p>
Even if you spell everything correctly, you will also have this problem
if you forget to
<code>#include "ids.h"</code> in your resource template file
in the first place!
</p>
<p>
To diagnose this error,
you can
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/29/403298.aspx">
add a diagnostic call to
<code>Find&shy;Resource</code></a>
(or simply trace through the dialog manager's call to the same function)
to see if it can find the resource.
Many IDEs will let you load a DLL and inspect its resources interactively.
You can check the dialog template to see whether it is listed as resource 100
or as resource <code>"IDD_BRILLANT"</code>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>You passed the wrong instance handle or dialog ID.
</ul>
<p>
This is a generalization of the previous error.
The dialog template needs to exist in the module you passed,
with the ID or name you passed.
If you pass the wrong module or the wrong name,
then you're not going to find it.
</p>
<p>
An even more generalized version of this error is
the case where you forgot to add the dialog to the
module's resources in the first place.
(Maybe you forgot to add the resource file to your project.)
</p>
<p>
The diagnosis for this case is the same as the
case of the misspelled dialog identifier.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The control refused its creation.
</ul>
<p>
In rare cases, a control may fail its creation
by returning <code>FALSE</code> in response to
the <code>WM_<wbr>NC&shy;CREATE</code> message
or <code>-1</code> in response to the
<code>WM_<wbr>CREATE</code> message.
</p>
<ul>
<li>You passed a bad window handle as the <code>hwnd&shy;Parent</code>.
</ul>
<p>
An invalid parameter will naturally result in the function failing.
This rarely occurs in practice because you should be using the handle
of a window under your control, so it shouldn't be destroyed out
from under you.
</p>
<ul>
<li>There is an error in the dialog template.
</ul>
<p>
I have never seen this occur.
The Resource Compiler is pretty good about
not generating erroneous templates.
</p>
<p>
&sup1; Perhaps the author meant to use
<i>e.g.</i> (<i LANG=la>exempli gratia</i>,
which means "for example") instead of
<i>i.e.</i> (<i LANG=la>id est</i>, which means
"that is"). As written, the comment is saying
that an error in the template is the only reason
that <code>Create&shy;Dialog&shy;Indirect</code>
could have failed, when in fact it is only one
example of a failure.
Getting the two Latin abbreviations confused is not
just a pedantic error;
here, it created genuine confusion and probably
wasted a lot of developers' time.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
