<p>
A customer was having trouble with tree view checkboxes.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=m>
<p>
We have a tree view control in a dialog box.
It is defined like this:
</p>
<pre>
CONTROL "", IDC_TREEVIEW, WC_TREEVIEW,
    TVS_HASBUTTONS | TVS_HASLINES | TVS_LINESATROOT |
    TVS_DISABLEDRAGDROP | TBS_SHOWSELALWAYS |
    TVS_CHECKBOXES | WS_BORDER | WS_HSCROLL | WS_TABSTOP,
    65, 22, 259, 182
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, the
<code>TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code> style is set in the
dialog template.
When the dialog is created, but before it is shown,
we have code that populates the tree.
At that time, we want to set the checked state of some of
the nodes by using the
<code>Tree&shy;View_</code><code>Set&shy;Check&shy;State</code> macro.
If we call
<code>Tree&shy;View_</code><code>Get&shy;Check&shy;State</code>
immediately after setting the checked state,
it reports the checked state correctly.
However, once the tree view finishes rendering,
all of the check boxes are cleared.
</p>
<p>
Curiously, if we hide the dialog box,
then set the check boxes,
and then show the dialog box,
then the check boxes are not reset.
</p>
<p>
Why can't we check the tree view items immediately
upon adding them, but before the dialog is shown
for the first time?
And more importantly, is there a workaround?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The tree view control's handling of the
<code>TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code> style is
quirky.
</p>
<p>
"Quirky" is a polite word for "crazy".
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb760013(VS.85).aspx">
The documentation for the
<code>TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code> style</a>
says
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
If you want to use this style,
you must set the
TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code> style
with
<b>Set&shy;Window&shy;Long</b>
after you create the treeview control,
and before you populate the tree.
Otherwise, the checkboxes might appear unchecked,
depending on timing issues.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sorry.
</p>
<p>
Tree view check boxes were poorly-designed.
But we're stuck with them.
</p>
<p>
The customer confirmed that removing the
<code>TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code> style
from the dialog template and instead applying
the style at run time fixes the problem.
</p>
<p>
The <code>TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code> style
is quirky because it was bolted on rather than
designed in.
We'll spend the next several days exploring its quirks
and trying to come up with a set of best practices
for its use.</p>

		<p>Wow. I&#8217;m reading this post as saying that some programs rely on the fact that they set the flag statically, check some items while creating the tree and *requiresr* that those checks be cleared when first showing up? (So that would explain why it can&#8217;t be fixed.)</p>
<p>Otherwise, the only other explanation I can see is that the checks use data that used to be left uninitialized and contained random bits.</p>

		<p>You never know. The customer submitting the question probably is calling Tree­View_Get­Check­State for debugging. But after reading TheDailyWTF for a few years, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if somebody used the checked boxes as a temporary storage.</p>

		<p>When you&#8217;re dealing with code that is over 20 years old with untold thousands of apps using it, you can never be too careful. People rely on the weirdest things, often by accident. Sometimes they work around an issue in such a way that fixing the issue breaks the workaround.</p>

		<p>&#8230; and presumably tree-view checkboxes aren&#8217;t used enough to justify implementing TVS_CHECKBOXES_DONE_RIGHT.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s harder than that, because you need to know the right time to create the checkboxes. Create them too soon, and you create them before people have finished customizing them. (And you end up creating the wrong kind of check boxes.) We&#8217;ll learn how complicated this is over the next few weeks.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
