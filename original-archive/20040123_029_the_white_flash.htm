<p>If you had a program that didn't process messages for a while, but it needed to be painted for whatever reason (say, somebody uncovered it), Windows would eventually lose patience with you and paint your window white.</p>
<p> Or at least, that's what people would claim. Actually, Windows is painting your window with your class background brush. Since most people use COLOR_WINDOW and since COLOR_WINDOW is white in most color schemes, the end result is a flash of white. </p>
<p> Why paint the window white? Why not just leave it alone? </p>
<p> Well, that's what it used to do, but the result was that the previous contents of the screen would be shown where the window "would be".  So suppose you were looking at Explorer, and then you restored a program that stopped responding. Inside the program's main window would be... a picture of Explorer. And then people would try to double-click on what they thought was Explorer but was really a hung program. </p>
<p> In Windows XP, the behavior for a window that has stopped painting is different. Now, the system captures the pixels of the unresponsive window and just redraws those pixels if the window is unable to draw anything itself. Note, however, that if the system can't capture all of the pixels - say because the window was partially covered - then the parts that it couldn't get are filled in with the class brush. </p>
<p> Which is usually white. </p>

		<p>How about the menu bar? I have VC 6 set to use a real menu (not the &quot;toolbar that looks like a menu&quot; style) and when it hangs* the menu bar turns white. Why is that part of the window bits not saved? </p>
<p>*Not that the IDE hangs, but it blocks for a long time occasionally because it&#8217;s waiting on VSS to do its thing.</p>

		<p>I suspect the hung app code only saves the client area. I don&#8217;t actually know much about how the hung app code works; it&#8217;s not my area.</p>

		<p>Mac OSX does what Windows XP does. Since all windows are double-buffered in OSX, the entire window contents are always visible as they were last painted. To indicate the app is not responding to events, OSX changes the cursor to the infamous &quot;spinning beachball of death.&quot;</p>
<p>Pre-OSX, Macs used cooperative multitasking. So if an app hangs, your whole system is hosed.</p>

		<p>Mike:<br />
<br />This feature is called window ghosting.  Basically what happens is if the window manager decides the window is hung, it will capture the contents of it&#8217;s client area, and create a window on the screen with the class &#8216;ghost&#8217;, with the contents it was able to capture, and the window styles of the original window(in most cases, iirc).  So the window you see on screen when the app is not responding is not actually the app&#8217;s window, just a replacement that will hang around until the thread responsible for that window starts responding again.  The menubar is gone because the fake window does not have a menu, just extra space for it which is painted white.  A disabled menubar would probably cause support problems.</p>
<p>This functionality can be disabled using the call DisableProcessWindowsGhosting(), but it&#8217;s not recommended.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m assuming that under Longhorn and the DCE this will no longer occur, since the entire contents of the window will have been buffered regardless of if it was covered up or not.<br />
<br />You&#8217;ll have to come up with some other notification that an app has hung, perhaps render it with the colours reversed?</p>

		<p>NULL and custom non-solid brush apps turn white too (at least on win2k). I&#8217;d suspect most apps turn white because they use a NULL_BRUSH so their program doesn&#8217;t flicker from WM_ERASEBKGND because they&#8217;re double buffering or they haven&#8217;t taken windows programming 101 yet.</p>

		<p>Any recommendations how to create Mac OS X effect Expose for<br />
<br />my Windows app?</p>
<p> Should I go with MetaFiles or BitMaps? And when to capture<br />
<br />them? WM_ACTIVATE + WA_INACTIVE?</p>
<p> Did anyone try to implement WindowShade in his app on Windows?</p>
<p> I am not trying to create OS skins or any kind of extension to OS, but<br />
<br />would like to have these things as an option only within my<br />
<br />application.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
