<p>There are lots of flight status sites out there. (My favorite is <a href="http://flightaware.com/">FlightAware</a> because it's the geekiest of them.) Many of them will send you email alerts when flight information changes, but <a href="http://hosting.portseattle.org/fids/FlightInfo.aspx"> the one from the Port of Seattle</a> is the only one I know of that will also tell you when the arrival gate and baggage claim carousel number change, which is handy when you're picking up someone at the airport. (Main entry page <a href="http://hosting.portseattle.org/fids/"> here</a>.)</p>
<p> A useful site if you're departing from the airport is the TSA's <a href="http://waittime.tsa.dhs.gov/"> Security Checkpoint Wait Times</a> site, which gives you estimates of wait times based on data collected in the most recent few weeks. </p>
<p> When you arrive at <a href="http://www.portseattle.org/seatac/"> Seattle-Tacoma International Airport</a>, a friendly voice welcomes you via a pre-recorded message. Historically, the voice has been that of the mayor of the city of Seattle, but a few years ago, it changed to that of the President of the Port Commission. I don't know what prompted the change, but I guess some sort of gentleman's agreement fell apart. </p>

		<p>Obviously the President of the Port Commission discovered that the Mayor of Seattle was sleeping with his wife.</p>

		<p>Might depend on who is elected or changed more often, the Mayor or port commission president. Maybe they got tired of re-recording the announcement every four (or whatever number) years?</p>

		<p>Nope, it was because of his slutty wife.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
