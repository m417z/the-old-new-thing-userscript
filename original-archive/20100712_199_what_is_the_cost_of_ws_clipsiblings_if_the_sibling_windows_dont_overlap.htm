<p>Commenter Robert May asks via the Suggestion Box <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#1605533"> whether there is a penalty to pay for using <code>WS_<wbr>CLIP&shy;SIBLINGS</wbr></code> when the sibling windows are not overlapping</a>.</p>
<p> When you use the <code>WS_<wbr>CLIP&shy;SIBLINGS</wbr></code> style, the window manager clips out the portion of the client rectangle that is covered by sibling windows. This is usually desirable behavior; otherwise you end up with two windows trying to paint at the same location, and somebody is likely to get hurt. (<strike>The</strike> One notable exception is in dialog boxes, where some controls like the group box were designed to have other controls drawn on top of them.) </p>
<p> The cost of this flag is that when it comes time to calculate the visible region for a window, the space occupied by sibling windows higher in the z-order are clipped out. This happens even if the sibling windows don't overlap; after all, the only way to find out whether there are any overlapping sibling windows is to enumerate the sibling windows looking for them! Of course, if there is in fact no overlapping, then the calculations are trivial. The only cost was the loop which determines that there are no applicable siblings to be clipped out. </p>

		<p>Some time ago Larry Osterman wrote about fixing a flickering Vista/7 volume control: <a target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2009/09/16/building-a-flicker-free-volume-control.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/building-a-flicker-free-volume-control.aspx</a></p>
<p>Ultimately he went through the pain of writing his own groupbox.</p>
<p>In the comments to that post I suggested: 1) add CLIPSIBLINGS+CLIPCHILDREN to the styles; 2) make sure the group boxes are low in Z-order; and 3) use BeginDeferWindowPos/EndDeferWindowPos.</p>
<p>Do you think that would help? This worked for me in my projects.</p>

		<p>I always liked the way Borlad VCL groupboxes are actually the parent of its controls (This is more work in plain win32 since you have to forward messages and GetDlgItem etc is problematic in the dlgproc)</p>

		<p>Apart from the cost of the enumeration, assuming there ARE overlapping child windows, is there a cost of the resulting extra complexity of the clipping region?</p>
<p>And I guess the most relevant question is, on modern hardware, are any of these &quot;costs&quot; actually noticeable?</p>

		<p>I wonder what the point of this whole post is. Sounds to me like you don&#39;t actually know the answer to the original question. The &quot;cost&quot; is measured in time/performance. It&#39;s like if someone asked you &quot;how much do bananas cost&quot; and you answered &quot;they cost their price per pound multiplied by how many pounds you buy&quot;).</p>

		<p>[Putting the group boxes low in the Z-order breaks keyboard shortcuts. -Raymond]</p>
<p>I don&#39;t quite remember such artifact. In what case it would break the shortcuts?</p>
<p>Oh, and if you want control-specific tooltips, you better *have* groupboxes low in Z order. Or your ChildWindowFromPoint will always return the box instead of one of included buttons. I suspect this will also be required for accessibility.</p>

		<p>[Press the keyboard shortcut for the groupbox and see where focus goes. And for hit-testing, see RealChildWindowFromPoint. -Raymond]</p>
<p>Before I can cobble a test app, I refreshed my memory.</p>
<p>Pressing a keyboard shortcut causes the selected control or the next in Tab-order to get focus.</p>
<p>The tab order follows the order in what the controls are created. In Z-order, the first one created is below all others, and the last one created is on top of others. </p>
<p>This means, if the inner controls of a groupbox are listed immediately after it in the dialog template, they are *above* it in Z-order, and *follow* it in tab order. This also means GetNextDlgTabItem seems to use some equivalent of GetNextWindow(GW_HWNDPREV) for a next child control in tab order. </p>

		<p>Not trying to be negative or anything, but this entry seems like something of a non-statement, and one that the questioner could have guessed. &nbsp;&quot;Is there a cost of looping through sibling windows? &nbsp;Why yes, it&#39;s the cost of enumerating and looping through sibling windows&#8230;&quot; &nbsp;But then, I suppose if there *was* an observable performance hit that actually makes a difference in the questioner&#39;s program, then they wouldn&#39;t have to ask the question, because the hit would be exactly that: observable.</p>

		<p>Don&#39;t all be so negative people.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve read Raymonds post carefully you may have learned something from it.</p>
<p>The cost of using the flag is low, and predictable. No weird stuff happening if windows do not overlap. I find this interesting.</p>

<p>Presumably, it isn&#39;t noticable unless you have thousands of windows with weird clipping regions. Anyway, if you do not clip the siblings, you may end up with more extensive drawing operations, which would probably involve a higher &quot;cost&quot;.</p>

		<p>As I read it you can make the following statements about the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS flag:</p>
<p>1) Yes, there may be a penalty. You get nothing for free.</p>
<p>2) Just enumerating the sibling windows and see if they are overlapping is trivial.</p>
<p>3) Finally computing the overlapped rectangle isn&#39;t that hard but is has to be done.</p>
<p>4) If you are in doubt that your application gets any benefits from clipping out sibling windows you have to make some tests.</p>
<p>The answer to the question for the costs of the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS flag is a clear maybe. It depends on your application. If you have ever written the code for determining overlapped rectangles you get an idea of the costs. My experience says yes its worth clipping sibling windows.</p>

		<p>Now back to WS_CLIBSIBLINGS cost. If cost of calculating the clipping region were any significant, it could be reduced to trivial by precomputing all clipping regions in advance, and only updating that on child window move/resize.</p>
<p>Thus, it&#39;s not worth considering, especially in this age of frigaherz processors.</p>

		<p>@Scott:</p>
<p>Answering &quot;yes&quot; would be one of those answers that is both absolutely true and completely useless. &nbsp;Explaining that the cost is low and the sort of computation that&#39;s happening is far more likely to answer the actual intended question.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
