<p>Puzzle hunts are a popular pastime at Microsoft. For the Microsoft Intern Puzzleday 2007, the puzzle design team decided upon a Harry Potter theme. Competitors ("students") formed teams ("study groups") as they attended classes at the Hogwarts campus at Microsoft. Of course, since this is Harry Potter, you need a magic wand, so the puzzle design team made a bunch of <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/acornwand/"> functional magic wands</a>.</p>
<p> Some members of the puzzle design team had attended <i>Hogwarts and the Draconian Prophecy</i> and came back raving about these amazing magic wands. The wand designer (who goes by the name <i>Acorn</i>) advised the puzzle design team on how to build their own wands, and they ordered custom circuit boards, soldered the components, assembled the plastic enclosures, and programmed the wands to recognize the puzzle spells. </p>
<p> Solving each puzzle revealed a spell in the form of a series of wand motions. The wand itself contained an accelererometer and supporting firmware to recognize the motions and determine which (if any) spell was cast. After performing a spell, you shook the wand back and forth, and the persistence of vision effect permitted the wand to display a short message. (As an added bonus, the puzzle design team added a <a href="http://www.hp-lexicon.org/magic/spells/spells_l.html#lumos"> <i>lumos</i></a> spell which lit the tip of the wand for 30 seconds.) </p>
<p> Pretty neat if you ask me. </p>

		<p>Arthur C Clarke, I think, said something about suficiently advanced technology being indistinguishable from magic. Now you know what he meant.</p>

		<p>I was one of the interns that got to participate in said puzzle game.</p>
<p>The wands were absolutely amazing, and one of my friends still casts lumos to use his as a flashlight.</p>

		<p>That is so cool! &nbsp;If only they had patented, developed, mass produced, and released it around the time of the last Harry Potter blockbuster they&#8217;d be retired and relaxing on a beach now.</p>

		<p>A wand that look&#8217;s like pooh isn&#8217;t likely to be a very big sales success. &nbsp;But then again I might have said the same thing about turgid, derivative childrens literature, and look at Harry Potter.</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>Anyway, everyone knows that REAL magic doesn&#8217;t require a wand. &nbsp;Wands &nbsp;are for illusionists who need a device with which to distract their audience. &nbsp;Not everyone can bag a pretty girl in a skimpy, glittery dress, so somethings a pointy stick just has to do.</p>

		<p>Glad you liked the wand! &nbsp;Just so you know, complete instructions for building your own wand can be found on the website</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.rawbw.com/~acorn/wand/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawbw.com/~acorn/wand/</a></p>
<p>The website also says I may offer kits, which I am still considering, but I haven&#8217;t gotten around to doing it yet (feel free to sign up, but don&#8217;t hold your breath :) ).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
