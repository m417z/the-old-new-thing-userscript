		<p>The clue is in the phrase &quot;have to&quot;. &nbsp;Users don&#8217;t like being forced to do something. &nbsp;Whether you respond by reverting the change or justifying the decision is up to your priorities.</p>

		<p>@Mark:</p>
<p>You&#8217;re assuming that there&#8217;s a problem and reverting the change or justification of the change are resolutions.</p>
<p>The question requires more information whereas if the person had stated their question explicitly it wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>What if this statement was intended as a compliment (we used to have to do this, but now it&#8217;s much more intuitive).</p>

		<p>I can relate to this feeling, but I agree with Mark. &nbsp;&quot;Now you have to&#8230;&quot; usually hints that the person is not happy with the change.</p>
<p>In situations like this I would, by default, &nbsp;explain why the change was made and ask back if the change was causing problems. Sometimes people need someone &quot;help&quot; to steer their own questions.</p>
<p>Good communication is a two way street.</p>

		<ul>
<li>&quot;I have to type my password every time I open Outlook.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;d just respond: &quot;Yes you do.&quot;</p>
<p>Hopefully they realize they need to elaborate on the problem. Although sometimes they never respond. Maybe they just think &quot;OK, so I can&#8217;t get around the problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Honestly though, it&#8217;s like &quot;Don&#8217;t forget to ask the question.&quot; If you send a question, that requires a reply. If you send me a statement, it does not require a reply. Usually I take a statement to be the end of the conversation. This is a problem when it&#8217;s the first email in the conversation (and isn&#8217;t intended as a memo).</p>

		<p>Sort of reminds me of this:</p>
<p>&quot;If you donâ€™t specify what you expected to see, I may not understand why this is a bug. The splash screen has blood on it. So what? I cut my fingers when I was coding it. What did you expect? Ah, you say that the spec required no blood! Now I understand why you consider this a bug.&quot;</p>

		<p>User: &quot;Blah is broken.&quot;</p>
<p>me: &quot;What exactly is it doing that&#8217;s not what you expected?&quot;</p>
<p>Something along those lines usually works in that simple of a situation. &nbsp;Of course, there&#8217;s also a presumption that I&#8217;m in any position to care (such as random rants about politics vs. issues with computer systems under my control).</p>

		<p>Erzengel: so if someone emails you &quot;my clothes are on fire&quot;, you ignore it because there&#8217;s no question?</p>

		<p>Mark: If somebody emailed me to tell me that their clothes were on fire, what could they possibly want me to do? Run over and extinguish them? Laugh? Commiserate? Tell them to call the fire department? Give them advice on how to put the fire out?</p>
<p>Those are all valid responses, and it&#8217;s hard to know what they want, particularly if I don&#8217;t know them.</p>

		<p>Mark:</p>
<p>No, like I said: I usually take a statement to be the end of a conversation. This causes issues when it is the first email in a conversation. When it is the first email in a conversation and all I recieve is a statement, I usually reply with the most obvious course of action.</p>
<p>Him: &quot;My clothes are on fire.&quot;</p>
<p>Me: &quot;There&#8217;s a red lever on the wall that says &#8216;pull in case of fire&#8217;.&quot;</p>
<p>Like Gabe says, you&#8217;re really thinking, &quot;OK, that&#8217;s great. Should I point and laugh? Run over and put you out? Call 911? What?&quot;</p>
<p>I would usually expect &quot;My clothes are on fire&quot; to follow my own E-Mail to someone requesting they do something they don&#8217;t want to do: &quot;Sorry, can&#8217;t. My clothes are on fire, gotta put it out.&quot; Statement: End of Conversation (Attempted).</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s an &quot;actionable&quot; statement, such as, &quot;When outlook opens I need to enter a password. I should be able to enter it once and let the computer remember the password.&quot;, then it&#8217;s a different story. There&#8217;s an implied, &quot;Can you fix this?&quot; in the statement. But without it, there&#8217;s just issues with &quot;what do you want me to do about it?&quot;</p>

		<p>Stephen Jones:</p>
<p>I consider myself a &quot;normal&quot; person, and I don&#8217;t think that the email in question contains enough information to make anything more than an educated guess as to what the user wants.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a very good guess; I&#8217;d give it a 99% probability that the user wants to do task Q the old way. But there&#8217;s still a 1% chance that the user understands that task Q is a sensitive task, so UAC now pops up when you attempt it, or realizes that menu AA disappeared, so task Q had to move, or whatever else could have happened, and they&#8217;re just bitching to Raymond because he&#8217;s a convenient target. (Especially because everyone thinks Raymond wrote all of Windows, so they complain to him about IE issues, or localization issues, or tell him &quot;Vista is crap&quot;, etc.)</p>
<p>Who knows? Maybe they&#8217;re baiting him, so he displays his social skills of a thermonuclear device, and they get to brag to all their friends.</p>

		<p>I think there&#8217;s also an implicit &quot;from people who should know better&quot; in there. If a client tells me &quot;X isn&#8217;t right,&quot; I know I&#8217;m going to draw the actual problem out of them over the course of an afternoon despite my best efforts to train them otherwise.</p>
<p>For what I&#8217;d assume to be a mailing to a dev team there&#8217;s a much higher bar, even if you&#8217;re non-programming management: Don&#8217;t just whine, tell me what you want.</p>
<p>One of my clients would get back something like, &quot;Yes, we changed A-B to X-Y because of Z. We thought that because of JKL it would be easier this way. Are people over there not liking it/preferring the old way?&quot;</p>
<p>A fellow programmer (who should know better) would get, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Preemptive pre-snarky comment: I almost typed &quot;because of 123 it would be easier&#8230;&quot; above. Then I realized that nothing is ever easier with 1-2-3.</p>

		<p>Also, Bob, if you&#8217;ve been to the suggestion box then you&#8217;ll have read this:</p>
<p>&quot;Note the enormous topic backlog. Consequently, the suggestion box has been closed temporarily and will reopen once the existing backlog has cleared, which I estimate will happen sometime in early 2010. If your suggestion is that important, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll remember it when the suggestion box reopens.&quot;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
