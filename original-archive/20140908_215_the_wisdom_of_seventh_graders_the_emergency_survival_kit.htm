<p>As a precursor to reading a story about survival, seventh grade students were asked to come up with a list of things they would want to have in their emergency survival kit. Students were specifically instructed to limit themselves to things that were readily available (so no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AH-64_Apache"> Apache helicopters</a>), and the complete kit had to be something you could comfortably carry in a student backpack.</p>
<p> As always, there are students who chose a very sensible collection of things to put in their emergency survival kit: water purification tablets, a flashlight (with batteries), a first-aid kit. Those students are not the subject of today's story. </p>
<p> Here are some of the more unusual items some students chose to put in their emergency survival kit: </p>
<ul>
<li>Fifty     <a href="http://www.babybites.info/2010/03/03/1-year-happy-meal/">     cheeseburgers</a>. </li>
<li>Moisturizer. </li>
<li>Colored pencils. </li>
<li>A puppy. </li>
<li>Fifty gallons of water. (Must be a strong kid with a really big backpack.) </li>
<li>A Gameboy. </li>
<li>Five     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuriken">     throwing stars</a>. </li>
<li>Jell-O. Because     <a href="http://www.jellogallery.org/">     there's always room for Jell-O</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p> September is <a href="http://www.ready.gov/"> National Preparedness Month</a>. </p>

		<p>The one that confounds me is the puppy. Is it like the colored pencils and the Gameboy, so you have something to play with? Presumably it wasn&#39;t the intention to use the puppy as a hunting dog. Or food, for that matter&#8230; The puppy does meet the criterion of fitting in a backpack, although presumably you wouldn&#39;t actually leave it there.</p>
<p>My emergency survival kit just contains my tablet. Not the water purification kind, the electronic kind. With it I can contact the outside world for help and browse the Internet while waiting for said help. Of course, I might end up somewhere where there&#39;s no reception for a mobile network, but in that case, life has surely stopped being worthwhile anyway. I shall read the remainder of my e-books and go quietly into that good night.</p>

		<p>This list doesn&#39;t surprise me at all. It&#39;s a result of the (civilized) world we&#39;re living in today. We&#39;re at such an advanced technological level that we don&#39;t care for basic knowledge like how to survive without a grocery store or how to make a fire without a match or lighter. Knowledge that was established over thousands of years, it&#39;s getting more and more forgotten because we think we don&#39;t need it anymore, and therefore assume it&#39;s no longer important to teach to our kids. We depend on technology, our gadgets, McD, and 24/7 instead. Who needs purification tablets or a knife in the backback?</p>
<p>I&#39;m not that old but I still remember the time when I went to school during the mid-90s and there were no cell phones and the web was just about to take-off. Now when a look at people today, I&#39;m a bit surprised (sometimes shocked) tell me they couldn&#39;t manage to live without their phone or the internet for one day or a week. Gosh, I don&#39;t wanna know the hell that would brake loose if there were no GPS or network for 24h.</p>

		<p>I&#39;d be happy to blame the water thing on not using the metric system. &nbsp;When you do use the metric system it is trivial to convert water into volumes/dimensions and weights (all involve multiples of 10). &nbsp;The backward system used in the US (and one other country) makes it way harder.</p>

		<p>@sevenacids: Teaching kids isn&#39;t free. Time is limited. If you want to teach them how to survive in the wilderness, then you&#39;re going to have to sacrifice something less important instead. So what are kids learning today that&#39;s less important to their happiness and well-being than wilderness survival?</p>
<p>@Roger: The imperial system does a pretty good job making it trivial to convert gallons to volume, in my opinion.</p>

		<p>Roger: 1 gallon of water weighs 8 pounds. &quot;A pint&#39;s a pound the world around.&quot; An ounce of water takes up one fluid ounce of volume. It has everything to do with a kid thinking a tap is infinite and not thinking of putting 50 milk jugs into his backpack.</p>

<p>Given how many people ended up calling emergency services after FaceBook had an outage, that is *barely* satire&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Dave Liney: Actually the phrase used to be accurate. Prior to 1824, England had a &quot;wine gallon&quot; that was equal to today&#39;s US Gallon (which is the gallon used on the American continents).</p>

		<p>I wonder why there&#39;s no chocolate / snack bar in the list. It&#39;s a valid choice of emergency food that provides you energy to perform whatever survival task you&#39;re facing.</p>
<p>I guess kids in these days are taught not to eat sweet food.</p>
<p>Some generic drugs like aspirin pills would be helpful in case you may have difficulty to find a doctor in serious disaster. If you got hurt badly on the way to escape, fever can kill.</p>

		<p>Also, I wonder if they still teach people to put plastic sheets in their survival kit. Plastic sheets are very useful in surviving a in the wild.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
