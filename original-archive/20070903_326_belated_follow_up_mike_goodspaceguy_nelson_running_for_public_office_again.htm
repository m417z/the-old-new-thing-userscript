<p>Undeterred by his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/09/20/763728.aspx"> failure to win a Senate seat last year</a>, Mike Goodspaceguy Nelson once again <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003832735_kingcouncileight12m.html"> ran for King County Council</a>. I can't bring myself to listen to <a href="http://www.kuow.org/defaultProgram.asp?ID=13107"> his appearance on the local public radio station</a> (fortunately, he wasn't running in my district). You can <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/elections/pamphlet/pamphlet.aspx?cid=23008&amp;eid=1219"> read his and opponent Dow Constantine's candidate statements</a> on the King County Elections Web site.</p>
<p> I stumbled across a candidate questionnaire that the <a href="http://www.historicseattle.org/"> Historic Seattle Preservation Foundation</a> submitted to all of the candidates for King County City Council, and comparing <a href="http://www.historicseattle.org/advocacy/2007primary/2007kcc_gn.aspx"> Michael Goodspaceguy Nelson's response</a> with <a href="http://www.historicseattle.org/advocacy/2007primary/2007kcc_dc.aspx"> the response from mainstream candidates Dow Constantine</a> and <a href="http://www.historicseattle.org/advocacy/2007primary/2007kcc_jh.aspx"> Jane Hague</a>, I have to say that Nelson comes off looking pretty good. He answers each question honestly, assigning medium or even low priority to the historic society's hot-button issues, describing how they fit into his overall plan. By comparison, Constantine and Hague pander to the foundation by rating everything as high priority. The sole "medium priority" was their assessment of how the council as a whole prioritized an issue. "See? I pander to you better than the rest of the council!" </p>
<p> (Note: This message was pre-recorded. The race was no contest; Constantine won easily.) </p>
<p> In other local election news, the race for another seat on the King County council has been suffering a series of bizarre twists. The incumbent Jane Hague <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003849270_haguepolitics23m.html"> was arrested for drunk driving back in June</a>, and the news was kept quiet until just days before the election, at which point local politics were thrown into a tizzy. </p>
<p> But wait, there's more. You'd think the opposition party would be ecstatic, but they were too busy dealing with their own problems to care, for the opposition candidate was perennial also-ran Richard Pope. ("<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/326476_pope06.html">Some people go to baseball games or go fishing. Richard files for office</a>.") </p>
<p> How did a fringe candidate become the opposition candidate? State law permits candidates to claim whatever party affiliation they wish, without needing permission from the party itself, and Pope has taken advantage of this, changing parties three times during his career. (I'm simplifying; <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/328718_election23.html"> read the story for details</a>.) </p>
<p> So now we have a choice in November between an accused drunk and a fringe candidate. It's going to be a weird election. </p>

		<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;So now we have a choice in November between an accused drunk and a fringe candidate. It&#8217;s going to be a weird election.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
<p>Do you know the &lt;i&gt;South Park&lt;/i&gt; episode where they have to change the mascot for the school team ? &nbsp;They&#8217;re attacked by PETA for using an animal, and the kids have to vote on the new one, a runoff between a douche and a turd sandwich. &nbsp;When Stan complains about this to an adult, the adult says well, that&#8217;s how it always is, in elections: you always have to choose between a douche and a turd.</p>
<p>This might not be quite that way, but the &lt;i&gt;South Park&lt;/i&gt; thing resonates nonetheless.</p>

		<p>I like how on the latest entry on his blog (or should I say, one of his blogs, <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://colonizespace.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://colonizespace.blogspot.com</a>), he says not once but twice:</p>
<p>&quot;Please keep campaign contributions under $ 25 per contributor. Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, I don&#8217;t think anyone will have any problem following that request&#8230;.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
