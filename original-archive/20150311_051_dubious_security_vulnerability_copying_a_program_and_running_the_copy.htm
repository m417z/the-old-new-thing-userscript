<p>This wasn't an actual security vulnerability report, but it was inspired by one. "If you take the program <code>XYZ.EXE</code> and you rename it or copy it to a new name that contains the letters <code>XYX</code>, then you can trigger a buffer overflow in the renamed/copied version of <code>XYZ.EXE</code> due to a bug in the way it parses its own file name in order to generate the names of its auxiliary files."</p>
<p> While that's a bug, and thanks for pointing it out, it is not a security issue because there is no elevation of privilege. Sure, you could rename or copy the program and run it, but if you have permission to do that, you may as well do it the easy way: Instead of copying <code>XYZ.EXE</code> and running it, just copy <code>pwnz0rd.exe</code> and run it! Either way, it's just a case of you attacking yourself. You did not gain any privileges. </p>
<p> Renaming or copying a file requires <code>FILE_<wbr>ADD_<wbr>FILE</wbr></wbr></code> permission in the destination directory, and if you have permission to add files to a directory, why stop at just adding files that are copies of existing files? You can add entirely new files! </p>
<p> In other words, instead of <code>copy XYZ.EXE XYX.EXE</code>, just do <code>copy pwnz0rd.exe XYX.EXE</code>. </p>
<p> This is a variation of the dubious vulnerability known as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/07/4268706.aspx#4282521"> <i>Code execution results in code execution</i></a>. </p>
<p> Now, this would be an actual vulnerability if you could somehow redirect attempts by other people to run <code>XYZ.EXE</code> from the original to your alternate <code>XYX.EXE</code> instead. But that would be attacking the redirection code, not attacking <code>XYZ.EXE</code> itself. Because if you can fool somebody into running <code>XYX.EXE</code> instead of <code>XYZ.EXE</code>, then you may as well fool them into running <code>pwnz0rd.exe</code>. It's not like the <code>Create&shy;Process</code> function performs a hard drive scan looking for a program whose name is similar to the one you requested and running that other program instead. </p>

		<p>The easiest way to eliminate security vulnerabilities is to eliminate the digital computer, OS, and applications all together. The Fire Control system on the USS North Carolina used a totally analog computing solution. You protect privelege elevation by protecting physical access, and a guard with rifle is pretty effective.</p>

		<p>@Brian, you remind me of a quote saying something like the most secure system being unusable. Couldn&#39;t find that one after a quick search, but did find this one from Gene Spafford:</p>
<p>&quot;The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards &#8211; and even then I have my doubts.&quot;</p>

		<p>As Joshua said, this could be a vulnerability if the administrator has enabled application whitelisting of one form or another, if the whitelisting is done by signatures or fingerprints. &nbsp;It&#39;s a way to make a whitelisted program do something unexpected.</p>

		<p>I agree with Adam and Joshua here. &nbsp;It depends on the definition of &quot;privilege&quot;. &nbsp;If code signing is a security boundary, then this is a security exploit.</p>
<p>It&#39;s like my exploit with PowerShell to load unsigned native code DLLs on Windows RT. &nbsp;My exploit is definitely a case of &quot;code execution results in code execution&quot;, yet it&#39;s clearly breaking a boundary: that only Microsoft-signed code is allowed to run in desktop mode on Windows RT.</p>

		<p>I can think of a case that where it might lead to problem.</p>
<p>Say when XYZ.EXE has a function that download update from whatever location to local folder (it ought to be data file only and the code verify the filenames does not end with EXE), they can actually trigger the bug by placing XYZ&lt;whatever&gt;.DAT on the server. But suppose there are some way to trigger arbitrary code execution using the buffer overflow bug&#8230;</p>
<p>Okay, maybe I&#39;m thinking too much.</p>

		<p>I think you are thinking too much :) &nbsp;You said suppose xyz has a function that will execute arbitrary code when tickled the wrong way (in particular, when invoked under a different name). &nbsp;The point Raymond is trying to make is that you have to make a copy of it to tickle it, so you already have the power to execute arbitrary code. &nbsp;Or am I misunderstanding your question?</p>

		<p>I&#39;m saying that XYZ.EXE itself will download some data files from the website. The XYZ.EXE itself is not changed. The XYZ.EXE places files like XYZ&lt;whatever&gt;.DAT to current folder, and it triggered the buffer overflow problem mentioned in the post. Now if the &lt;whatever&gt; part contains bytes that are runnable, and of you know the overflowed part is on some code path that will be triggered routinely, you might successfully trick the XYZ.EXE to run the code bytes you injected.</p>
<p>Of course with NX like technology the possibility of going wrong this way is very small, but consider NX is opt-in by default on Win7 or so I&#39;m not so certain.</p>

		<p>What about creating a hard link with another name to the file? Would that work, or do hard links require special permissions as well?</p>
<p>If hard links require admin: Could you have another device (like an external USB drive) prepared on another computer where you have admin rights and that device would contain the hard link to the file?</p>

		<p>[But how do you trigger the overflow? ]</p>
<p>That&#39;s why I say &quot;[strike]of[/strike]if you know the overflowed part is on some code path that will be triggered routinely&quot;. I don&#39;t know XYZ.EXE&#39;s nature. If it&#39;s a common application that will be run from time to time (like Notepad++), you can be certain that some day it will be run by some user.</p>
<p>If XYZ.exe is not part of a larger package like Office, the existance if the EXE itself is self-evident that it will be run by some user some day.</p>
<p>Now if the attacker can compromise your system by pwning some web server that&#39;s know not to be used to store program updates, I&#39;d count that as security vulnerability.</p>

		<p>So if you have a means to remotely copy a file to a name that you control and then invoke that program, then it&#39;s a security vulnerability. If you can put arbitrary bits on the disk and run them as a program, then it&#39;s no big deal.</p>

<p>A malicous program that is already running in user space but wants admin could do this. Users would just see the &quot;XYZ.EXE asks for elevation&quot; prompt, with XYZ.EXE being a program they know and properly signed by Microsoft, so they think it&#39;s alright and grant permission. It wouldn&#39;t be a code execution bug but still a potential privilege escalation vulnerability.</p>

		<p>If I can get someone to take a pill that I hand to him (that is, eat a capsule of unknown medicine), it doesn&#39;t matter that I have camouflaged the pill by painting it another color, or if I tell him it&#39;s aspirin, or what brand markings I paint on it. &nbsp;(Plus, I hate analogies.)</p>

		<p>I was wondering if there was a way to trip the problem via shortcut resolution (making the original disappear is in fact not unfeasible) but it turns out if you can get the tampered one to run, the only reason to use the original bits is trying to overcome white-listing by signature or hash.</p>
<p>I think both Raymond and I are amazed at the difficulty in comprehending this.</p>
<p>Incidentally the path involved in getting the shortcut resolver to fall for it is straight into dubious security vulnerability territory. I suspect it&#39;s akin to having a world-writable location far down the list in PATH.</p>

		<p>@Coward: Then the elevation prompt will be &quot;XYZ.EXE asks for elevation. Publisher: NOT TRUSTED&quot;. But using that vulnerability and injecting code into the executable of a trusted vendor, you can make it &quot;XYZ.EXE asks for elevation. Publisher: Trusted Vendor (signed)&quot;.</p>

		<p>&quot;even then it&#39;s a fool of a sysadmin who turns on the setuid bit on any binary not designed for it.&quot; &#8211; something can be designed for it but still have a bug.</p>

		<p>Also, does Windows itself (without using cygwin or SFU or anything) not have a functionality equivalent to the setuid bit?</p>

		<p>The converse of this is that &quot;updater can replace &#39;z&#39; with &#39;x&#39; when making a copy&quot; goes from a silly bug to a security vulnerability.</p>

		<p>@Random832 &quot;Also, does Windows itself (without using cygwin or SFU or anything) not have a functionality equivalent to the setuid bit&quot;</p>
<p>No it does not have something like setuid.</p>
<p>The only thing that comes near is an application that prompts via UAC for performing an administrative action. But this is only effective, if the user is a member of the Administrators group and if UAC is enabled at all.</p>
<p>If the application does not use UAC for elevation, but is not run by an administrator, the action is denied up-front. If the application is using UAC for elevation, either the user is prompted to enter the credentials of an Administrator account, or he is prompted to confirm that he allows the action. (Problem is, that it is not clear WHAT action the application will really do.)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
