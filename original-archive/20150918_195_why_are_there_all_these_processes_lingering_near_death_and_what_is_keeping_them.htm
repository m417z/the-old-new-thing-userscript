</pre>
<p>
This got me curious:
Why are there so many of these near-death processes,
and what could be keeping them alive?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I'll let you puzzle on this for a little bit.
But you already know the answer.
</p>
<p>
(Waiting.)
</p>
<p>
(Waiting.)
</p>
<p>
Okay.
</p>
<p>
First thing you should observe is that this process
is not actually alive.
It has already exited.
"No active threads."
The one thread that is still associated with the process
has terminated.
</p>
<p>
Why would you have a terminated thread hanging around
inside a terminated process?
</p>
<p>
Because there is still an outstanding handle to the thread.
</p>
<p>
Even though the thread has exited,
the thread object can't go away until all handles to it have
been closed.
</p>
<p>
Now, when you create a process with the
<code>Create&shy;Process</code> function,
you get a
<code>PROCESS_<wbr>INFORMATION</code> structure back
which contains four pieces of information:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A handle to the created process.
<li>A handle to the initial thread in the process.
<li>The ID of the created process.
<li>The ID of the initial thread in the process.
</ol>
<p>
Of those things,
you are probably interested in the process handle,
because that's the thing you can wait on
to learn when the process has exited.
And you probably ignore the thread handle.
</p>
<p>
Oops.
</p>
<p>
You need to close the thread handle,
or the thread cannot go away.
It may have stopped executing,
but the fact that you have a handle to it
means that you can still do things like
check if the thread has exited
(yes, already!),
ask for the exit code,
ask for the thread ID,
ask how much CPU the thread consumed during its lifetime,
and so on,
and all those statistics are kept in the thread object.
And since thread and process IDs need to
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/01/07/10112755.aspx">
remain unique as long as there is still a handle to the object</a>,
the object needs to hang around so that it "occupies space"
so that no other thread can grab its ID.
</p>
<p>
The customer
called this process <i>near death</i>,
but the more conventional term for it is
<i>zombie</i>.
In fact, zombie isn't a good term either,
because this process and this thread are well
and truly dead,
never to walk again.
</p>
<p>
A better name would be <i>corpse</i>.
The process and thread are dead.
They're just lying there,
rotting away in memory,
waiting for all references to be released
so they can disappear entirely.
</p>
<p>
Since the customer liaison said that
the customer has
"a complicated system where they create
and kill processes",
it's entirely possible that somewhere in the complicated
system,
somebody loses track of the thread handle,
causing it to leak.
It also calls into question whether they need
this complicated system at all.
Maybe their complicated system exists to work
around some other problem,
and we should be trying to solve that other problem.
</p>
<p>
Just for completeness,
another possibility for the thread lying dead
in the process is that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/23/192531.aspx">
some kernel driver has taken a reference to the thread
and has gotten stuck</a>.
</p>
<p>
We left the customer liaison with that information.
We didn't hear back,
so either our guess about thread handles was correct,
or the customer decided we weren't being helpful enough and decided
to stop talking to us.</p>

		<p>Why do I get the feeling a whole lot of customer issues end up closed because &quot;[the] decided we weren&#39;t beling helpful enough and decided to stop talking to us. &quot; mainly because the customer had a whole lot invested already in their VERY wrong approach ?</p>

		<p>Looking at the information provided, what I can see happening is something like a service is running an executable to do some work, and then it exits. The thing that also strikes me as important is that the executable only seems to run for around 2 seconds.</p>
<p>So what I wonder is, could this be a service that runs a program to do stuff on behalf of a user, rather than using impersonation?</p>

		<p>It&#39;s interesting to see that the corpse isn&#39;t completely rotted away. Does anybody know what those 5 pages in the process working set are for?</p>
<p>Darran Rowe: The process uses 2 seconds of CPU time, but that doesn&#39;t mean it only ran for 2 seconds. It could have run for a whole day, mostly waiting and doing I/O, and still only have 2 seconds of CPU time accumulated.</p>

		<p>Windows NT&#39;s process system is *so* much better than UNIX&#39;s in this regard. &nbsp;In Linux, for example, it is not possible for you to wait for a process that you did not fork()/posix_spawn() yourself to finish. &nbsp;It makes process management really painful in Linux.</p>

		<p>&quot;No active threads&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s not limited to leaked thread handles or driver references&#8230;</p>
<p>When a process crashes on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 &#8211; Windows Error Reporting will create a &#39;reflected&#39; process with absolutely zero threads; If you open a process handle to that &#39;zero thread process&#39; and call the TerminateProcess function; You&#39;ll get a Blue Screen of Death.</p>
<p>Hopefully that customers &quot;complicated system where they create and kill processes&quot; doesn&#39;t attempt to terminate those type of processes.</p>

		<p>So how can one test if a given PID corresponds to a zombie process or a still running process? A second OpenProcess() on such a zombie process will succeed! One could try to WaitForSingleObject() on the given HANDLE, but it will return with WAIT_FAILED and GetLastError() == ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED =&gt; this doesn&#39;t seem to be conclusive and could happen for a regular process, too, maybe if we&#39;re lacking access rights.</p>

		<p>@Dango: It&#39;s specific to Zombie Process if you opened the handle with the right access bits. Access is only checked in the OpenProcess() call.</p>

		<p>Darran Rowe: If you really meant CPU time, why is it important that the process only used 2 seconds of CPU? The computer I&#39;m sitting at claims an up time of over 10 days and about half of the 100-or-so processes show a CPU time of 2 seconds or less.</p>
<p>Those processes include the likes of csrss, smss, wininit, winlogon, and the print spooler; so I don&#39;t see what is implied by having used only 2 seconds of CPU.</p>

		<p>@Gabe:</p>
<p>OK, I will explain everything in detail. But the entire thing was just hypothesising over the scraps of information, it isn&#39;t any kind of remarkable life changing idea. One possible thought on what things with processes they could be doing to get to this state.</p>
<p>First there is the fact that it is not just the process with 2 seconds of CPU time, but there are hundreds of them in this near death state with two seconds of CPU time.</p>
<p>Second, the process is in session 0, this is the session that services live in. If a service executes a process, then I&#39;m certain that it also runs in session 0 unless the token is modified to run in another session. (Assuming post XP and 2k3, but since it is a 64 bit system, and the popularity of 64 bit server versions of Windows have increased over time, I don&#39;t think that is too bad of an assumption).</p>
<p>Third, with the fact that there are so many processes with leaked handles, this hints more at the processes being short lived worker processes. If they were long lived, then you wouldn&#39;t end up with hundreds of them.</p>
<p>With those bits of information, the thought was instead of using impersonation in the service, maybe because of threading reasons, they spin up a new process with CreateProcessAsUser. If you already have the work you want done in an existing application, it would be easier to just execute this instead of creating a new thread to do the work on. Depending on how good the developers are, it may have just been easier to write this work into a new application instead of dealing with the threading issues anyway.</p>
<p>So that was more of the thought process which lead to that huge waste of time.</p>

		<p>&quot;So how can one test if a given PID corresponds to a zombie process or a still running process?&quot;</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, I think you can ask for the process&#39;s exit code. If it is still running, you&#39;ll get an error to say there&#39;s no exit code yet.</p>

		<p>As far as I recall a zombie process has a thread count of zero. If you find a process with zero threads you can be sure that it is a zombie process. If you want to detect a crashed or zombified process you need also to check if it has all threads suspended except for one thread which is right now dumping the process. Things become more complicated if the process beeing checked is a managed process where you need to differntiate between a garbage collection and a memory dump operation.</p>

		<p>/*Myria: Windows NT&#39;s process system is *so* much better than UNIX&#39;s in this regard.*/</p>
<p>Windows NT kernel is much better than most of UNIXes at all &#8211; its much more logical and even aesthetically beautiful.. However the biggest problem with everything beautiful is that when some its part become corrupted the whole thing becomes ugly. But when entropy&#39;s corruption touches system that is not initally designed by strict rules from bottom to top &#8211; almost nothing visually changes&#8230;</p>

		<p>I think the conventional term for this kind of process is &quot;defunct&quot; process. It&#39;s been more verbose in the *nix world because the &quot;ps&quot; command will mark these process that has been exited but still exist solely because the parent process is monitoring it with &quot;&lt;defunct&gt;&quot;.</p>

		<p>@cheong00 : Note that the &#39;ps&#39; manual page (at least on this Debian based system says: </p>
<p>&quot;Processes marked &lt;defunct&gt; are dead processes (so-called &quot;zombies&quot;) that remain because their parent has not destroyed them properly.&quot;</p>

		<p>I would think that the term &quot;zombie&quot; would apply to David Crowell&#39;s hypothetical process that has exited, but where somebody called CreateRemoteThread on it to bring it back to life.</p>

		<p>IMHO windows developers took care to avoid zombie apocalypse. Such attempt likely will fail with STATUS_PROCESS_IS_TERMINATING. </p>

		<p>Stupid question: Is this statement &quot;via their customer liaison&quot; of any importance? After so long following your blog, it looks like you always offer all the required information for the post, but rarely something useless. So, what&#39;s the story behind it? I&#39;ve noticed it for some time now.</p>

		<p>&mdash; &quot;It also calls into question whether they need this complicated system at all. Maybe their complicated system exists to work around some other problem, and we should be trying to solve that other problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Tell that to the Internet Explorer team. They do it. Oh, wait. Internet Explorer is dead. Okay, you can tell that to the Google Chrome team. Or the Firefox team.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I don&#39;t think the system used by browsers is all that complicated, and my guess is that they don&#39;t TerminateProcess as the primary lifetime management mechanism. Also, I did say &quot;maybe&quot;. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>&#39;Is this statement &quot;via their customer liaison&quot; of any importance?&#39;</p>
<p>Yes, it means that Raymond didn&#39;t have direct contact with the customer, all information from and back to the customer was being filtered by someone.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
