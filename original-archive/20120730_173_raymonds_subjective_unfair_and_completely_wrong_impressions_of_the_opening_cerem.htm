<p>Like many other people, I watched the opening ceremonies of a major athletic event which took place a few days ago. (The organization responsible for the event has taken the step of <a href="http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/voldemort.html"> blocking the mention</a> of <a href="http://www.london2012.com/about-us/our-brand/using-the-brand/#what%20are%20protected%20games%20marks"> the name of the city hosting the event and the year the event takes place, or the name of the event itself</a> except in editorial news pieces or journalistic statements of fact, of which this is neither, so I will endeavour to steer clear of the protected marks.)</p>
<p> I wish somebody had let me know in advance that the opening ceremonies came with a reading list. I hope that at least the British history majors enjoyed it. </p>
<p> NBC, the media organization which obtained the rights to broadcast the event in the United States, explained that they were not streaming the opening or closing ceremonies live because they "do not translate well online because they require context, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-olympics-nbc-defends-blackout-20120727,0,6531230.story"> which our award-winning production team will provide</a>." And now we learned what sort of contextualization their award-winning production team provided: For Tim Berners-Lee, their valuable context was, "I don't know who that guy is." (<i>The Guardian</i> provides <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/28/pass-notes-olympics-tim-berners-lee"> a snarky backgrounder</a>.) </p>
<p> During the entry of the various national teams, the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/08/20/10052301.aspx"> standard activity</a> is to make fun of their outfits. </p>
<p> Dear <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/olympic-opening-ceremony-photos-most-bizarre-moment-goes-to-czech-republic"> Czech Republic</a>: Spandex shorts and blue rain galoshes? It's as if you're <i>trying</i> to look hideous. </p>
<p> Dear <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1275750-olympic-opening-ceremony-2012-the-17-worst-outfits-of-the-night/page/10"> Germany</a>: Wha??? I'm speechless. </p>
<p> Dear <a href="http://www.eonline.com/photos/5749/fashion-police-2012-olympics-opening-ceremony/206358"> United States of America</a>: I hope you enjoy your shore leave. (Somebody seriously has a navy fetish going on.) </p>
<p> Dear  <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1275750-olympic-opening-ceremony-2012-the-17-worst-outfits-of-the-night/page/16"> Sweden</a>: I know it's late, but you're not supposed to wear your jammy-jams to the opening ceremony. <i lang="se">Jag s&auml;ger bara...</i> </p>
<p> Dear <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1275750-olympic-opening-ceremony-2012-the-17-worst-outfits-of-the-night/page/18"> gracious hosts</a>: Oh, now I get it. It's the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. But still, you could've chosen a better tribute than wearing dresses from 1912. </p>

		<p>Of all the issues with the event that shall not be named I think the most egregious is NBC&#39;s refusal to air things live. &nbsp;I mean seriously, LOLWUT? &nbsp;A global event (that SHALL NOT BE NAMED) has the world&#39;s attention and we learn about the results from news broadcasts BEFORE the event (that SHALL NOT BE NAMED) is shown? &nbsp;My God, it&#39;s full of fail!</p>

		<p>It was aired live in Israel, and the broadcasters were just as bad. They were reading from the sheets, but half the time they were wrong because they either read a line that wasn&#39;t supposed to be read yet, or one that had already happened half an hour ago&#8230;</p>

		<p>It&#39;s not clear to me why this isn&#39;t both an editorial news piece and a series of journalistic statements of fact, but I can see why you wouldn&#39;t want to bother your lawyer with this. I really do wish they would stop with the commercialization that steps on people&#39;s ability to act normally. For another example: I heard that, in the nameless city, no-one except the fast food chain that had paid for the official sponsorship of the games is allowed to sell anything resembling french fries except as part of a &#39;fish and chips&#39; combination &#8211; and the last bit was a last-minute compromise due to public outrage.</p>

		<p>Well, I live in the host country for the event that shall not be named, and at least our presenters were doing a lot better. Of course, since it is our own history and stuff, it would be a sad day if they didn&#39;t know that.</p>

		<p>The reason that NBC is refusing to air certain things live is simple: money. &nbsp;They get far more ad revenue by selling ads in prime time slots for popular events that people want to watch than they would if they aired those events during morning/afternoon hours and sold ads for those time slots instead. &nbsp;When the choice comes down to giving the people what they want or making more money, what do you think a big corporation is going to do?</p>

		<p>Is your avoidance of the protected marks a satirical comment, or simply a way to stay out of trouble? Just asking out of interest; after all, I don&#39;t want you to get into trouble because I typed London, do I?</p>

		<p>NBC, through its much maligned streaming and tape-delay decisions, appears willfully ignorant of the fact that there are faster sources of information than television.</p>
<p>I find it unsurprising, even fitting, that their representatives didn&#39;t recognize the inventor of the World Wide Web.</p>

		<p>almost as bad, imo, was when, during a section about the 7/7 London bombings (the day after London won the right to host the 2012 games) that was remembering the victims, NBC decided to show an interview with Phelps instead&#8230;</p>

		<p>@RP:</p>
<p>The eye-oh-see is extremely protective of their assumed right to mention anything about the sporting-event-modeled-after-an-ancient-Greek-event-of-a-similar-nature. &nbsp;So some of it is satire and some is an honest attempt to avoid involving MS in a lawsuit.</p>

		<p>In Spain, the ceremony was broadcast live by Spanish national television (TVE, Televisi&oacute;n Espa&ntilde;ola). And the commentators/translators were well informed: they had right every name I&#39;m aware of (even that of Tim Berners-Lee), and their comments about what was inspiring the act were helpful (even when you usually don&#39;t need that info for a neighbor country).</p>

		<p>Raymond: In this case, the word &quot;editorial&quot; is not being used as the noun that means &quot;an opinion piece written by the editors&quot;, but is an adjective that means &quot;the literary content&quot;. Generally speaking, &quot;commercial use&quot; means use in advertisements, while &quot;editorial use&quot; means use in any other part of the publication. Using the marks in your post would be considered editorial use.</p>
<p>frymaster: The NBC editors thought it was a generic memorial and didn&#39;t know that the memorial piece was specifically addressing 7/7. I haven&#39;t seen it, but I&#39;m guessing that there was nothing about it that overtly said &quot;7/7 bombing memorial&quot;.</p>

		<p>In the summer of 2012, many shops across England have closed. Birmingham, Newcastle, London, Southampton; all cities have been affected.</p>
<p>Several Games have closed, directing customers to their nearest branch of the sister brand, Gamestation.</p>
<p>With the cost of iron, copper, gold and silver changing, scrap dealers are having a great time, while pawnbrokers are starting to feel some pressure; people are pawning, but not rebuying.</p>
<p>Tanning salons are having to cut their prices drastically in order to meet competition from bronze sprays which are available from any corner shop now.</p>
<p>Sorry, Raymond.</p>

		<p>@GWO The Olympics don&#39;t get the same trademark protection as everyone else. &nbsp;They actually get their own special protections in their own special legislation. &nbsp;See, for example, the &quot;Olympic Symbol etc. (Protection) Act 1995&quot; and the &quot;London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Adam Rosenfield: Isn&#39;t the reason ad revenue is higher in the evening exactly because there are more people watching then? &quot;When the choice comes down to giving the people what they want or making more money&quot;: Isn&#39;t giving the people what they want how to make more money? Not that I think giving people Geraldo and the Solid Gold dancers is some kind of selfless noble act, but it&#39;s clearly giving the people what they want. (Sorry, I haven&#39;t watched TV for a long time.)</p>
<p>A large percentage of commenters on this blog sit in a cubicle and can read blogs and watch streamed sports while at work, but most people don&#39;t have that option. If most people really were able to watch during the day, ad revenue would be higher during the day.</p>

		<p>@Random832: &nbsp;I thought the same thing, that the opening ceremonies could be shown during the day and again in prime time. &nbsp;Ad rates for both broadcasts could probably be set high enough for the network to be happy. &nbsp;But the network seemed to want to broadcast the opening ceremonies in prime time *only*, for some reason. </p>

		<p>&quot;repeating events means that they would be able to show fewer events overall.&quot; &#8211; or they could just have more channels. But this argument doesn&#39;t apply to the opening ceremony &#8211; there&#39;s no event to show at 4pm.</p>

		<p>I love the BBC, but recently their events coverage has been awful. During the Jubilee boats-on-the-Thames-thing the name of which escapes me, I was watching BBC coverage &#8211; they kept cutting away from the boats to show Fearne Cotton, and when they WERE showing the boats they had no clue what was going on. I&#39;ve heard Sky&#39;s coverage was much better, but I don&#39;t fund the Murdoch empire so couldn&#39;t have watched it in HD (Sky News HD is part of the HD pack, which combined with the basic pack comes to something like 30 GBP per month&#8230;). Their opening ceremony coverage was better but stil not great &#8211; Trevor Nelson, the male black Fearne Cotton, was there to drag things down with inane comments. I bet he didn&#39;t know who Tim Berners Lee was, but at least there were two competent commentators there to speak for most of the time :p</p>

		<p>Random, I believe that they are already using all of their channels pretty much full time. &nbsp;As for the opening ceremony, as someone else stated, that probably involves things such as IOC licensing it to them for only a single full showing.</p>

		<p>GregM: NBC paid over $1,000,000,000 for the rights to air the games. That means they get to pretty much dictate the terms. If they wanted to show the opening ceremonies twice, I&#39;m sure they could have easily negotiated for it.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
