<p> The dialog box's initial title is the value specified in the resource template. And if you set it again in the <code>WM_<wbr>INIT&shy;DIALOG</wbr></code> handler, then that new title overwrites the title from the resource template. Perhaps the problem is that some other code that runs after your <code>WM_<wbr>INIT&shy;DIALOG</wbr></code> handler is changing the title yet again. </p>

<p> Being skeptical that there could ever be anything else overwriting the code I went to debug with Spy++. After some considerable effort I found out that yes, further down ~30 lines there's a call to <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Text</code>  that changes the title to something else. </p>

		<p>Sometimes when in the thick of debugging a problem it is easy to get so focused on one part of the problem that you become myopic to other possibilities. What I find strange is that they asked MS about this without (I&#39;m assuming here) asking another set of eyes within his own group to look at the code.</p>

		<p>At least the customer was courteous enough to respond. They usually just vanish when they&#39;ve overlooked the obvious solution.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time I filed a bug against .NET 2.0 after having this weird behavior in production we were failing to track down. Process Explorer would show a stack trace going straight from acquire semaphore from create thread, in a pattern that indicated livelock. Windbg kept on crashing the process trying to get good information out of it.</p>
<p>Turned out it was my own bug requiring a novel set of circumstances to create, and Process Explorer can&#39;t generate correct stacktraces of .NET process in all cases. Given the bug was a simple spinning thread repeatedly acquiring and releasing a semaphore in a loop, I never was able to learn why Windbg kept crashing the process being debugged.</p>
<p>The amusing thing is typing an incantation into Google that should mostly match that stack traces found a lot of others complaining about the exact same bug that I reported (which did not exist).</p>

		<p>If you have already payed MS (or another company) for doing time consuming debug work, don&#39;t spend time doing it yourself, learn to outsource the work. It would actually be irresponsible to do it yourself, then you spend resources twice.</p>

		<p>Firefox&#39;s windows are simply documents in an XML dialect, but the title setting code used to run at different times depending on whether you loaded the document as a new window or as a frame in the browser, causing no end of confusion.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
