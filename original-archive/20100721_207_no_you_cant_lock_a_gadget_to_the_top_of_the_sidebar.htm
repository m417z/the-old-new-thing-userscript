<p>In another installment of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/01/922449.aspx"> I bet somebody got a really nice bonus for that feature</a>, I offer you this customer:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> My customer has created a Windows Vista sidebar gadget and wants to know if there's a way to force this gadget to appear at the top of the sidebar and prevent the user from moving or removing it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I applaud this company for having written the most awesome sidebar gadget in the history of the universe. It's so compelling that it should override the user's preferences and force itself into the upper right corner of their screen in all perpetuity. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Windows was not prepared for a program as awesome as this, and there is no supported way to force a gadget into a particular position and prevent the user from moving or removing it. </p>

		<p>lol I hope that was the exact reply you emailed the customer back with. I guess management must had been afraid that the customer would be so in awe of this gadgets awesomeness they might start randomly clicking in its general vicinity and accidently remove it. That would make the customer sad since he probably couldn’t figure out how to get it back.</p>

		<p>Found this tidbit in the linked older article.</p>
<p>&quot;You do not use a notification icon to say &quot;Everything is just like it was a moment ago; nothing has changed.&quot; If nothing has changed, then say nothing.</p>
<p>Many people use the notification area to provide quick access to a running program, which runs counter to the guidance above.&quot;</p>
<p>I just find it amusing that Microsoft Security Essentials is as guilty of this as every other AV app. &nbsp;And Outlook 2007, which is running right now. &nbsp;And Office Communicator 2007. &nbsp;And the volume and network icons. &nbsp;Though to be fair AFAIK those all hide automatically in XP/Vista when they have nothing new to say.</p>

		<p>Pierre B., I believe you are on the right track there. They need a mouse driver that will automagically move the gadget to the top if it has been “accidentally” moved down by hijacking the mouse for at least a minute (that&#39;ll teach them!). This driver should also make it impossible to move the gadget in the first place or uninstall it.</p>
<p>Bonus points if it only works with one type of connector. Super bonus points if that connector is the serial port.</p>

		<p>Why not? Isn&#39;t this precisely the kind of thing that GPOs are for? You can do it for desktop items, start menu items and a slew of others. If that answer held any weight, GPOs wouldn&#39;t exist.</p>

		<p>Dan Bugglin: Two things:</p>
<p>1) Home Essentials was bought by another company that wasn&#39;t beholden to Microsoft development guidelines, and they probably just haven&#39;t gotten around to changing that behavior yet</p>
<p>2) As Raymond&#39;s mentioned numerous times, many many Microsoft products do things incorrectly&#8211; there isn&#39;t a single &quot;Interface Nazi&quot; out there approving every single widget in every single Microsoft app</p>

		<p>Raymond&#39;s post and most of the comments are full of snark&#8211;quite possibly deserved&#8211;but I can see this being a way to meet requirements of some IT departments. &nbsp;Or let&#39;s say, for a countdown on a public library where patrons get 1 hour of computer time per day and get quite angry when the system auto-logs them off despite all the warnings. &nbsp;A persistent widget could easily be abused, but there are legit reasons for asking the question.</p>

		<p>It seems that the only sort of case where there is a legitimate reason to do something like this is where the user is not the owner of the computer. &nbsp;A possible solution would be for windows to have a flag on a user account that reflects this, and allow windows programs to act differently if this user has this flag set. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There could be many scenarios where code that would otherwise be malicious would be desired. &nbsp;&#8230;of course the security issues might be too high of allowing such an account, but the Out of Browser functionality in silverlight is an example of how to &nbsp;handle that type of problem just fine. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I&#39;m surprised they had to ask. It&#39;s pretty obvious: simply uninstall all input device drivers and install a dummy mouse and keyboard driver that does nothing. They would probably also need to turn off networking, as those pesky users might try to remote desktop their way in and move or (*gasp*) remove the widget.</p>
<p>Another way is to add a run-on-startup registry item that immediately shutdown the computer. An off computer is a safe-from-user-middling computer.</p>

		<p>But you didn&#39;t say there is no *unsupported* way of doing it :) &nbsp;Time to subclass the sidebar and reverse-engineer all its internal structures. &nbsp;And if I&#39;m important enough, you&#39;ll even write a compatibility shim for me!</p>

		<p>Why a gadget?, why not just make a normal Window, then you can also set Always on Top, and maybe add a little animation, and some sound&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#39;s like those little added promotional graphics on TV (generally called &#39;bugs&#39;), I recall one with Hank Hill riding a lawnmower back and forth across the screen, WITH SOUND. Seriously. Lawnmower noise over the main show&#8230; maybe that instance was a gag or something, I dunno, I just turned off the TV at that point.</p>

		<p>You&#39;ve changed your tune MS, my ADSL modem sure found a way to be important enough to put 2 icons leading to its control panel on my desktop and have them reappear if you delete them. It also likes to sit in the system tray, the quick launch and root of the start menu</p>

		<p>I can actually see this behavior being desired in a corporate environment where a specific application needs to be made available and users keep deleting it while &quot;organizing things&quot; and then calling IT support and asking where it is.</p>

		<p>I think I&#39;d have to kill someone if I ever got around such an application.. oh god.</p>
<p>Other than that: I like the abuse of the tra.. notification area for background tasks that have to run but shouldn&#39;t take up precious taskbar space (IM, music player,..). And luckily there will always be some backwards compatible way to achieve that ;)</p>

		<p>Microsoft may have no idea how to implement such a thing, but I bet a few hundred trojan and virus authors know dozens of ways to do it. Windows has never been prepared for their awesomeness.</p>

		<p>How about having a user option to lock gadgets (or the sidebar) like you can lock the taskbar? And why do you speak in a tone as if Microsoft doesn&#39;t lock down anything or doesn&#39;t deny the user the choice of something especially something previously offered as a choice?</p>

		<p>I never cared for the gadgets either. &nbsp;They just clutter up the screen.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
