<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/09/13/752121.aspx"> When my story left off</a>, a colleague of mine had dedicated himself to finding some <i>good</i> Japanese pop music, and what he found was <a href="http://www.transbuddha.com/mediaHolder.php?id=1201"> this music video</a> of the song <a href="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Arch/ES/YUKI/ESCL-2618/"> JOY</a> by Japanese pop star <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Isoya"> Yuki Isoya</a>, who performs under the stage name <a href="http://www.yukiweb.net/">YUKI</a>.</p>
<p> The video was mesmerizing. The Flash Gordon extras. The dance steps. The blinking. The hyperventilating. (Though I don't think the blue dress suits her; she's not a teenager any more.) But the best part is the retransition from the middle section. After the wiggling fingers, she just leans into the big note and swings her arms in, well, joy. I have no idea <a href="http://lyrics.girlyrock.com/joy.php?02"> what she's saying</a>, but somehow that doesn't matter. </p>
<p> My colleague became obsessed with his own discovery, buying all of Yuki's solo albums. Apparently, he's in good company; she seems to be quite popular. The JOY video won the Japanese <a href="http://www.mva.jp/"> Space Shower Music Video Awards</a> prize for Best Video of 2006. </p>
<p> During my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/04/13/575742.aspx"> tourist day in San Francisco</a> earlier this year, I stopped by Japantown and bought two CDs. One was the album <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000793E34"> JOY</a>. Would the other songs on the album be as infectious as its title track? Fortunately, I was not disappointed. They're all great. </p>
<p> The other album I bought was <a href="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=COCX-32760"> <i>Katamari Fortissimo Damacy</i> (<span lang="ja">&#22602;&#12501;&#12457;&#12523;&#12486;&#12483;&#12471;&#12514;&#39746;</span>)</a>, the soundtrack to the video game Katamari Damacy, thereby <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/10/04/476848.aspx"> bringing the story full circle</a>. </p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t care for the game Katamari Damacy, so I haven&#8217;t heard much of its music. &nbsp;What I did hear was fairly quirky, though.</p>
<p>Now we just need to get Raymond hooked on other video game music&#8230; er&#8230; sorry, I was talking to myself there.</p>

		<p>Yeah, the music video has some pancakes in it too. H&amp;C surely had some extraordinary opening videos (both seasons).</p>

		<p>The first time I watched the opening to H&amp;C I thought it was some sort of joke. I was actually kinda disappointed when I watched the OP for the second season and it was so much less weird :)</p>
<p>Season 2&#8217;s opening video is a reference to the artwork of Jeff Koons. Season 1 is a reference to some culinary artist that I can&#8217;t remember (or maybe I never knew).</p>
<p>The real video for Dramatic is full of (obvious) references to the series, and the video for Fugainaiya is also full of (less obvious) references to the show. Since it doesn&#8217;t seem to be on youtube, screencaps of it can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.designchronicle.com/memento/archives/yuki_fugainaiya_pv_honey_and_clover_ii_op_theme.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.designchronicle.com/memento/archives/yuki_fugainaiya_pv_honey_and_clover_ii_op_theme.html</a></p>

		<p>&nbsp;There is a great dancing video game that uses JPop music called Osu Tatakae Ouendan (roughly = leaders of magnificent cheers) for the Nintendo DS. &nbsp;You tap to try to match rhythms presented on the touch-screen and your in-synchness affects how well 3 very stone faced men &quot;strike encouraging manly poses&quot; to help a troubled townsperson in their task (like studying for homework or starting their motorcycle). &nbsp;Each task is done to a different cover version of a popular JPop song.</p>

		<p>N. Velope: &nbsp;That game is being released in the USA, as &quot;Elite Beat Agents&quot;. &nbsp;Of course they changed the music to be all American songs:</p>

		<p>Sounds like DDR, too. &nbsp;(That is, Dance Dance Revolution, which I believe is for the Xbox.)</p>

		<p>DDR started in the arcades and has been put out on Dreamcast, PSX, PS2 and X-Box as far as I know.</p>
<p>The difference from DDR, I think, would be the fact that you can&#8217;t use feet on your DS.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
