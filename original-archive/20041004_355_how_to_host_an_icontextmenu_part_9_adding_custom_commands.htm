The indexMenu, idCmdFirst and idCmdLast parameters to
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/ifaces/icontextmenu/QueryContextMenu.asp">
the IContextMenu::QueryContextMenu method</a>
allow you, the host, to control where in the context menu
the IContextMenu will insert its commands.
To illustrate this, let's put two bonus commands on our
context menu, with the boring names "Top" and "Bottom".
</p>
<p>
We need to reserve some space in our menu identifiers, so
let's carve some space out for our private commands:
</p>
<pre>
#define SCRATCH_QCM_FIRST 1
<font COLOR=blue>#define SCRATCH_QCM_LAST  0x6FFF
#define IDM_TOP           0x7000
#define IDM_BOTTOM        0x7001</font>
</pre>
<p>
We reserved 0x1000 commands for ourselves, allowing the
IContextMenu to play with commands 1 through 0x6FFF.
(We could have carved our space out of the low end, too,
by increasing SCRATCH_QCM_FIRST instead of decreasing
SCRATCH_QCM_LAST.)
</p>

<p>
[Corrected insertion location for "Bottom" 9:42am.]
</p>
<p>
Before calling IContextMenu::QueryContextMenu, we added our own
custom commands (with menu identifiers outside the range we offer
to IContextMenu::QueryContextMenu so they won't conflict), and
then call IContextMenu::QueryContextMenu passing the new reduced
range as well as specifying that the insertion position is 1 instead
of 0.
</p>
<p>
When we pass the context menu to to IContextMenu::QueryContextMenu,
the menu looks like this:
</p>
<table STYLE="border: gray solid .75pt">
<tr>
<td>Top</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bottom</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
By passing 1 as the insertion point, we are telling the context menu
handler that it should insert its commands at position 1
(pushing out what is currently at positions 1 and onwards).
</p>
<table STYLE="border: gray solid .75pt">
<tr>
<td>Top</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td STYLE="border: gray solid .75pt"><br>... new stuff ...<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bottom</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
After displaying this enhanced context menu, we check which
command the user picked, whether it's one of ours (which we handle
directly) or one from the inserted portion of the context menu
(which we dispatch to the handler).</p>

		<p>In your example, wouldn&#8217;t &quot;Bottom&quot; end up on top, and &quot;Top&quot; end up on bottm?  Since you InsertMenu for &quot;Bottom&quot; at position zero after inserting &quot;Top&quot;.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
