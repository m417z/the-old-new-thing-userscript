<p> In its most general sense, the term <i>bug farm</i> refers to something that is a rich source of bugs. </p>
<p> It is typically applied to code which is nearly unmaintainable. Code can arrive in this state through a variety of means. </p>
<ul>
<li>Poor initial design. </li>
<li>An initial design that has been pushed     far beyond its original specification     (resulting in features built on top of other features in weird ways). </li>
<li>Overwhelming compatibility constraints     such that the tiniest perturbation is     highly likely to cause some application somewhere to stop working. </li>
<li>Responsibility for the code residing in people whom we shall     euphemistically describe as     "failing to meet your personal standards of code quality." </li>
</ul>
<p> The term is most often used as a cautionary term, calling attention to areas where there is high risk that code you're about to write is going to result in a bug farm. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Aren't we setting ourselves up for a bug farm? </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> This could easily lead to a bug farm from different lifetimes for this various state objects. </p>

<p> The term is quite popular at Microsoft (<b>pre-emptive snarky comment</b>: because Microsoft software is all one giant bug farm). Here are some citations just from <code>blogs.msdn.com</code>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Layout runs under disable processing. The reason we did that is because, well, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nickkramer/archive/2006/05/06/591252.aspx"> reentrant layout is a bug farm</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> A lot of testers suddenly realized that case sensitivity is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2005/05/11/416293.aspx"> a veritable bug farm</a> on a project that thinks it is ready to go, but has not yet tried it. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> That type of implicit vs. explicit inference also <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ansonh/archive/2004/03/13/89185.aspx"> turned out to be a bug farm</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Did you forget to handle an entire set of test cases?  Is the features implementation overly complex and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larsberg/archive/2005/09/05/461182.aspx"> going to be a bug farm</a>? </p>

		<p>Sadly I can apply all four of these bullet points to our current project&#8230; I&#39;m already making notes about how to blow away various poorly designed subsystems after this delivery and replace them with something better designed.</p>

		<p>Cause 3 (and perhaps also 2) leads to Arthur C Clarke&#39;s third law of software engineering: Any sufficiently successful piece of software is indistinguishable from a coding disaster area.</p>
<p>My ambition, as a programmer, is to be responsible for a really major disaster area. (In a similar vein, I hope one day to pay a truly enormous amount of tax.)</p>

		<p>Heh. When I saw the title of the article, I thought maybe it would have some connection to this:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/how-bug-bounties-are-rat-farming-092011" rel="nofollow">threatpost.com/&#8230;/how-bug-bounties-are-rat-farming-092011</a></p>
<p>But I guess I was wrong. At least, I hope so. :) &nbsp;While I always cynically suspected some of my coworkers at Microsoft were taking advantage of the screwed up &quot;highest bug-fix count wins&quot; approach to employee performance measurements by intentionally writing such buggy code as they did, surely that was not really a significant source of bugs.</p>

		<p>Halfway through the article, I was beginning to formulate a list of MS products for each of the four bullet points, but then I got to the &quot;pre-emptive snarky&quot; bit and decided to keep my trap shut :-)</p>

		<p>At my place of work we tend to see a lot of point 2, luckily not so much of 3 and 4, and sometimes point 1 (but not too much of that either, point 2 definitely takes a big lead).</p>

		<p>Most internal I/T departments (both in-house and outsourced) don&#39;t throw enough time/resources at projects to expect outcomes different from the bullet points above. &nbsp;Tech companies should be mostly exempt, but we all know Microsoft has taught us there are dramatic exceptions.</p>

		<p>That still leaves us with the &quot;by-design&quot; bugs that microsoft software have.</p>
<p>Does &quot;by-design&quot; mean: Milk the suckers of support money while not having to do anything ?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
