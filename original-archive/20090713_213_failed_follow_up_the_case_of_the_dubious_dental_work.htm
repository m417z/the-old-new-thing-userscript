<p>I've been waiting for an opportunity to do a follow-up on this story, but the trail appears to have gone cold. Here's <a href="http://www.nwnews.com/old/editions/2007/070917/front5.htm"> the story as we know it so far</a>:</p>
<p> In 2004, a woman (who had previously run unsuccessfully for a city council position) files a $6,370 claim for dental work against McDonald's, claiming that she injured her teeth biting into a cherry pie. Less than three months later, she files a $6,006 claim against McDonald's for dental work resulting from biting into a piece of bone in a cheeseburger patty. <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003878802_mcdonalds11e.html"> The insurance company investigates and determines that both claims were false</a>: The dentist who allegedly performed the dental work (coincidentally: her employer, where she had access to billing documents) says he performed no dental work on her. </p>
<p> It so happens that the year before, the woman had pled guilty to first-degree theft in which she had purchased property with her employer's money as well as embezzled $27,000 in cash. (Coincidentally, in that case, she also worked in a dentist office as an office manager.) </p>
<p> My frustration is that I haven't found any coverage of what the result of the insurance fraud charges were. There are quite a number of cases involving the defendant over the past five years,  but I think 07-1-06399-1 is the relevant one here, since the arraignment date matches the news article date to within a few weeks. </p>
<p> The hearing was continued to October 9, 2007, then delayed one more day, at which point the defendant pled guilty, and a statement to that effect was filed the next day. In November, a felony judgment and sentence was handed down (case 07-9-33438-1) consisting of $500 plus restitution. Jail time or home detention doesn't appear to be recorded into the case history, so I don't know the full extent of the sentence. </p>

		<p>Poor thing. &nbsp;If Ish had beaten Cole in the City Council contest, she undoubtedly would have found a way to divert hundreds of thousands of Duvall&#8217;s dollars into her own pockets. &nbsp;Instead she was reduced to stealing less than ten grand a year from soft targets like her boss and McDonaldâ€™s.</p>
<p>Like the saying goes: There are no small crimes, just small criminals.</p>

<p>There is a link to view the online records. &nbsp;Looks like they charge $.15 a page.</p>

		<p>It wouldn&#8217;t even occur to me to sue a restaurant over hurting my teeth biting into a bone that was accidentally left in meat. Meat contains bones, it&#8217;s fact of life.</p>

		<p>Vegetables, when harvested mechanically, can contain rocks or bits of wood.</p>
<p>Improperly maintained processing equipment (such as a meat grinder or robotic packager) can shear off bits of metal or plastic into the food.</p>
<p>Regular inspections are supposed to stop this sort of thing, but what profit-oriented middle-manager wants to risk his job recalling a million hamburger patties because one of them might contain a screw?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
