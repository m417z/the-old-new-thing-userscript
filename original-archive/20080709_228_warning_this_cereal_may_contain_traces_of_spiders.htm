<p>So food may contain traces of arachnids.</p>
<p>Well the wiki entry says &quot;insects&quot; so technically they cannot, but I doubt &quot;insect&quot; was used instead of &quot;arthropods&quot; in the real FDA documents.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, food may contain traces of motor oil&#8230; without anyone (except in Greece) seeming to care enough to ban the food:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.humaniteinenglish.com/article973.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.humaniteinenglish.com/article973.html</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s something I hate about our french government: always hiding and pointing Brussels when outraging decisions are made, like they never had any say in it.</p>
<p>Hopefully (?) sometimes the scam is too big and the products get banned:</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>And in Italian you are &quot;in ritardo&quot;. And I guess that&#8217;s similar in all other languages..</p>
<p>If yours is a silly pun on &quot;retarded&quot;, you will be happy to know that retarded means &quot;late on developing mental/social/other skills&quot;, so the similitude is not casual.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m French and I routinely misread &quot;arachide&quot; as &quot;arachnide&quot;, if that can give you some comfort.</p>

		<p>Chi tardi arriva male alloggia: These days, &quot;retarded&quot; usually means &quot;ridiculous, stupid, idiotic&quot;. Saying that a low-IQ person is &quot;retarded&quot; or &quot;a retard&quot; could be considered offensive.</p>

		<p>Retard also means something else: to slow down or decelerate.</p>
<p>When landing an aircraft, just before touchdown you raise the nose a bit and pull the throttles to idle. The latter is also called &quot;retarding the throttles&quot;.</p>
<p>In Airbus aircraft, there is an audio reminder given just before touchdown. In other words, the aircraft computer yells &quot;RETARD, RETARD&quot; at you just before touchdown. :)</p>

		<p>Sorry for posting this here, but the Suggestion Box is not accepting new comments. &nbsp;I guess it&#8217;s stuffed!</p>
<p>Suggestion:</p>
<p>I recall that several years ago I saw a Win32 API function called EnumClaw that did something hilariously useless. &nbsp;The docs said it would randomly return either the parent window of a given HWND or some other value, I don&#8217;t remember exactly. &nbsp;I assumed that this was a joke and the function was named after the city Enumclaw, WA.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t seem to find any mention of this function anymore &#8212; can you confirm or deny that this function ever existed, and when it came into being and disappeared? &nbsp;I&#8217;d love to read what the docs said about it again, too, since it was pretty funny. &nbsp;Any history on this function would be fun to hear.</p>
<p>Thank you Raymond.</p>
<p>Ben</p>

		<p>Sven: yes, but that&#8217;s aviation jargon. I haven&#8217;t checked all definitions (a fire retardant also comes to mind)&#8211;I was just commenting on the low-IQ definition and common usage of the word. The etymology is quite obvious.</p>

		<p>The fish shop at the train station in Leiden, The Netherlands used to have a big sign saying their fish was baked &quot;in 100% pure arachnid oil&quot;. I never had the heart to enlighten them about this subtlety &#8212; if only because of the loads of fun that would take away from my fellow travelers&#8230;</p>

		<p>Boris: yeah, I know, I was just adding a humorous anecdote. Because to people who don&#8217;t know this particular jargon, it sounds really weird to have an aircraft shout &quot;retard&quot; at its pilots. :)</p>
<p>In a similar story, when Mythbusters&#8217; Jamie was trying to land an aircraft (in a simulator, not a real aircraft) he wasn&#8217;t doing very well and the Ground Proximity Warning System was telling him &quot;don&#8217;t sink&quot; (meaning &quot;don&#8217;t reduce altitude&quot;) in a stern voice. On which Jamie commented: &quot;why is it telling me not to think?&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
