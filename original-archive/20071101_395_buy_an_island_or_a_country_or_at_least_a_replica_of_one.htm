		<p>I don&#8217;t understand the people who want to build on man-made islands. Won&#8217;t the land slowly settle nonuniformly? I would expect that it would be difficult to the foundations evenly supported, or even keep them above sea-level.</p>

		<p>Gabe: it depends on how deep the bedrock is, but one solution to supporting the foundations is to place them on pilings. &nbsp;My parent&#8217;s neighborhood is mostly landfill over Lake Washington and most of the houses there are on pilings. &nbsp;One that didn&#8217;t sank.</p>

		<p>There used be an expression. . . &nbsp;&quot;Buy Land. They&#8217;re not making anymore of it. . . &nbsp;unless you&#8217;re a dutchman&quot;.</p>

		<p>I watched an hour long special about this on Discovery or Science Channel or one of them. It actually is extremely disruptive to the ecosystem and the way it changed the tides almost destroyed the beach on the main land. There have been plenty of architectural problems that they discovered after the fact. Like in the original island project, the one where Trump is building a tower, the water inside the crest started stagnating because it wasn&#8217;t flowing right.</p>
<p>Anyway, shaping the land this much is sure to cause long term problems. But it&#8217;s absolutely fascinating what we&#8217;re able to do as humans.</p>

		<p>I think this was on tv many years ago, they also built two more islands south-west to it.</p>

		<p>Have they considered the possibility of the sea levels rising (due to polar icecaps melting)? &nbsp;Won&#8217;t that put their islands under water? &nbsp;If that does happen, it probably won’t be any time soon, so it won&#8217;t be their problem &#8211; it will be their grandchildren&#8217;s problem. &nbsp;Nice. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>mga,</p>
<p>For an oil producer to admit that there is such a thing as global warming, is about as difficult as for a tobacco company to admit there is such a thing as addiction.</p>
<p>I guess they’re making a ‘statement’.</p>

<p>Dubai is a brutal and repressive theocracy, and the joke about &quot;attention shoppers&quot; is merely evidence that they&#8217;ve mastered the fine art of distracting people from the truth with shiny things.</p>
<p>Yes, they have tall fancy buildings and lots of money &#8211; apparantly that&#8217;s all that people really care about.</p>

		<p>It is not locals who are buying theses places. &nbsp;There already have another set of artificial islands built like a palm <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Islands" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Islands</a> most of the people purchasing them are europians for investment and tourism so the streets are dead most of the time.</p>

		<p>&quot;It seems the definition of a dutchman is being expanded.&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
