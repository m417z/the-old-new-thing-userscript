How do I get the color depth of the screen?
This question already makes an assumption that isn't always true,
but we'll answer the question first, then discuss why the answer is wrong.
</p>
<p>
If you have a device context for the screen, you can query
the color depth with a simple arithmetic calculation:
</p>
<pre>
colorDepth = GetDeviceCaps(hdc, BITSPIXEL) *
             GetDeviceCaps(hdc, <a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/01/273018.aspx">PLANES</a>);
</pre>
<p>
Now that you have the answer, I'll explain why it's wrong,
but you can probably guess the reason already.
</p>
<p>
Two words:
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/07/9933241.aspx">
Multiple monitors</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you have multiple monitors connected to your system,
each one can be running at a different color depth.
For example, your primary monitor might be running at 32 bits per pixel,
while the secondary is stuck at 16 bits per pixel.
When there was only one monitor, there was such a thing as <i>the</i>
color depth of the screen,
but when there's more than one,
you first have to answer the question,
"Which screen?"
</p>
<p>
To get the color depth of each monitor, you can take your device
context and ask the window manager to chop the device context
into pieces, each corresponding to a different monitor.
</p>
<pre>
EnumDisplayMonitors(hdc, NULL, MonitorEnumProc, 0);

// this function is called once for each "piece"
BOOL CALLBACK MonitorEnumProc(HMONITOR hmon, HDC hdc,
                              LPRECT prc, LPARAM lParam)
{
   // compute the color depth of monitor "hmon"
   int colorDepth = GetDeviceCaps(hdc, BITSPIXEL) *
                    GetDeviceCaps(hdc, PLANES);
   return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>
If you decide to forego splitting the DC into pieces
and just ask for "the" color depth,
you'll get the color depth information for the primary
monitor.
</p>
<p>
As a bonus
(<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/02/08/9959494.aspx"
>and possible optimization</a>),
there is a system metric
<code>GetSystemMetrics(SM_SAMEDISPLAYFORMAT)</code>
which has a nonzero value if all the monitors in the system
have the same color format.</p>

		<p>Isn&#39;t it usually more appropriate to call hdc = GetDC(NULL); to get a &quot;desktop&quot; DC and use that? This topic is not well explained, but very few applications seem to use real device DCs anymore &#8211; typically an application doesnt bother to render to seperate DCs per enumerated device and just use the dc returned by BeginPaint &#8211; which would be the same kind of DC returned by GetDC(hwnd) or even GetDC(NULL). Window DCs seem to be some kind of virtual DC that represents some subset of the functionality of the various display devices that make up the desktop and it is the bit-depth of that device that most applications are interested in.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>I was assuming the question was being asked in the context of a WM_PAINT handler, in which case you should use the DC you were given. Even if being asked outside of a WM_PAINT handler, you should use GetDC(hwnd) to get a DC for your window. Screen DCs give GDI the heebie-jeebies because they are global and force certain optimizations to be disabled. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I realize the correctness of your method. I was just asking because I was curious.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing the answer is that you could get the colour depth of either &#8211; there are no guarantees and it is subject to change :)</p>

		<p>You mentioned &quot;multiple monitors&quot;, but my first thought was &quot;no monitors&quot;. &nbsp;How does that affect things? &nbsp;Or, is there always at least one &quot;monitor&quot; even if the system is booted without a connected monitor?</p>

		<p>@obelix You might still get the primary monitor. &nbsp;The API would have to return the same monitor every time it is called (otherwise it could confuse legacy apps that don&#39;t know about multiple monitors). &nbsp;Even if the app is off the primary monitor, it could be moved onto it later, or visa versa, so I would think it would always return the primary monitor information.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s more complicated than that though, I dunno. &nbsp;I don&#39;t use those APIs.</p>

		<p>How does the new window compositing play into this? Even if the displays are running at different depths, wouldn&#39;t the Window Manager handle everything internally at the highest color depth and then covert them when rendering the final output? In that case, I think most programs would be most interested in the maximum color depth of the system.</p>

		<p>Unless you&#39;re doing very high fidelity rendering (like perhaps photoshop or another image manipulation program), if you&#39;re asking this question, then you&#39;re probably worrying about something you don&#39;t need to anyway. &nbsp;It&#39;s been years since we&#39;ve had to worry about 256-color displays, which means that you&#39;re either running in 16-bit or 32-bit (likely 32-bit, with 16-bit for grandma&#39;s computer). &nbsp;Either way, since they&#39;re not palettized, just do everything assuming 32-bit and let Windows do the work of bringing you down to 16-bit if needed. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>DWalker59: I haven&#39;t tried it, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s easy to get an application to have no monitors &#8212; just start up your app and lock the workstation. Since the application&#39;s desktop is not displayed on any video hardware, it doesn&#39;t have a &quot;monitor&quot;. Other similar situations are disconnected Remote Desktop sessions and services that don&#39;t have access to the console. I believe the UAC prompt could also create this situation.</p>
<p>Jack Mathews: You&#39;re right; if you aren&#39;t rendering images (like Photoshop or a web browser), you probably shouldn&#39;t care what the monitor&#39;s color depth is.</p>

		<p>You know, I really don&#39;t know how screen DCs, Window DCs and device DCs interplay any more, especially on Windows ver 6+ where there is a DWM. When I call BeginPaint in an application with a window that spans multiple monitors, what exactly do I get? Given the layers of indirection implicit in such a thing, how is a window DC different to the &quot;desktop&quot; DC? EnumDisplayMonitors implies some kind of relationship where window DCs can be made up of display DCs &#8211; Feng Yuan used to refer to &#39;mirror drivers&#39; when answering this kind of question on the gdi newsgroups years ago, but theres no non-ddk documentation that describes what the hell those are and how they relate to calling CreateDC vs GetDC vs BeginPaint vs EnumDisplayMonitors.</p>

		<p>Anonymous:</p>
<p>Let&#39;s go through your list:</p>
<p>Remote Desktop &#8211; Fidelity not an issue as lots of stuff looks crappy. &nbsp;Render in 32-bit, it will get sent across in 16-bit (or less).</p>
<p>Windows Server Compatible Applications &#8211; Same as RD &#8211; No need to be pixel perfect, 32-bit will scale down</p>
<p>Embedded Windows Systems &#8211; Specialized system, if you want to optimize for 16-bit so your ATM machine&#39;s graphics don&#39;t band, knock yourself out</p>
<p>Sub-sub notebooks &#8211; What are you going to do? &nbsp;Make 16-bit graphics for horrible machines which will probably look the same as the 32-bit ones scaled down?</p>
<p>Regarding your quote:</p>
<p>To paraphrase the old quote, &quot;Of course I don&#39;t look like I&#39;m worried about compatibility issues popping up in the future &#8211; I did it right the first time.&quot;</p>
<p>How about the fact that if you have less code paths, you&#39;re less likely to have compat issues and regressions? &nbsp;Let&#39;s say you check for 16-bit, then you do it wrong, like, say, if multimon happens in the future. &nbsp;You&#39;ve now got a compatibility issue in the future. &nbsp;Congrats.</p>

		<p>&quot;What about safe mode? Doesn&#39;t that run in 256 colors?&quot;</p>
<p>Until XP, when VESA VBE support was added to the VGA driver used in safe mode (at the same time they boosted the minimum resolution to 800&#215;600), it used the standard 640x480x16 VGA resolution. Now of course it can ruse any video mode the VESA VBE BIOS supports.</p>

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's

is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
