<p>A few weekends ago I finally got around to watching the movie <a href="http://www.movie.de/filme/dlda/"> <i>Das Leben der Anderen</i></a>. (English: <a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/thelivesofothers/"> <i>The Lives of Others</i></a>.) Apparently <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/04/21/117575.aspx"> movies about the former East Germany</a> get screen time in the States. Go figure.</p>
<p> I'd been away from conversational German for a long time, but I was rather pleased that I was able to follow some parts without having to consult the subtitles. Though those parts didn't last long. Eventually, they'd use too many words whose meaning I couldn't guess from context, or they'd talk so indistinctly that I couldn't make out the words, or they'd just plain talk too fast and my internal parsing buffer would fill up and reject new input. I could only keep it up for brief stretches. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, I was pleased. First, I was still able to understand German <i>in German</i>. This is always a major step in learning a language, being able to understand the language on its own terms without first having to translate it into your native language, and I was happy that I hadn't regressed so far that I lost that ability. </p>
<p> And second, I found myself talking to myself in German again. This is a language trick that I developed early on: Talk to yourself in the language you're trying to acquire. Whether it's wondering out loud what you should do next, checking the time, commenting on the weather when you look out the window first thing in the morning, being angry at other cars on the road, whatever it is, say it in the language you're trying to learn. On top of that, when I listen to the radio by myself, I try to do simultaneous translation of what the newsreader is saying into my target language. Of course, I do a terrible job, but it forces me to stay nimble and exercises vocabulary recall. </p>
<p> For a few months now, I've been trying to shift my target language from Swedish to German, but whenever I started in German, I would keep slipping into Swedish. This movie appears to have kicked me over the fence. Good news for the Germans; bad news for the Swedes. </p>
<p> "Raymond, why do you watch so many <a href="http://www.seattlefilm.org/festival/film/results.aspx?CID=25&amp;FID=32"> German movies</a>?" </p>
<p> Because it's hard to find <a href="http://www.seattlefilm.org/festival/film/results.aspx?CID=56&amp;FID=32"> Swedish movies</a> in this country. </p>
<p> <b>Sidebar</b> </p>
<p> Groups of ten or more visiting the <a href="http://www.stasi-museum.de/"> Stasi Museum</a> in former East Berlin can request a guided tour in German, English, or, curiously, <a href="http://www.stasi-museum.de/besuch.htm"> Swedish</a>. </p>

		<p>Not a bad movie, though I wonder whether it isn&#8217;t a little soon to really get a handle on the period. I also wonder whether the power of art to change one&#8217;s life isn&#8217;t overstated.</p>
<p>&quot;Leben der Anderen&quot; seems as if it alludes to something, but a Rhinelander I work with thought not. Any clues?</p>

		<p>It can&#8217;t be that hard to find Swedish films in the US. It could be a bit tricky explaining to anyone you know as you come out of the theater why you were in there though:</p>
<p>&quot;I was just, err, brushing up on my language skills!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah? A lot of oral, was there?&quot;</p>

<p>Hallo!</p>
<p>Es freut mich, dass Ihnen der Film gut gefallen hat. Ich hatte leider noch nicht die M&#246;glichkeit den Film zu sehen. Sollten Sie interessiert sein einen andere guten deutschen Film zu sehen, sollten Sie sich &quot;Die F&#228;lscher&quot; ansehen. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0813547/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0813547/</a></p>

		<p>Use the &quot;angry at other cars on the road&quot; advice only outside of the country where that language is used :) For instance, in the US, it&#8217;s waaaay better to swear at everyone and everything else in Russian, as opposed to English or Spanish. Wider variety of profanity, and nobody gets very mad at you since they know you&#8217;re angry at them but they don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re saying :D</p>

		<p>Tell us what you thought of the film, Raymond. While aware of the fictionality of the repentant Stasi officer, I thought it was an excellent film.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already done so, I&#8217;d recommend the (non-fiction) book Stasiland by Anna Funder.</p>

		<p>Why shouldn&#8217;t he talk about the war? It is a normal topic: there are quite a few documentaries about it on TV, a lot of class-time is used to teach students about it (and more importantly about the events that led to it). You just should not glorify it or deny the holocaust, that&#8217;s all.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been to that museum. &nbsp;One of the most chilling experiences of my life. &nbsp;They&#8217;d done nothing to the place, it is just like it was the day the wall fell. &nbsp;Lots of padded cells with scratch marks in the walls. &nbsp;I got lost in the place (take the guided tour) and freaked out a bit. &nbsp;Definitely a worth while stop on yor tour of how evil humanity is&#8230;.</p>

		<p>Just in case you haven&#8217;t come across it yet, you should definately watch Schtonk! ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0105328/" rel="nofollow">http://imdb.com/title/tt0105328/</a> ). It&#8217;s about the fake Hitler diaries that were sold to one of the biggest german magazines back in the 80s. Priceless.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230;a language trick that I developed early on: Talk to yourself in the language you&#8217;re trying to acquire&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>I have been using this technique myself too, (auch mit Deutcsch)- however I find that there&#8217;s the risk of occasionally making up wrong phrases/constructs and embedding them in your brain for good.</p>

		<p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>This movie is really one of the best we had in Germany recently. If you want to have a good laugh with a recent German movie, checkout &quot;Lammbock&quot;.</p>

		<p>Excellent choice!</p>
<p>In the end of the movie, when he was reading through the pile of his own Stasi-files, and when he found the microphones in his home, I was really shaken.</p>
<p>Too bad that once forgotten east-german techniques now have quite a revival in Germany and especially Heilgendamm and the G8-submit: Collecting scents, nation-wide introduction of the Bundestrojaner (an idea of developing government spyware) and of course what Germany is best at: Building walls. (Or fences in that case).</p>
<p>Too sad. I hope we can at least watch an equally good movie in a few decades about what will happen in the next years here</p>

		<p>Ah Raymond, I too use this language trick. It even sometimes go so far that when analyzing a problem at work me and a few coworkers start to speak our thoughts in a different language (in German most often). It&#8217;s usually a lot of fun, and sometimes helps to see a problem which you might not see if you are concetrating too hard (and miss the obvious).</p>

		<p>@George: Form my (gladly limited) experience, it seems an excellent piece to transport a feel for situation to someone who has never lived something similar.</p>
<p>An excellent movie for many reasons. Raymond, I hope you enjoyed it beyond the talking-to-yourselves ;-)</p>

		<p>As you can see, there is a fashion about these Eastern European retro movies (East of Bucharest, Lives of Others etc). They have the regular power of attraction of an exotic movie, but these ones have something extra: it&#8217;s not just a different culture than the one Westerners are living in, it&#8217;s a culture that doesn&#8217;t exist anymore. You can&#8217;t buy a ticket to that world. It&#8217;s not an utopia, it&#8217;s an ucronia.</p>

		<p>Oh yes, the power of art. Somebody,up there has doubts about it.Poor Wiesler&#8217;s empty,stale and lonely life is turned over when he hears the poem&quot;von der weissen Wolke ungeheuer oben&quot; it gives him a glimpse of the life of the others,naybe for the first time in his life and his tears open the floodgates of human joy,grief and tenderness. He now belongs to the others too. Need I say more?This film is beautiful. A triumph of&quot;Der Gute Mensch&quot;!JS</p>

		<p>For German, I highly recommend listening to &lt;a href=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammstein&quot;&gt;Rammstein&lt;/a&gt;" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammstein&quot;&gt;Rammstein&lt;/a&#038;gt" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammstein&quot;&gt;Rammstein&lt;/a&#038;gt</a>; on a regular basis, the lyrics stay in your head, and due to the regular nature of their layout, and repetition (e.g. choruses), they reinforce themselves.</p>
<p>But it does require cranking up to 11&#8230;</p>

		<p>*sigh* and the newbie poster encounters the html block&#8230;.</p>
<p>That was meant to say &quot;Rammstein&quot; with a link to <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammstein" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammstein</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get my coat&#8230;.!</p>

		<p>Oh, the Cannes Juray awarded their best movie prize to one of those East retro movies. The Occident has fallen under the spell. I should start a business selling Trabis. :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
