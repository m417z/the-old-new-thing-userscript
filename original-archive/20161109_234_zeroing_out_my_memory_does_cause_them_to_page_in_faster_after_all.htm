<p>Not too long ago, I answered the question
"If I zero out my memory pages,
does that make them page in faster?"
with
"<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160907-00/?p=94265">No</a>."
</p>
<p>
Turns out that I was working from outdated information.
</p>
<p>
My former colleague Adrian Oney
(who, among other things, has shared with us the story of the
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040726-00/?p=38343#comment-198323">
USB Cart of Death</a>)
confirms the information in
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613877.aspx">
the white paper shared by commenter John Doe</a>,
namely that starting in Windows Vista,
the memory manager does check whether a page that is about to paged out
consists entirely of zeroes.
If so, then the memory manager turns the page into a demand-zero page
rather than a page stored in the pagefile (that happens to contain nothing
but zeroes).
</p>
<p>
Adrian
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160907-00/?p=94265#comment-1264885">
said</a>
that he wrote the original prototype which confirmed that the extra
check was worth it.
"Some of this was due to apps dirtying their zero-init pages with inits
to zero.
Some of it was due to user mode zeroing pages for security reasons.
But it was common enough to make it worthwhile."
</p>
<p>
I suspect that the increasing use of virtualization may contribute to this
virtuous cycle as well.
If the app is running in a virtual machine, then it's a big win to avoid
having to perform virtualized I/O.</p>

		<p>I suspect that virtualization was indeed why it was worth it. Linux has this habit of using the idle job to zero freed pages in the background.</p>
<p>(It doesn&#8217;t take much for checking for zero page to win because most memory use on a part page is at the beginning of the page and rep cmpsd (comparing against the real zero page of course) is really fast compared to the time required to write to disk.</p>

		<p>Of course, even better (on a POSIX system) is to just call madvise() and indicate that you don&#8217;t care about the contents without actually having to touch them.  Does Windows have a comparable facility?</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t imagine how big the page file would get without support for this, particularly on virtualization servers. The performance boost from the avoided IOPs alone must be massive.</p>

		<p>With memory compression of Windows 10 you get these checks anyway. It even allows private page sharing between different processes which adds: If I ensure that my memory contents (page aligned) in different processes are identical will it then page faster to: Yes (see <a href="https://aloiskraus.wordpress.com/2016/10/03/windows-10-memory-compression-and-more/" rel="nofollow">https://aloiskraus.wordpress.com/2016/10/03/windows-10-memory-compression-and-more/</a> ). On Server 2012 and later the memory manager can share private identical pages already if you enable that memory manager setting. As far as I know it has been pretty much disabled in Windows 10 for security reasons. Memory compression is on Windows 10 the best setting to make things page faster if much identical or zeroed out memory is about to be paged out.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
