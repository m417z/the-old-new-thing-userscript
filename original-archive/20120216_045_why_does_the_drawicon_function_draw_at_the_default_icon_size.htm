<p>Miral wondered <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/29/10043635.aspx#10044060"> why the <code>Draw&shy;Icon</code> function draws at the default icon size instead of respecting the actual icon size</a>. After all, if you loaded a nonstandard-sized icon via <code>Load&shy;Image</code>, then presumably you want to use that nonstandard size.</p>
<p> The question is one of those types of questions that fails to understand history, like asking why NASA didn't send the space shuttle to rescue the Apollo&nbsp;13 astronauts. </p>
<p> At the time the <code>Draw&shy;Icon</code> function was written, the <code>Load&shy;Image</code> function didn't exist, and wouldn't exist for over a decade. The <code>Load&shy;Image</code> function showed up in Windows&nbsp;95, but Windows was drawing icons long before then, and for a long time, the only way to load icons was with the <code>Load&shy;Icon</code> function, which always loaded icons at their default size. When the ability to create nonstandard-sized icons was added, you then had the question of how to draw them. Code which relied on the fact that all icons were the same size would call <code>Draw&shy;Icon</code> expecting the result to be a 32&times;32 image (or whatever your icon size was). If you drew it at its actual size, you would either have this L-shaped "hole" in the application (if the actual size was smaller), or you would have an icon that overflowed some other part of the application. Either way you lose. </p>
<p> Therefore, <code>Draw&shy;Icon</code> always draws at the standard icon size. Think of it as <code>Draw&shy;Icon&shy;Back&shy;Compat</code>. If you are a fancy new application that can handle icons at nonstandard sizes, then use <code>Draw&shy;Icon&shy;Ex</code> and don't pass the <code>DI_<wbr>DEFAULT&shy;SIZE</wbr></code> flag. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: The documentation states that the <code>DI_<wbr>COMPAT</wbr></code> has no effect. Presumably it had an effect in some previous version of Windows? </p>
<p> In Windows&nbsp;95, if you used the <code>LoadCursor</code> to load a standard cursor (like, say, <code>IDC_<wbr>ARROW</wbr></code>), but the standard arrow cursor was customized by the user, Windows would draw the customized cursor. Passing the <code>DI_<wbr>COMPAT</wbr></code> flag forced the standard arrow cursor to be drawn. <strike>So far as I can tell, nobody ever passed that flag.</strike> </p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: My claim that nobody passed that flag is incorrect. The <code>Draw&shy;Icon</code> function itself passed that flag (and still does today, even though it no longer does anything). </p>

		<p>Interestingly, MSDN says</p>
<p>To duplicate DrawIcon (hDC, X, Y, hIcon), call DrawIconEx as follows:</p>
<p>DrawIconEx (hDC, X, Y, hIcon, 0, 0, 0, NULL, DI_NORMAL | DI_COMPAT | DI_DEFAULTSIZE);</p>
<p>Why do I need to specify DI_COMPAT, if DI_COMPAT is ignored? &nbsp;(Perhaps DrawIconEx says that for those three flags, with the previous four parameters set to 0, it simply calls DrawIcon.)</p>

		<p>&quot;why NASA didn&#39;t send the space shuttle to rescue the Apollo 13 astronauts?&quot;</p>
<p>Easy!</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;The shuttle takes too long to get ready, &nbsp;fueled etc for launch. &nbsp; Apollo 13 couldn&#39;t wait that long for rescue.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;The oxygen tank on apollo 13 exploded when they were approaching the moon, &nbsp;the shuttle is only able to reach earth orbit and wouldn&#39;t have been able to reach them.</p>

		<p>@Jon: &nbsp;The shuttle still could have docked with the Apollo 13 module when they got back to avoid the dangerous re-entry. &nbsp;As a bonus, the shuttle could have simply dropped off the astronauts at the International Space Station.</p>

		<p>@Joshua &#8211; Well, obviously they would also have to design and build a Space Shuttle, but the problem of the extra time that would add is essentially academic, considering the plan is already not viable due to the other issues.</p>

		<p>The Apollo 13 crew could have saved themselves all that difficulty if they had only landed at the Moon colony. Better yet, they could have watched the movie and fixed the problem before leaving Earth!</p>

		<p>@JJJ &#8211; The Apollo capsules weren&#39;t designed to reestablish orbit around the earth before reentering. &nbsp;They came straight back from the moon on a reentry profile. &nbsp;That means even if you had a shuttle there&#39;s no way it could rendezvous with a returning Apollo 13 because the Apollo capsule didn&#39;t have the capability to match orbits with it.</p>

		<p>Regarding the update, does that mean that when DrawIconEx was added, DrawIcon&#39;s body was replaced with a call to DrawIconEx (or the moral equivalent) (as opposed to being entirely replaced with a macro, like GetWindowLongPtr is under win32 (as opposed to win64,) since DrawIcon is defined in winuser.h as a function? &nbsp;(DrawIcon isn&#39;t documented as taking a flag-type parameter, nor is DI_COMPAT (or any other flag) mentioned on DrawIcon&#39;s page.)</p>

<p>To be able to call LoadImage, you had to develop *new* code. That *new* code is of course developed with nonstandard sized icons in mind. I don&#39;t see the problem here.</p>

		<p>Speaking of DrawIconEx, how do I draw the Windows&#39; own icons in the current icon size &#8211; specifically, I&#39;m trying to use the message box icons (OIC_NOTE etc.), but they always load as 32Ã32 (I tried both LoadIcon and LoadImage to load them, and DrawIcon and DrawIconEx; DrawIcon will scale the image to the correct size, but this results in a jaggy icon rather than the nice pre-scaled version that message boxes use).</p>

		<p>A problem with scaling images is that upscaling a small image is very easily ugly. I&#39;d have centered them instead (but still downscaled bigger icons).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
