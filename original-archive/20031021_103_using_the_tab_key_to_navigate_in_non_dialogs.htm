        The IsDialogMessage function works even if you aren't a dialog. As long as your child
        windows have the WS_TABSTOP and/or WS_GROUP styles, they can be navigated as if they
        were part of a dialog box. One caveat is that IsDialogMessage will send DM_GETDEFID
        and DM_SETDEFID messages to your window, which are message numbers WM_USER and WM_USER+1,
        so you should avoid using those messages in your window procedure for some other purpose. 
    </p>
<p>
        These changes to our scratch program illustrate how you can use the TAB key to navigate
        within a non-dialog.

<pre>HWND g_hwndLastFocus;

void OnSetFocus(HWND hwnd, HWND hwndOldFocus)
{
    if (g_hwndLastFocus) {
        SetFocus(g_hwndLastFocus);
    }
}

void OnActivate(HWND hwnd, UINT state,
                HWND hwndActDeact, BOOL fMinimized)
{
    if (state == WA_INACTIVE) {
        g_hwndLastFocus = GetFocus();
    }
}

// Just display a messagebox so you can see something
void OnCommand(HWND hwnd, int id, HWND hwndCtl, UINT codeNotify)
{
    switch (id) {
    case 100:
        MessageBox(hwnd, TEXT("Button 1 pushed"),
                   TEXT("Title"), MB_OK);
        break;
    case 101:
        MessageBox(hwnd, TEXT("Button 2 pushed"),
                   TEXT("Title"), MB_OK);
        break;
    case IDCANCEL:
        MessageBox(hwnd, TEXT("Cancel pushed"),
                   TEXT("Title"), MB_OK);
        break;
    }
}

BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
    HWND hwndChild =
        CreateWindow(
        TEXT("button"),                 /* Class Name */
        TEXT("Button &amp;1"),              /* Title */
        WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_TABSTOP |
        BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON | BS_TEXT,     /* Style */
        0, 0, 100, 100,                 /* Position and size */
        hwnd,                           /* Parent */
        (HMENU)100,                     /* Child ID */
        g_hinst,                        /* Instance */
        0);                             /* No special parameters */
    if (!hwndChild) return FALSE;
    g_hwndLastFocus = hwndChild;

    hwndChild =
        CreateWindow(
        TEXT("button"),                 /* Class Name */
        TEXT("Button &amp;2"),              /* Title */

    if (!hwndChild) return FALSE;

    hwndChild =
        CreateWindow(
        TEXT("button"),                 /* Class Name */
        TEXT("Cancel"),                 /* Title */
        WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_TABSTOP |
        BS_PUSHBUTTON | BS_TEXT,        /* Style */
        200, 0, 100, 100,               /* Position and size */
        hwnd,                           /* Parent */
        (HMENU)IDCANCEL,                /* Child ID */
        g_hinst,                        /* Instance */
        0);                             /* No special parameters */
    if (!hwndChild) return FALSE;

    return TRUE;
}

//  Add to WndProc

    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_COMMAND, OnCommand);
    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_ACTIVATE, OnActivate);
    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_SETFOCUS, OnSetFocus);

    // Add blank case statements for these to ensure we don't use them
    // by mistake.
    case DM_GETDEFID: break;
    case DM_SETDEFID: break;

//  Change message loop
    MSG msg;
    while (GetMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
        if (IsDialogMessage(hwnd, &amp;msg)) {
            /* Already handled by dialog manager */
        } else {
            TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
            DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
        One subtlety is the additional handling of the WM_ACTIVATE and WM_SETFOCUS messages
        to preserve the focus when the user switches away from the window and back. Notice
        also that we picked Button 1 as our initial default button by setting it with the
        BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON style. 
    </p>
<p>
        Observe that all the standard dialog accelerators now work. The TAB key navigates,
        the Alt+1 and Alt+2 keys act as accelerators for the two buttons, the Enter key presses
        the default button, and the ESC key pushes the Cancel button since its control ID
        is IDCANCEL.

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
