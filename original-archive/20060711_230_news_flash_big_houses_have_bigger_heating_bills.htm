		<p>The sad thing about this is that a good HVAC design could probably save them a lot of money. Houses in the US are very poorly designed because energy has always been cheap. Larger houses can use multi-zoned systems, and houses with lots of glass can benefit from automated shade systems.</p>
<p>Another problem can be mismatched systems. I made the mistake of upgrading my heat pump to one that is larger than I need, and my energy bills went up.</p>

		<p>DavidE: Energy wasn&#8217;t always cheap. &nbsp;Remember the &quot;energy crisis&quot; of the 1970s? &nbsp;My house was built in the late &#8217;70s, and it was certainly designed with energy efficiency in mind &#8211; southern-facing windows, 2&quot;x8&quot; studs in all of the outside walls instead of 2x4s, a heat pump-based cooling system, etc. &nbsp;But you are right &#8211; if taken at a glance, most American houses aren&#8217;t designed for energy efficiency (probably because it isn&#8217;t exactly cheap initially).</p>

		<p>Here in California, electricity costs are proportional to a &quot;baseline&quot; quantity, an estimate of how much electricity a house could/should use per month. &nbsp;The baseline is determined by your location rather than the size of your home or how many people live there. &nbsp;The cost of electricity up to your baseline is relatively cheap. &nbsp;Above the baseline, it goes up in large steps, especially large since the power crisis a couple summers ago.</p>
<p>I had a 750 sq. ft. apartment in Sunnyvale, which had a baseline usage of 720 kWh/month. &nbsp;It&#8217;s inconceivable to me that I could have possibly used that much.</p>
<p>I got married and moved to a 2200 sq. ft. house in Hayward. &nbsp;My baseline now is a mere 340 kWh/month. &nbsp;It&#8217;s almost impossible to get through a month below that.</p>

		<p>&quot;probably because it isn&#8217;t exactly cheap initially&quot;</p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s not the case &#8212; with proper design the extra building cost is insignificant or even entirely absent, or so I&#8217;ve read.</p>

		<p>Daniel, your house may be better than some, but it doesn&#8217;t make it &quot;efficient&quot;. My house has all of the same features yours does, but I still use 3 times as much energy in the winter than in the summer. I&#8217;m starting to wonder whether or not the resistance heating thermostat is set incorrectly&#8230;</p>

		<p>Adrian: &nbsp;I live in the desert, and what really got us was that the &quot;summer&quot; baseline doesn&#8217;t start until June 1. &nbsp;This year, I count 8 days in May that the high temperature where we live was over 95 F, and only 3 days that it was below 80 F, but we were supposed to be on (much lower) &quot;winter&quot; usage.</p>

		<p>No Cooney, I think California screwed California. NIMBY is a strong force on the Left Coast and power plants and transmission facilities are very difficult to get approved. Although, the situation should improve as crisis in 2001 led to solution and new plants are coming on line now. Should help with the blackouts, but won&#8217;t help much with pricing.</p>

		<p>Apparently, Enron helped a lot by getting power plants to take maintenance windows in peak demand periods. Coordinate enough of those, and you get rolling blackouts. Yeah, the half assed dereg had a lot to do with it, but Enron had a big part too.</p>
<p>Are they finally coming around to nuke plants?</p>

		<p>Sure, this is a &quot;duh&quot; title after analysis, but there&#8217;s only so many times you can report &quot;energy prices are up!&quot; before things tend to get repetitive.</p>
<p>From a readership point of view, this is good title &#8211; a lot of people have upgraded houses recently based on home sales and interest rates, and this title will draw them in to read it.</p>
<p>So, yes, &quot;duh&quot;. &nbsp;But you found it and linked it. &nbsp;They win.<br /></p>

		<p>I recently read something on a big dutch tecno news site(tweakers.net). The news was in the line of:</p>
<p>Hackers are actually trying to hack!!!!</p>
<p>With a story of hackers creating fake website for users to insert their personal data and passwords. I might expect something like that in a local newspaper, but on a big news site is was strange.</p>

<p>Muckenfuss</p>
<p>What a great name! &nbsp;It sounds like what I do with my computers everyday. &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure that if they were giving out surnames today, they would name me Muckenfuss. &nbsp;I bet a lot of you out there would be named Muckenfuss too. &nbsp;;-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
