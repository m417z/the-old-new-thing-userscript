<p>Suppose you have a COM server object that runs out-of-process. A client connects to the COM server and creates an object. And then the client crashes. What happens to the server object?</p>
<p> It will get released eventually. </p>
<p> COM periodically checks whether the clients are still alive, and it runs down interfaces from dead clients. <i>Run-down</i> (often spelled <i>rundown</i>) is a technical term used by COM to refer to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa378673(v=vs.85).aspx"> cleaning up abandoned objects</a>. </p>
<p> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/171414"> Knowledge Base 171414</a> describes the mechanism in some detail. (There are a bunch of optimizations in play here. You can read the Knowledge Base article to learn about some of them.) The short version is that every two minutes, the COM client pings the server to say, "Hey, I'm still alive." If the COM server doesn't hear from the client for six minutes, then it assumes that the client is dead and runs down the objects for that client. </p>
<p> Therefore, if a client dies, your server object will be cleaned up between six and twelve (eight?) minutes later. </p>

		<p>Both &quot;six to twelve minutes&quot; and &quot;six to eight minutes&quot; seem wrong. The answer is actually &quot;four to six minutes&quot; as stated.</p>

		<p>less than six minutes</p>
<p>Better case: Just before ping : 0 minutes</p>
<p>Worst case: Just after ping : 6 minutes</p>

		<p>Four to six minutes is right.</p>
<p>Minute 0: Last known ping</p>
<p>Minute 2: Server doesn&#39;t receive ping; believes Client may have been dead for 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Minute 4: Server doesn&#39;t receive ping; believes Client may have been dead for 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Minute 6: Server doesn&#39;t receive ping; believes Client may have been dead for 6 minutes. Server runs down Client&#39;s objects.</p>
<p>If the client died at Minute 0 just after its ping, it&#39;ll have been dead for 6 minutes when the server runs down. If it died just before its next ping at minute 2, it&#39;ll have been dead for 4 minutes</p>

		<p>Alex is omitting ping transit time, usually max transit time is 120 seconds (2 minutes).</p>

		<p>What happens to an instance referred?</p>
<p>Is it paged out like a reniced process on Sun?</p>
<p>Does it pause in the background &#8212; and then run?</p>
<p>Maybe it just polls with a heavy load.</p>
<p>Or does it explode?</p>

		<p>What if the client does some heavy processing (or is paused by debugger, anti-virus scanner, stuck waiting on disk or network, modal dialog) and respond after (let&#39;s say) 10 minutes? Does it crash because the resources on server-side are now destroyed?</p>

		<p>It looks like the linked KB article is about DCOM specifically, and does not address the situation where a COM client and server are on the same computer (other than to say that it is a different mechanism).</p>
<p>So, Marek, the client doesn&#39;t send the pings; the RPCSS process does. It just sends a single ping from one machine to another. This actually allows the server machine to detect a client machine crash, not a client process crash. If the client process crashes, presumably RPCSS detects that and just sends a Release to the server.</p>

		<p>Gabe: I would assume the RPCSS can detect when the client process terminates (via a crash or otherwise) when the HANDLE to the client process becomes signalled. </p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
