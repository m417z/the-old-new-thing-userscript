		<p>Off-topic:<br />
<br />I wonder why programmers tend towards various but mostly predictable hobbies: juggling, martial arts, cartoons, gaming, techy gadgety hacks (okay, that&#8217;s a given), etc.</p>
<p>Juggling in particular seems like a strange correlation.  I learned to juggle when I should&#8217;ve been studying for finals.  And since there were a lot of finals I should&#8217;ve been studying for I learned to juggle pretty well.  ;-)</p>
<p>Any tips from some more accomplished jugglers for someone who does 3 pretty well trying to learn 4?  (Crossing over, not 2 in each hand)</p>

		<p>I guess if you list all hobbies available, then you can say any group chooses predictable (listed) hobbies :-).</p>

		<p>If you want to cross four balls you have to either throw a 5-ball pattern (4 with a hole) or throw them in a shower pattern (a circle).  That&#8217;s the way the math works out.</p>
<p>See examples here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://juggling.org/help/balls/four/" rel="nofollow">http://juggling.org/help/balls/four/</a></p>

		<p>I started juggling last summer. I can do a 5 cascade pretty well now (maxing out at 107 catches, last night actually). It&#8217;s a fantastically fun thing to do. I&#8217;ve discovered that people are pretty unimpressed with you until you can do 5, at that point, they&#8217;ll look at you mildly interested for 3-5 minutes. But I do it for myself, not for them.</p>
<p>Learning new things in juggling is a very incremental process. You have to start on the easier things before you can move to the harder. Don&#8217;t skip steps.</p>
<p>&quot;Crossing over&quot; with 4 balls (assuming you mean like a 3 ball cascade, but with 4) is hard, because it is asymmetrical. Definitely start with 2 in each hand first. Then you can try a synchronous half shower (throw two balls at once to the other hand, one ball going higher than the other ball). And learn a bunch of 3 ball tricks first too. Get your brain prepared for the extra speed of that fourth ball.</p>

		<p>Why do programmers gravitate to juggling?</p>
<p>1. Something to do during those long compiles<br />
<br />back in school, when it&#8217;s too impractical<br />
<br />to get a football or baseball game going.</p>
<p>2. Club passing, particularly with more than<br />
<br />two passers, is like a physical realization of<br />
<br />an elegant 5-line lisp function.</p>
<p>3. Two words: site swaps</p>
<p>4. Trivia question (it&#8217;s not horrible<br />
<br />etiquette to pose one in someone else&#8217;s<br />
<br />comment blog, is it?):</p>
<p>Which well-known juggler has a Knuth book<br />
<br />dedicated to him?  Which Knuth book?</p>

		<p>How could you forget the beloved hobby of music? We OWN that one!!   12 guys in my group, I play sax and about 8 play guitar, one being a music major. How do you like those odds?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
