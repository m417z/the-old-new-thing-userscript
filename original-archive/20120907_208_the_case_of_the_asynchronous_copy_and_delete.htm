<p>
A customer reported some strange behavior in the
<code>Copy&shy;File</code> and <code>Delete&shy;File</code>
functions.
They were able to reduce the problem to a simple test program,
which went like this (pseudocode):
</p>
<pre>
// assume "a" is a large file, say, 1MB.

while (true)
{
  // Try twice to copy the file
  if (!CopyFile("a", "b", FALSE)) {
    Sleep(1000);
    if (!CopyFile("a", "b", FALSE)) {
      fatalerror
    }
  }

  // Try twice to delete the file
  if (!DeleteFile("b")) {
    Sleep(1000);
    if (!DeleteFile("b")) {
      fatalerror
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
When they ran the program, they found that sometimes the copy
failed on the first try with error&nbsp;5
(<code>ERROR_<wbr>ACCESS_<wbr>DENIED</code>)
but if they waited a second and tried again, it succeeded.
Similarly, sometimes the delete failed on the first try,
but succeeded on the second try if you waited a bit.
</p>
<p>
What's going on here?
It looks like the
<code>Copy&shy;File</code> is returning before the file copy
is complete, causing the
<code>Delete&shy;File</code>
to fail because the copy is still in progress.
Conversely, it looks like the
<code>Delete&shy;File</code> returns before the file is deleted,
causing the
<code>Copy&shy;File</code> to fail because the destination exists.
</p>
<p>
The operations
<code>Copy&shy;File</code> and
<code>Delete&shy;File</code> are synchronous.
However, the NT model for file deletion is that a file is
deleted when the last open handle is closed.&sup1;
If <code>Delete&shy;File</code> returns and the file still exists,
then it means that somebody else still has an open handle to the file.
</p>
<p>
So who has the open handle?
The file was freshly created, so there can't be any pre-existing
handles to the file,
and we never open it between the copy and the delete.
</p>
<p>
My psychic powers said,
"The offending component is your anti-virus software."
</p>
<p>
I can think of two types of software that goes around snooping
on recently-created files.
One of them is an indexing tool,
but those tend not to be very aggressive about accessing files
the moment they are created.
They tend to wait until the computer is idle to do their work.
Anti-virus software, however, runs in real-time mode,
where they check every file as it is created.
And that's more likely to be the software that snuck in and
opened the file after the copy completes so it can perform a
scan on it,
and that open is the extra handle that is preventing the deletion
from completing.
</p>
<p>
But wait, aren't anti-virus software supposed to be using
oplocks so that they can close their handle and get out of the way
if somebody wants to delete the file?
</p>
<p>
Well, um, yes, but "what they should do" and "what they actually do"
are often not the same.
</p>
<p>
We never did hear back from the customer whether the guess was
correct,
which could mean one of various things:
</p>
<ol>
<li>They confirmed the diagnosis and didn't feel the need to
    reply.</p>
<li>They determined that the diagnosis was incorrect but didn't
    bother coming back for more help,
    because "those Windows guys don't know what they're talking about."</p>
<li>They didn't test the theory at all, so had nothing to report.
</ol>
<p>
We may never know what the answer is.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>
</p>
<p>
&sup1;Every so often, the NT file system folks dream of changing
the deletion model to be more Unix-like, but then they wonder if
that would end up breaking more things than it fixes.</p>

		<p>The old Indexing Service (NT4 through XP) had a similar bug. &nbsp;If you quickly created and deleted a directory the Indexing Service would retain a handle to it, leaving a zombie directory that you couldn&#39;t do anything with. &nbsp;Killing the service killed the zombie.</p>

<p>Do you know the history of &#39;why&#39; the current model was chosen? &nbsp;It seems to be more complicated to use, and I assume more complicated to implement. So therefore I suppose it must have been chosen deliberately, but why?</p>

		<p>Well I know it about the interference being blamed on antivirus. We have had similar incidents for which we gave the same explanation by the same twists of reasoning, but when its our customers that hit it and they are unwilling to remove the antivirus to test it (merely disable doesn&#39;t actually work with most antivirus software when you&#39;re trying to probe for the problems it causes) so it never gets truly tested.</p>
<p>[¬πEvery so often, the NT file system folks dream of changing the deletion model to be more Unix-like, but then they wonder if that would end up breaking more things than it fixes.]</p>
<p>In my testing, 99% of programs that don&#39;t pass FILE_SHARE_DELETE to CreateFile are safe to do so, and 99% of these don&#39;t pass it because they create via fopen() which doesn&#39;t know. fopen() probably should pass FILE_SHARE_DELETE because it originated on UNIX where that was the behavior.</p>
<p>Do that little bit, that is, find a way to change the default behavior to FILE_SHARE_DELETE asserted, and I can test for the rest, as to whether or not such a program will actually break. A new flag to MoveFileEx and CreateFileEx to cross-assert FILE_SHARE_DELETE would work just as well.</p>

		<p>Interference from AntiVirus and other &quot;grabby&quot; software is the reason why I am paranoid about closing a file I am soon going to re-open nowadays. We&#39;ve seen cases where we close a temporary file we created and noone else should care about, almost immediately try to re-open it and get a sharing violation. Something &quot;grabbed&quot; it as soon as we let go of it. Not very nice. It was backup software, I think.</p>

		<p>Anti-Virus software might be the number one offender in such a situation, but the Shell&#39;s video file analyzer is certainly a close second. More often than not, I&#39;m not able to delete video files because Explorer does stuff like compute the duration of the file (which I&#39;m not interested at) or generate thumbnails (which I generally don&#39;t use). In Windows XP, there was a simple workaround for this (regsvr /u shmedia.dll), but in Windows 7, the only way to stop the madness is to remove HKCR.&lt;filetype&gt;ShellEx{3D1975AF-0FC3-463d-8965-4DC6B5A840F4} for every possible video file type. Even worse, these entries might reappear after updates :(</p>

		<p>We commonly see this while doing builds. &nbsp;The linker creates a new .dll or .exe and a corresponding .pdb, and it takes a while for the anti-malware (and other IT-mandated surveillance software) to do their scans of the new files, especially since the build is largely I/O bound anyway. &nbsp;Meanwhile, in a subsequent build step, the manifest tool tries to update the manifest information in newly-created binary, but it fails because the aforementioned software still has the files locked for the duration of their scans.</p>
<p>After upgrading the toolchain, we&#39;ve seen that the manifest tool now backs off and retries a couple times before giving up. &nbsp;Most of the time, that&#39;s enough to make the build successful, but not always.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve hit this a few times with various backup/sync tools &#8211; try building in a synced or backed up directory, you&#39;ll occasionally find you can&#39;t replace foo.exe because it&#39;s being synced at the time.</p>
<p>I am less irritated by this minor misdemeanor after finding one AV product which actually bugchecked (BSOD) the whole system any time a file was closed which had previously been opened by number. It seemed to create an internal record (the filename?) on open, then free that structure on close &#8230; no filename, no buffer, free junk, unhappytime.</p>

		<p>Previewers has been a bane of file/directory deletion, in XP. They behave better these days, though.</p>
<p>And nobody has mentioned yet the infamous &quot;disappearing source file&quot; problem in the VB6 IDE (or VB5?). Yep, that&#39;s because of some antivirus.</p>

		<p>How do you rule your Anti Virus software out if company policy does not allow (for good reasons) you to uninstall or even disable it? I had similar experiences with multi threaded file copying where during random times the copy operation did fail although no file was copied two times (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9772970/privcopyfileexw-bug-in-windows" rel="nofollow">stackoverflow.com/&#8230;/privcopyfileexw-bug-in-windows</a>). MS support told me that it was (as always) the virus scanner. But not this time. It was a bug in Windows (even the first Beta of Windows 8 still had it) since Vista. I have not tried out the latest Windows 8 build if the issue is fixed there now.</p>

		<p>If you run into this kind of thing, a trace with call stacks from either sysinternals&#39; Process Monitor or xperf/wpa (capture call the filesystem operations with call stacks) can be very illuminating. &nbsp;Call stacks are necessary since so many things run as plus-ins/add-ins and some antivirus software runs in-process by shimming all calls through to the OS that do file manipulation.</p>

		<p>Not really related (only very tightly), but why oh why was the explorer/shell behaviour changed when pressing delete with a selection of files? In older Windows&#39; (even pre XP I think) the very first thing that would always pop up was the security message &quot;Do you really want to delete &#8230;&quot;. So my fingers learned for things to delete, press delete and enter very fast after each other (to directly confirm the message)</p>
<p>Now there is a bigger delay between the time delete was pressed and the confirmation message comes up. And Explorer actually reacts on things in between. This change really bit me hard.</p>
<p>Once I got a trojan (must&#39;ve been XP pre SP2), several Britney Spears Game.exe&#39;s appeared on a few folders. So I used search to find all instances. Selected them all, pressed delete followed by enter. Yay! Delete was passed of to the shell which did godknowswhat, and the enter press started all selected instances of the trojan. While my PC was going down I saw the shell delete confirmation box come up.</p>

		<p>Older versions of the Vembu backup open file agent did this. I know because in an ironic twist it prevented Sophos Anti-Virus from updating itself! I don&#39;t see the problem with a recent version of the software, I think they switched to using volume shadow copies or something.</p>

		<p>1 &#8211; Modern anti-viruses all have exceptions implemented. Exception to files, exceptions to folders, exceptions to protocols, exceptions to whatever you dream of. If you have a predefined work area tell the anti-virus to not touch it. It really helps.</p>
<p>2 &#8211; &quot;// assume &quot;a&quot; is a large file, say, 1MB.&quot;&lt;/quote&gt;. Heck I create such &quot;large&quot; files hundreds of them each day &#8211; actually I create hundreds of 10 MB files each day. 1 MB is hardly a large file with current hardware capabilities. (anti-nitpicker comment &#8211; &lt;you use Delphi which is a poor IDE and creates large files just for the sake of it&gt;)</p>

		<p>@neil: we still have one of these systems at work (till January or so). Really great, when it randomly decides &quot;this server has seen a lot of file changes recently, better lock them all at the same time and back them up&quot; with some extra-large (&gt;1GB) files mixed in the bunch. While some user is moving directories around&#8230;</p>
<p>We asked for VSS when they last announced to do a new version. Got the answer &quot;can things slow down in some circumstances, won&#39;t do it&quot;. Yeah, sure&#8230;.</p>

		<p>@Alois: &quot;How do you rule your Anti Virus software out if company policy does not allow (for good reasons) you to uninstall or even disable it?&quot;</p>
<p>You install &lt;insert favorite PC virtualization tool name here&gt; and create one or more virtual machines (of various flavors) to test your software on.</p>

		<p>The other fun one for my group was the anti-virus that bogged everything down, but only when it was disabled. Apparently the scanning engine wouldn&#39;t shut off the &quot;drivers&quot; when it stopped listening, and the drivers would sit and wait for&#8230; something?</p>
<p>The solution was to either uninstall the AV, or never *ever* disable it. (For reasons unknown, the client had deployed AV to _almost_ all the servers, and then intentionally configured it to be disabled on specific machines. Instead of including them in the &quot;don&#39;t install&quot; list.)</p>

		<p>Question:</p>
<p>Does Microsoft work with AV vendors, to encourage them to use Oplocks? &nbsp;I know of one current corporate AV product which does exactly what Raymond posts above. &nbsp;Plus, it prevents you from ejecting USB media &quot;as it&#39;s in use&quot;.</p>

		<p>Part of the configuration detection script used to build Firefox includes autoconf macros that quickly compile and delete executables. Every so often, this fails. In January they finally gave up and added in a 1 second delay to the script. Then in May they decided that this wasn&#39;t enough and bumped it up to 2 seconds&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
