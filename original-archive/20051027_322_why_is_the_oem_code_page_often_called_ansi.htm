<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/06/29/433669.aspx"> It has been pointed out that the documentation for the cmd.exe program says </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> /A Causes the output of internal commands to a pipe or file to be ANSI </p>
</blockquote>
<p> even though the output is actually in the OEM code page. Why do errors such as this persist? </p>
<p> Because ANSI sometimes means OEM. </p>
<p> The "A" versions of the console functions accept characters in the OEM code page despite the "A" suffix that would suggest ANSI. What's more, if you call the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/fileio/fs/setfileapistooem.asp"> <code>SetFileAPIsToOEM</code> function</a>, then "A" functions that accept file names will also interpret the filenames in the OEM code page rather than the ANSI code page. </p>
<p> "There are two types of people in the world: Those who believe that the world can be divided into two types of people, and those who do not." </p>
<p> There are those who mentally divide the world of characters into two groups:  Unicode and 8-bit. And as you can see, many of them were involved in the original design of Win32. There are "W" functions (Unicode) and "A" functions (ANSI). There are no "O" functions (OEM). Instead, the OEM folks got lumped in with the ANSI folks. </p>
<p> There are also those who realize the distinction, but out of laziness or convenience often use "ANSI" as an abbreviation for "an appropriate 8-bit character set, determined from context". In the context of console programming, the appropriate 8-bit character set is the OEM character set. </p>
<p> The person who wrote the online help for cmd.exe clearly meant ANSI to mean "That thing that isn't Unicode." </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> /A Causes the output of internal commands to a pipe or file to be ANSI<br> /U Causes the output of internal commands to a pipe or file to be         Unicode </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I'll leave you to decide whether this author belongs to the "Everything is either Unicode or ANSI" camp or the "just being casual" camp.</p>

		<p>I think the help is at least confusing.</p>
<p>See also <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/06/29/433669.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/06/29/433669.aspx</a></p>
<p>What I think it would be the right thing to do: change the help to say OEM and add an extra switch to produce &quot;real&quot; ANSI.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s hope Monad will come and fix everything :-)<br /></p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not as if &quot;ANSI&quot; or &quot;OEM&quot; mean what they say, anyway. It would perhaps be more accurate to say that the &quot;ANSI&quot; APIs deal with byte strings. Then call the &quot;ANSI&quot; and &quot;OEM&quot; code pages the &quot;default&quot; and &quot;DOS-compatible&quot; code pages respectively, or something. Though I realise this is not going to happen, because when it comes to the details, backward compatibility always trumps usability.</p>

		<p>&quot;Everything is Unicode.&quot;</p>
<p>I hear that. ASCII, ISO 8859-1 and codepage 1252 are just poor encodings of Unicode that, like UCS-2, are restricted to a subset of the full range. Maybe Microsoft can bend the &quot;no changes to existing code pages&quot; rule one more time to squeeze in a Byte Order Mark and make it official.<br /></p>

		<p>The next question is, what IS the ansi code page?</p>
<p>Articles like this imply there is just one true ANSI codepag &#8211; which I thought was the case until string conversion problems on far east systems led me to discover GetACP and its implications.</p>

		<p>&gt; The person who wrote the online help for<br />
<br />&gt; cmd.exe clearly meant ANSI to mean &quot;That<br />
<br />&gt; thing that isn&#8217;t Unicode.&quot; </p>
<p>Which means that the person who wrote the online help didn&#8217;t know what he/she meant, since there are two[*] of those things that aren&#8217;t Unicode, and how can we know which of those two is &quot;that thing&quot;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the posted evidence makes it pretty obvious that the help does need fixing.</p>
<p>[* Though in Microsoft&#8217;s Japanese code pages and maybe some others, there&#8217;s only one.]</p>

		<p>Since everything is Unicode (c&#8217;mon people, it&#8217;s been around for 15 years now), I propose that the terminal &#8216;A&#8217; in function names be redefined to mean &#8216;Archaic character representation&#8217;.<br /></p>

<br />&gt; The next question is, what IS the ansi code<br />
<br />&gt; page? </p>
<p>Depending on your needs at the moment, it could be the one specified in a particular function call, it could be the one that was most recently set for the active thread, it could be the one that the user has set as their default, it could be the one that the administrator has set as the machine&#8217;s default, or it could be the one that Microsoft set as the default for whichever language version of Windows they put in the package.</p>
<p>&gt; Articles like this imply there is just one<br />
<br />&gt; true ANSI codepag</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just one of interest at the moment when a program is calling for a conversion to or from Unicode, or writing to a DOS window, etc.</p>
<p>There are two of interest at a moment when a program is calling for a conversion from one code page to another, if that&#8217;s possible.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a list of interest at a moment when a program is presenting a list for the user to choose from.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
