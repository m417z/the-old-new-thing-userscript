<p>Do you know where I can find a list of all the places the exhibition is being held?  I see several cities on the Web, but no single list.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d never stopped to think that literally any move-able, inanimate, object (aswell as rock bands) could effectively go on a world tour.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s been dissected to death too. :)  Sure, you can watch the Dead Sea Scrolls and be all romantic about it, but there&#8217;s nothing it can give a rational being, except a story to tell other people.  If one wants to study it one could get the annotated translation in English.  Now, as for the basis of it all, one can trace history back to its earliest roots and discover that the origin of all religion is a combination of mushrooms, astrotheology and the normal imperialistic quest for power.  All change happens in waves throughout history; we are currently experiencing the Era of Intellectual Property, Ownership of Thought, not unlike what the catholic church wanted to control.</p>

		<p>Raymond II, if you think that Jesus is a combination of mushrooms, astrotheology, and the normal imperialistic quest for power, the short answer is you are wrong.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d love to see these myself.  I&#8217;m not really interested in the Religious aspect, so much as age and archaeological significance.</p>
<p>You see so many movies that use Aramaic as a basis for religious validity.  It would be very cool to actually look at the language on an old scroll.</p>

		<p>To Jay B: The scrolls are not in Aramaic, but rather in Hebrew. The amazing thing is how little the language and writing have changed in 2000 years; if you have a Hebrew-speaking friend you can ask her to read the scrolls for you.</p>

		<p>According to the link in Raymond&#8217;s post: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://pacsci.org/dss/whataredss.html" rel="nofollow">http://pacsci.org/dss/whataredss.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;They are primarily in Hebrew and Aramaic. The discovery of the Scrolls has greatly enhanced our knowledge of these two languages.&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe they&#8217;re incorrect. I was going by what I read there.</p>

		<p>This might be a good place to mention the Open Scrolls Project, at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.openscrolls.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.openscrolls.org/</a><br />
<br />If you read Hebrew and write English, you can help create an open, searchable translation of the scrolls to English.</p>

		<p>Wow&#8230; I did a google search for &quot;Aramaic in Movies&quot; and I got a link to this cool feature:<br />
<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Languages/Aramaic/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Languages/Aramaic/</a></p>
<p>Fallen, Stigmata, Passion of Christ are 3 of the more notable.  I have seen others that reference Aramaic, rather than contain verbal Aramiac.</p>

		<p>Raymond II, Lance Fisher was as wrong in his description about you as you are of the scrolls. In short, you are actually a brainwashed, head in the sand, half twit. Open your eyes and expand your learning, you moron.<br />
<br />Napoleon Bonaparte: &quot;History is a set of lies agreed upon.&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
