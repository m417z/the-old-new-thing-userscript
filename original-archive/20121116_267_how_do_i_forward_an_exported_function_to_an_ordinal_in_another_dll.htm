<p>
The syntax for specifying that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/02/04/7439592.aspx">
requests to import a function from your
DLL should be forwarded to another DLL</a>
is
</p>
<pre>
; A.DEF
EXPORTS
 Dial = B.Call
</pre>
<p>
This says that if somebody tries to call <code>Dial()</code> from
<code>A.DLL</code>,
they are really calling <code>Call()</code> in <code>B.DLL</code>.
This forwarding is done in the loader.
Normally,
when a client links to the function
<code>A!Dial</code>,
the loader says,
"Okay, let me get the address of the <code>Dial</code> function
in <code>A.DLL</code> and
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/21/673830.aspx">
store it into the
<code>__imp__Dial</code> variable</a>."
It's the logical equivalent of
</p>
<pre>
client::__imp__Dial = GetProcAddress(hinstA, "Dial");
</pre>
<p>
When you use a forwarder,
the loader sees the forwarder entry and says,
"Whoa, I'm not actually supposed to get the function from <code>A.DLL</code>
at all!
I'm supposed to get the function <code>Call</code> from <code>B.DLL</code>!"
So it loads <code>B.DLL</code> and gets the function
<code>Call</code> from it.
</p>
<pre>
hinstB = LoadLibrary("B.DLL");
client::__imp__Dial = GetProcAddress(B, "Call");
</pre>
<p>
(Of course, the loader doesn't actually do it this way,
but this is a good way of thinking about it.)
</p>
<p>
But what if the function <code>Call</code> was exported by ordinal?
How do you tell the linker,
"Please create a forwarder entry for <code>Dial</code> that forwards
to function 42 in <code>B.DLL</code>?"
</p>
<p>
I didn't know, but I was able to guess.
</p>
<p>
Back in the days of 16-bit Windows, there were two ways to obtain
the address of a function exported by ordinal.
The first way is the way most people are familiar with:
</p>
<pre>
FARPROC fp = GetProcAddress(hinst, MAKEINTRESOURCE(42));
</pre>
<p>
The second way uses an alternate formulation,
passing the desired ordinal as a string prefixed with the number-sign:
</p>
<pre>
FARPROC fp = GetProcAddress(hinst, "#42");
</pre>
<p>
You can hide a number inside a string by using
<code>MAKEINTRESOURCE</code>,
and you can hide a string inside a number by using the '#' character.
</p>
<p>
Given that the number sign has been used in the past to hide
a number inside a string,
I figured it was worth a shot to see if the loader carried this
convention forward.
(No pun intended.)
</p>
<pre>
; A.DEF
EXPORTS
 Dial = B.#1
</pre>
<p>
Hey, check it out. It works.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes a little knowledge of history actually helps you solve
problems in the present day.</p>

		<p>@parkrrr, He&#39;s depending on compiler internals rather than Windows internals. Having read the PE spec, I can see this will continue to work on newer versions of Windows. I have no idea if this will work on newer versions of compilers and I&#39;d wager Raymond doesn&#39;t either. (You&#39;ll notice on recompile if this gets broken in a newer compiler version.)</p>

		<p>@Parkrrrr: That&#39;s true when someone uses an undocumented/abusive method to achieve something, but in this case the &quot;#x&quot; method is documented (at least it was in Win16, and Windows is known for its back-compat). Doing some digging, I did find a VS6 doc page that uses this format for specifying ordinals: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa264882%28v=vs.60%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/aa264882%28v=vs.60%29.aspx</a></p>

		<p>Whether this specific behavior is documented or not is beside the point, really.</p>
<p>If you discovered something works (on at least one computer, in at least one test case, for at least one sheep in Scotland who is black on at least one side) by writing the code and seeing what it did, two things are possible. Either you&#39;ve discovered undocumented behavior, or you&#39;ve discovered documented behavior but don&#39;t know that you have. Short of looking for the documentation, you have no way to know whether you&#39;re in the &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;okay&quot; case. So you should check the documentation to make sure. But since that&#39;s the case, why not just check the documentation first?</p>

		<p>Failure to find documentation does not mean documentation does not exist. &nbsp;You can prove that something is documented. &nbsp;You cannot prove that something is not documented (unless explicitly documented as being undocumented). &nbsp;Of course if you A) assume everything is undocumented by default and B) do not rely on undocumented behavior then you will be safe.</p>

		<p>@640k: Indeed.</p>
<p>In a recent question asked in MS forums, someone called Control.Invoke() and meet &quot;Invoke or BeginInvoke cannot be called on a control until the window handle has been created.&quot; exception, and doesn&#39;t know what to do.</p>
<p>In fact, there&#39;s a line in Remarks section of Control.InvokeRequired property tell you that you should also check for Control.IsHandleCreated if it&#39;ll be run at a place you&#39;re not sure whether target window is created.</p>
<p>That line does not exist on the Control.Invoke() page itself.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
