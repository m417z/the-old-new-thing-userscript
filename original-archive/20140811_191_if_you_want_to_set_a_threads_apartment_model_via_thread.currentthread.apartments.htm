<p>
Welcome to CLR Week 2014.
Don't worry, it'll be over in a few days.
</p>
<p>
A customer wanted to know why their
<code>Folder&shy;Browser&shy;Dialog</code>
was displaying the infamous
<i>Current thread must be set to single thread apartment (STA) mode
before OLE calls can be made</i> error.
</p>
<pre>
private void btnBrowseFolder_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
  Thread.CurrentThread.ApartmentState = ApartmentState.STA;
  FolderBrowserDialog fbd = new FolderBrowserDialog {
    RootFolder = System.Environment.SpecialFolder.MyComputer,
    ShowNewFolderButton = true,
    Description = "Select the awesome folder..."
  };
  DialogResult dr = fbd.ShowDialog();
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>
"Even though we set the
<code>Apartment&shy;State</code> to <code>STA</code>,
the apartment state is still <code>MTA</code>.
Curiously, if we put the above code in a standalone
test program, it works fine."
</p>
<p>
The problem is that the customer is changing the apartment
state too late.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
On the first call to unmanaged code,
the runtime calls <b>Co&shy;Initialize&shy;Ex</b>
to initialize the COM apartment as either an MTA or an STA apartment.
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5s8ee185%28v=vs.71%29.aspx">
You can control the type of apartment created</a>
by setting the
System.Threading.ApartmentState property on the thread to <b>MTA</b>,
<b>STA</b>, or <b>Unknown</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice that the value you specify in
<code>Current&shy;Thread.<wbr>Apartment&shy;State</code>
is consulted at the point the runtime initializes the COM apartment
(which occurs on the first call to unmanaged code).
If you change it after the COM apartment has been initialized,
you're revising the blueprints of a house after it has been built.
</p>
<p>
The standard way to avoid this problem is to attach the
<code>[STAThread]</code> attribute to your <code>Main</code>
function,
or if you need to set the apartment model of a thread
you created yourself,
call the
<code>Thread.<wbr>Set&shy;Apartment&shy;State</code> method
before the thread starts.</p>

		<p>I wonder if a universal wrapper could be made so that anybody requesting an STA on an MTA or free thread can get the wrapper and work. Every example I&#39;ve seen boiled down to calling DialogBox in an MTA thread which seems like it could be safe.</p>

		<p>This could/should be fixed in SHBrowseForFolder. It should be pretty simple: if (!IsCurrentThreadSTA()) { SHCreateThreadWithHandle(CTF_COINIT_STA, DoSHBrowseForFolder, pbi); WaitForSingleObject(&#8230;); return ..; } else return DoSHBrowseForFolder(pbi);</p>

		<p>@Anon, after the fact, and if anyone on the interwebs ever cares to publish an analysis and fix or workaround, you might spend at most two minutes looking the error up, and it might be the same error, and it might describe the specific cause or a series of causes, and one of the suggestions might actually work (you still have to try them out).</p>
<p>Or not, for each might. &nbsp;Alas, these are the infamous errors where the description might not help. &nbsp;If you know COM, this description will make perfect sense. &nbsp;If you don&#39;t, you may ask &quot;WTH is an apartment, aren&#39;t domains enough?&quot;, Of Courseâ„¢, one thing having little or nothing to do with the other.</p>
<p>There went two minutes, who knows how many more&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;On the first call to unmanaged code, the runtime calls CoÂ­InitializeÂ­Ex to initialize the COM apartment as either an MTA or an STA apartment.&quot;</p>
<p>Does it do it even if you don&#39;t deal with COM at all and call native code through a P/Invoke?</p>

		<p>@Raymond: I don&#39;t know what kind of system setting you are talking about. As far as thread affinity goes, MSDN does not say anything about which thread the callback is called from but most people probably assume it is the same thread. If a MTA workaround was added it could just say that it is undefined which thread the callback is called from when the caller was MTA.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Anything that triggers a broadcast. And you yourself noted that most people assume that it is the same thread. Adding an MTA workaround would therefore break people who made that assumption. And all this to work around something that is against best practice anyway (doing UI from an MTA thread). -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>[Try changing a system setting while the dialog box is up.]</p>
<p>My point about the Msg version.</p>
<p>[Or try doing anything with thread affinity in the browse dialog callback. -Raymond]</p>
<p>I could fix that in half a day by invoking the call back to the initiating thread. I&#39;ve written similar things before. To be fair I didn&#39;t know this dialog had a callback until just now. I&#39;ve never needed it.</p>
<p>[(doing UI from an MTA thread). -Raymond]</p>
<p>If it&#39;s an MTA client (as opposed to server) thread, there should be no problem with it. Artificiality creating a thread to satisfy an assertion is silly.</p>

		<p>OK so that fix doesn&#39;t work. Yet the lack of a fix seems unreasonable. Being able to create, use, and finally discard single threaded objects within the lifetime of a single message to a multi-threaded server should be the NORMAL case not the strange difficult case.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>(1) That single-threaded object may in turn create other single-threaded objects. And how can you prove that the object is discarded before the call returns? Maybe somebody passed a reference to a background thread, or cached it in a thread-local object. (2) Doing UI from an MTA thread is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/24/8420242.aspx">explicitly a bad idea</a>.

		<p>@Raymond: MSDN says this about MTA callers: &quot;&#8230; SHBrowseForFolder fails if the calling application uses the BIF_USENEWUI or BIF_NEWDIALOGSTYLE flag&#8230;&quot; so how would this break existing code? Or you could add a new BIF_* flag for MTA callers. Win32 is dead so it is not going to happen but it would have been nice 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Basically, any API that shows a dialog can get this MTA issue in the future. Imagine this; the dialog created by ChooseFont() gets new buttons to save and load custom colors or to load a color from a palette file. You would end up calling GetOpenFileName which hosts shell extensions that expect to be called from a STA thread&#8230;</p>
<div class="post">[<em>How would changing behavior break existing code? Because you&#39;re changing behavior. There would need to be a new BIF_* flag, but if you need to change your code to get the altered behavior, you may as well change your code to do the helper thread. So there&#39;s no real value added aside from convenience. -Raymond</em>]</div>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
