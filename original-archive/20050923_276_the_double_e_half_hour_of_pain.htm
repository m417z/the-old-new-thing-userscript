<p>I'm pretty confident I'm going to regret this.</p>
<p> I have been goaded into <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2005/09/20/471844.aspx"> The Double-E Half Hour of Pain</a>, featuring <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/"> Eric Gunnerson</a> and <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/fatcyclist/Blog/"> The Fat Cyclist</a>. Indeed, Mr.&nbsp;Cyclist has <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/fatcyclist/Blog/cns!1pUmGvi9idWgOodsIbhHUOQA!1396.entry"> already started the trash talk</a>. </p>
<p> My strategy will be to start slow and taper off. (Especially since it will have taken me about an hour and a half just to get to the starting point.) </p>
<p> I'll be the one in the black shorts and yellow shirt, with a heavy bicycle and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/23/473270.aspx"> a withered hand</a>. (I just like saying "withered hand".) </p>

		<p>Good luck, Raymond.  I prefer the other zoo ride.  The one in Seattle.  It&#8217;s not nearly as steep.  Much more pleasant.</p>

		<p>A good hill clim race is all psychological, and you are dangerously close to playing to lose from the outset. </p>
<p>Here are some tactics</p>
<p>-ask open questions,  not questions that take answeres like yes/no/0x34fe. You want to ask a question between breaths &quot;what tyres have you been running this season&quot; or &quot;how do I consistently get the ipaddr of a laptop&quot;, where the answer will put the opponent into oxygen deprivation before they are half finished.</p>
<p>-at the corners, stand up accelerate past people and get out of sight before you sit down and die. It destroys morale. &quot;The armstrong gambit&quot;</p>
<p>-have a squeaky bike and sit at the back of the pack humming out of tune. Make no attempt to talk or attack. This is the Indurain approach. </p>
<p>-before the right, start comparing the climbs to fractions of an alpe d&#8217;huez. Or say something like &quot;you could fit six of these in before reaching the first cafe on Le Tourmalet&quot;. Dont state whether or not you&#8217;ve done these classic french climbs, just let doubt gnaw away at their self-confidence.</p>
<p>-look pleased at the start of ever steep bit</p>
<p>-try and actually enjoy it. it is meant to hurt, otherwise you aren&#8217;t doing it right.</p>
<p>Steve &#8216;20% gradient is where the fun begins&#8217; Loughran</p>

		<p>Wow, now I feel like a real wimp for wanting to ride over this this coming weekend.</p>

		<p>Steve Loughren:</p>
<p>The best tactic</p>
<p>ride beside someone.</p>
<p>Look at them.</p>
<p>after a while. . . </p>
<p>Look at them again.</p>
<p>(repeat as necessary)</p>
<p>Then. . .</p>
<p>ask &quot;are you feelin&#8217; okay?&quot;</p>
<p>wait 10 seconds</p>
<p>put the hammer down!!!</p>
<p></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
