		<p>Does &quot;suited and booted&quot; also specify a type of footwear? Or are they using &quot;booted&quot; in the computing sense?</p>
<p>Come to think of it, since I hear the trunk of a car is called &quot;boot&quot; in the UK, perhaps it refers to the fact that with some hackers it would take being kidnapped and stuffed in the trunk to get them to put on a suit&#8230;</p>

		<p>Someone You Know,</p>
<p>Seriously. &nbsp;Do you really need to ask what type of footwear goes with a suit? &nbsp;I know engineers don&#8217;t have a lot of fashion sense, but c&#8217;mon!</p>
<p>To me, the &quot;booted&quot; part seems like saying &quot;dress nice from head to toe&quot;. &nbsp;Look good all the way down to your &quot;boots&quot;.</p>
<p>I was thinking it could have originally been military slang, but a quick search on wikipedia shows that it&#8217;s a Snoop Dogg song.</p>

		<p>&quot;Suited and booted&quot; is a general English phrase to mean wearing your Sunday best. I think it&#8217;s quite an old phrase hence the reference to boots.</p>
<p>At MS UK, customer visits are nearly always business casual but if that customer comes to TVP then Microsoft casual is fair game so I guess it&#8217;s more about the location than the customer.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d like to think someone, somewhere tried to use Google for this.</p>
<p>The first definition it finds is from Urban Dictionary: &quot;All dressed up, most likely in a purple suit, purple shoes, purple hat, big shades, rolly bling, bling teeth, and cane.&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d never heard the phrase &quot;suited and booted&quot; before â€” guess you learn something new every day.</p>
<p>I was thinking it was some kind of clever pun on the word &quot;boot&quot;, i.e. that consultants should be both properly attired (&quot;suited&quot;) and awake/caffeinated (&quot;booted&quot;) for client visits.</p>

		<p>At all of the companies I have worked, dress code does not seem to apply to the women. My favorite is when we need to dress up and you have ladies who show up in a track suit.</p>

		<p>It is common practice in English Public schools ( as opposed to State schools, see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_school" rel="nofollow">http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_school</a> ) to have terminology for each &#8216;grade&#8217; of required attire, or at least it was when I was at school.</p>
<p>Typically the grades would be &#8216;best&#8217;, &#8216;smart&#8217;, &#8216;smart casual&#8217;, &#8216;casual&#8217; but colloquially &#8216;best&#8217; was referred to as Sunday Best, &#8216;smart&#8217; as Suited &amp; Booted and &#8216;casual&#8217; as Sloppies. Boys will be boys &#8230; Oddly, &#8216;smart casual&#8217; had no colloquialism that I am aware of.</p>
<p>For example, when we had the Queen visit for the School Quatercentenary, we got instructions to dress in &#8216;best&#8217;, naturally.</p>
<p>As a boarder, you would even get a School List setting out what was expected in each category, including what was to be bought at the School Shop.</p>
<p>I would not be surprised if the practice was exported to other private and &#8216;preparatory&#8217; schools around the world that sought to emulate the English system, including in the US.</p>

		<p>&quot;Suited and booted&quot; is a British term for sure. I&#8217;ve been hearing that in India from my Grandfather (who picked it from the British rule era).</p>

		<p>I like to say that it&#8217;s a choice between being competent or dressing up. If you can do one, you don&#8217;t need to do the other. ;-) Oh, and I&#8217;m definitely somewhere below &quot;MS casual&quot; &#8211; I work from home almost exclusively. No pants&#8230;</p>

		<p>DaveK: Yes, well. &nbsp;Regardless of whether the company gets to &quot;dictate&quot; such things, when I&#8217;m representing my company (or, for that matter, myself) to others, I prefer to do a good job of it. &nbsp;And that includes dressing appropriately, which on some occasions has required my asking the company for guidance on what&#8217;s considered appropriate.</p>
<p>Whether this explains the fact that my everyday dress involves a collared polo shirt (and, yes, Morten, it includes pants too!), despite my working from home, is perhaps best left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

		<p>AaronG &gt; So &quot;suited and booted&quot; means &quot;suit&quot;. &nbsp;Another victory for the Department of Redundancy Department.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say for the Ministry of Pun-ditry, meself. I enjoy a good bit of linguistic whimsy. (But then, I&#8217;m a Perl fan, therefore hopeless re sensible language&#8230;)</p>
<p>Aside from rhyme or alliteration (alliteration is the car to rhyme&#8217;s cdr), the connotational overloads of this ancient phrase in this context delight me: &quot;suit&quot; as &quot;appropriate to the occasion&quot;, &quot;boot&quot; as &quot;freshly initialized and running&quot;&#8230;</p>
<p>(Although I admit that Someone&#8217;s hint of &quot;developer in trunk&quot; has me worried&#8230;)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
