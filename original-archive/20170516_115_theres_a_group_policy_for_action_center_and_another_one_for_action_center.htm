<p>
A customer
wanted to know how to disable the Action Center,
the control panel that lets you access settings
for the firewall, SmartScreen, that sort of thing.
The reason is that the customer is developing
a locked-down system with a fixed set of
applications,
and they want to disable notifications about
the settings that are locked down,
since there's no point informing the user
about something they can't do anything about.
(And risk the change the user will try to "fix"
the issue and just make things worse.)
</p>
<p>
Okay, well, before we can answer the question,
let's get some terminology straight.
</p>
<p>
There have been multiple features in Windows
that have gone by the name "Action Center".
In Windows&nbsp;7
and Windows&nbsp;8,
Action Center was the name for
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/e7/2008/11/11/action-center/">
the thing that gives you quick access
to firewall and other security settings</a>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Windows Phone 8.1 introduced
its own concept also called "Action Center".
It provided quick access to a few system settings,
as well as gathering all your recent notifications.
</p>
<p>
Windows&nbsp;10 brought
the Windows Phone Action Center to the desktop,
and the old Action Center was renamed
"Security and Maintenance Center".
</p>
<p>
This means that when you say "Action Center",
different people will hear the phrase and think
of different things.
</p>
<p>
The customer who asked about disabling
the Action Center was asking about the Windows&nbsp;8
Action Center,
as confirmed not only by their description of its contents,
but also by a screen shot included with the question.
If that's what you want to disable, then you can use
<a HREF="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee617161(v=ws.10).aspx">
the group policy called "Remove the Action Center icon</a>".
(This policy was renamed to
"Remove the Security and Maintenance icon" in Windows&nbsp;10.)
</p>
<p>
The customer replied,
"But if we disable that, then will the user
be able to toggle Wi-Fi or Tablet Mode?"
</p>
<p>
Okay, now the customer changed gears and is
now asking about the Windows&nbsp;10 Action Center.
</p>
<p>
If you want to disable the Windows&nbsp;10 Action Center,
then the policy you want is called
"Remove Notifications and Action Center."
</p>
<p>
I apologize for the confusion.
This is what happens when Marketing chooses the names
of things:
They see a cool name and decide to reuse it.
This happened before with
<i>Surface</i>,
which used to refer to the table-sized device,
but now refers to a line of PC tablets and laptops
(and
<a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-surface-hub/">
these giant wall-sized things</a>)
and the old table-sized devices are
now called <i>PixelSense</i>.
Earlier, it happened with Access,
which
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060413-09/?p=31543">
used to refer to a terminal emulator program</a>
but now refers to a database program.
</p>
<p>
At least the engineering team recognizes the importance
of not reusing names.
That's why
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040122-00/?p=40963">
there is no DirectX&nbsp;4</a>.</p>

		<p>Don&#8217;t blame Marketing completely. It&#8217;s also Legal with trademark rights. You come up with a name, some other company sees big bucks and sues, and lots of money is spent on lawyers, and you potentially have to rename your product after you spent millions in marketing. The risk is reduced with a trademark that&#8217;s already been used for a while either by you or by somebody you buy the rights from.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
