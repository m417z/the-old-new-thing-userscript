<p>
If you see a long line of people waiting for a phone booth
(note: this analogy assumes you remember how phone booths work),
and you want to understand the reason for the long line,
do you
</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to a person waiting in line and begin your investigation there?
<li>Go to the phone booth (and the person inside)
    and begin your investigation there?
</ul>
<p>
If there is a long line of people waiting for a single resource,
a resource that there is not normally a long line for,
you would probably look at the person who is using the resource
to see if, for example, they are a chatterbox who will be on
the phone for an hour, or if the phone is being repaired
or is otherwise not working properly.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, if you find that in your 20-thread program, 17 of
them are waiting for a single critical section,
then you probably want to investigate the thread that owns the
critical section to see whether (and why) it isn't releasing it.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
When testing a program, I encountered a hang that occurred
after doing&nbsp;X.
There are a few threads stuck in <code>LoadLibrary</code>,
and about 40 threads stuck here:
</p>
<pre>
ntdll!KiFastSystemCallRet
ntdll!ZwWaitForSingleObject+0xc
ntdll!RtlpWaitForCriticalSection+0x132
ntdll!RtlEnterCriticalSection+0x46
ntdll!_LdrpInitialize+0xf0
ntdll!KiUserApcDispatcher+0x7
</pre>
<p>
Here is one of the threads that is stuck in
<code>LoadLibrary</code> [stack trace deleted].
You seem to be one of the people who work on the
component that is trying to load the library.
Can you investigate why the program is stuck?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This person picked one of the people waiting in line
and decided that they were the ones responsible for
the problem.
But if course, that person waiting in line is just
another victim of the person at the head of the line
who is hogging the critical section.
In this case, the critical section is the infamous
<i>loader lock</i>.
That it's the loader lock is obvious from the symptoms:
What critical section
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/09/04/4731478.aspx">
does every thread require when it starts up</a>?
What critical section does <code>LoadLibrary</code> require?
</p>
<p>
You can use the <code>!critsec</code> debugger command to
identify the current owner of the loader lock,
and then start studying that thread to see what the hold-up is.
</p>
<p>
Note that I'm not saying that the thread that owns the resource
is necessarily the culprit.
The problem could be in the resource itself,
or it could be in
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/12/1266392.aspx">
the pattern of usage associated with that resource</a>.
But starting your investigation
with the owner of the resource is a good bet,
because most of the time, the reason for the long wait queue
is that the current owner of the resource isn't releasing it.</p>

		<p>You&#8217;ll often see this same phenomenon at the self-checkout at grocery stores.</p>
<p>The chief culprit, I find, are the people that want to purchase vegetables. Instead of printing an easily scannable bar code, the patron needs to use the fallback method of paging through a large list of on-screen items to find the vegetable they&#8217;re trying to buy.</p>
<p>I can never decide if that&#8217;s an example of a leaky abstraction (since the machine deals only in bar codes and weights, not &#8216;carrots&#8217; or &#8216;oranges&#8217;) or a case of backward compatibility hampering advancement.</p>
<p>Can you tell I spent a lot of time in self-checkout lines?</p>

		<p>&quot;then you probably want to investigate the thread that owns the critical section&quot; &#8211; no, I&#8217;d immediately write an ill thought out, bile-ridden blog entry explaining how broken Vista was and how this just wouldn&#8217;t happen if we used cloud computing for everything ever. And I bet it&#8217;s just as broken in Windows 7, whatever it is.</p>

		<p>@benjamin: This is why the scales should be near the veg, rather than at the self checkout line. It saves time at the normal checkouts too, and scales can be hung over the veg in order to increase parallelism.</p>

		<p>@Owen S: there usually are such scales, but the customer doesn&#8217;t think to use them at the point of choosing the veg, only weighing at the end.</p>
<p>The industry&#8217;s response is to define a more compact barcode symbology &#8211; now called DataBar, previously known as Reduced Space Symbology (RSS) &#8211; so that each piece of fruit or veg can have a small sticky label attached that indicates its product code. Unfortunately retailers don&#8217;t have to have implemented it for another five years.</p>
<p>The UPC/EAN barcode format is 35 years old, so it&#8217;s stood up pretty well. It still works extremely well, even better when the barcodes are printed with the right dimensions, good contrast, and not likely to be damaged. My local supermarket at home has some pasta in shrink-wrap packaging where the seal of the package commonly obscures the barcode; at work, the sandwiches are barcoded but the label material is wrong for the laser printer they&#8217;re using and the toner doesn&#8217;t stick properly, so the bars fall off &#8211; they&#8217;re also too small so almost any damage leads to a no-decode.</p>
<p>For more on DataBar, see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://gs1.org/barcodes/databar" rel="nofollow">http://gs1.org/barcodes/databar</a></p>

<p>&quot;You seem to be one of the people who work on the component that is trying to load the library. Can you investigate why the program is stuck?&quot;</p>
<p>It means that the guy wants someone else (i.e someone else waiting in line) to do the dirty digging.</p>

<p>The tricky thing is that you need to have an idea of what you are looking for. Like most any command in WinDBG, if you poke around, you&#8217;ll find something to say aha to, but it probably isn&#8217;t your problem.</p>

		<p>@Mike Dimmick: @benjamin:</p>
<p>Actually, instead of pawing through the list of fruit and vegetables, on the databar sticker (or the sticker period, if you have fruit without databar), there&#8217;s 4-digit number. Surprisingly, it&#8217;s the PLU code for that fruit or vegetable!</p>
<p>(And the bottom barcode reader is also a scale.).</p>
<p>Save yourself the lookup time and just use those 4 digits and you won&#8217;t go wrong. Unless you mix the fruits into one bag&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
