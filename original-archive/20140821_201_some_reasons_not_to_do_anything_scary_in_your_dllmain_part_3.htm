<p>In the same week, the shell team was asked to investigate two failures.</p>
<p> The first one was a deadlock in Explorer. The participating threads look like this: </p>
<ul>
<li>Thread&nbsp;1 called <code>Free&shy;Library</code> on a shell extension     as part of normal     <code>Co&shy;Free&shy;Unused&shy;Libraries</code> processing.     That DLL called <code>Ole&shy;Uninitialize</code>     from its <code>Dll&shy;Main</code> function.     This thread blocked because the COM lock was held by thread&nbsp;2. </li>
<li>Thread&nbsp;2 called <code>Co&shy;Create&shy;Instance</code>,     and COM tried to load the DLL which handles the object,     but the thread blocked because the loader lock was held     by thread&nbsp;1. </li>
</ul>
<p> The shell extension caused this problem because it ignored the rule against calling shell and COM functions from the <code>Dll&shy;Main</code> entry point, as specifically called out in the <code>Dll&shy;Main</code> documentation as examples of functions that should not be called. </p>
<p> The authors of this shell extension may never have caught this problem in their internal testing (or if they did they didn't understand what it meant) because hitting this deadlock requires that a race window be hit: The shell extension DLL needs to be unloaded on one thread at the exact same moment another thread is inside the COM global lock trying to load another DLL. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, another failure was traced back to a DLL calling <code>Co&shy;Initialize</code> from their <code>Dll&shy;Main</code>. This extra COM initialization count means that when the thread called <code>Co&shy;Uninitialize</code> thinking that it was uninitializing COM, it actually merely decremented the count to&nbsp;1. The code then proceeded to do things that are not allowed in a single-threaded apartment, believing that it had already torn down the apartment. But the secret <code>Co&shy;Initialize</code> performed by the shell extension violated that assumption. Result: A thread that stopped responding to messages. </p>
<p> The authors of both of these shell extensions seemed be calling <code>Co&shy;Uninitialize</code>/<wbr><code>Ole&shy;Uninitialize</code> in order to cancel out a <code>Co&shy;Initialize</code>/<wbr><code>Ole&shy;Initialize</code> which they performed in their <code>DLL_<wbr>PROCESS_<wbr>ATTACH</wbr></wbr></code>. This is fundamentally unsound not only because of the general rule of not calling COM functions inside <code>Dll&shy;Main</code> but also because OLE initialization is a per-thread state, whereas <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/26/9804500.aspx"> the thread that gets the <code>DLL_<wbr>PROCESS_<wbr>DETACH</wbr></wbr></code> notification is not necessarily the one that receives the <code>DLL_<wbr>PROCESS_<wbr>ATTACH</wbr></wbr></code> notification</a>. </wbr></wbr></p>
<p> It so happens that in the second case, the DLL in question was a shell copy hook, and the hang was occuring not in Explorer but in an application which was using <code>SH&shy;File&shy;Operation</code> to delete some files. We could at least advise the application authors to pass the <code>FOFX_<wbr>NO&shy;COPY&shy;HOOKS</wbr></code> flag to <code>IFile&shy;Operation::<wbr>Set&shy;Operation&shy;Flags</wbr></code> to prevent copy hooks from being loaded. </p>

		<p>Why did these extensions even need to call CoÂ­Initialize in the first place? COM should already be initialized by the host process before calling CoÂ­CreateÂ­Instance to load the extension (Unless they are running on Win95 and the extension is registered to run without COM).</p>

		<p>The funny thing is, I&#39;ve never in my life had any reason (that I know of) to implement a DllMain at all &#8211; literally not even once. I like to keep things simple, which means I avoid COM like the plague, so that&#39;s probably part of it. &nbsp;The more of these articles I read, the more convinced I am that avoiding COM is the right thing to do.</p>

		<p>In older times there were checked builds of Windows where developers could in theory find out about problems in their apps. &nbsp;What is the current best practise for this sort of thing? &nbsp;It looks like checked builds no longer happen, not that too many used them anyway. &nbsp;The Windows Application Verifier also seems to not be too current. &nbsp;Would it have caught this issue?</p>

		<p>@MV, I suspect you mean you&#39;ve never written a fake DllMain. &nbsp;Almost certainly your toolchain implements the real DLL entry-point (which has no name; it&#39;s identified by its address stored in the PE header), which in addition to calling the function having the name DllMain which you chose not to provide, also performs construction and initialization of global variables.</p>

		<p>As a primarily managed-code developer who has nonetheless read this blog for many years and seen lots of &quot;what *not* to do in DllMain&quot;, I&#39;d like to ask: broadly speaking, what kinds of things *is* it appropriate to do in DllMain?</p>

		<p>@MV: Completely agrees that when writing small tools, static linking makes more sense than dynamic linking.</p>
<p>However, talking about &quot;not linked to .NET runtimes in order to avoid DLL hell&quot; as advantage is silly, it sounds as if you don&#39;t want to call Windows system DLL altogether.</p>

		<p>@Ben, yes, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re right. &nbsp;I&#39;m mostly talking C++, so there&#39;s definitely some initialization that has to happen when the DLL is loaded. But the toolchain handles that &#8211; and handles it correctly every time with zero effort from me, like a good toolchain should (OK, there&#39;s the order of global initialization problem, but that&#39;s not specific to DLLs, it happens just as much with EXEs). &nbsp;But there&#39;s never been anything that *I* wanted to do when one of my DLLs was being loaded or unloaded.</p>
<p>Actually, the last major project I designed, we avoided DLLs completely &#8211; we just compiled the common stuff into LIBs and then linked them directly into the EXEs. &nbsp;Sure, the EXEs were consuming excess disk space, and excess physical memory (because the common code couldn&#39;t be shared between two processes like DLLs can), but all of my EXEs together were smaller than the .NET runtime, so who cares? &nbsp;And it was *SO* worth it to stay completely out of DLL hell!</p>

		<p>@Ben Voigt The default CRT entry point does have a name, otherwise the linker wouldn&#39;t know where it was. The default name is chosen by the linker, but you can override it with /ENTRY (or /NOENTRY for a resource-only DLL).</p>

		<p>@cheong00: it was a pure C++ app (the architecture of which was cloned from a prior app which predates .NET and is still running strong), so there was really no need for .NET at all. &nbsp;Most of the EXEs were 10-20MB, and they had ZERO dependencies &#8211; just drop the EXEs onto any pc running Win2K or higher, and they&#39;d work. </p>

		<p>It sounds like DllMain is a lot like Unix signal handlers in this respect: It&#39;s a very attractive place to put fancy code yet there is very little that you can do safely. Since so few people understand that, they write all kinds of unsafe things in their DllMain (like invoke COM) or signal handlers (like allocate memory). And they get away with it too, because the race windows are so hard to hit.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: It would be *great* if there was a precise list of &quot;safe to call in DllMain&quot; Win32 API functions. That would make things simple: if you are calling anything else in your DllMain, you are wrong.</p>
<p>@MV: One useful thing to do in a DllMain: DisableThreadLibraryCalls(). Makes every CreateThread() in the whole process faster.</p>

		<p><!-- p>I wonder what is this shell extension that led to a deadlock in explorer.exe? I have received a deadlock in explorer with the June's Windows 8.1 updates :) OneDrive?


<p>Regarding DllMain, I think if you need some extra initialization, it&#39;s better to create a thread from DllMain and save its handle to a global variable, and then kill the thread on DLL_PROCESS_DETACH. That&#39;s fairly enough.</p>

		<p>@Riggs, the problem is that the other thread will be running your DLL&#39;s code, how do you kill it? &nbsp;TerminateThread will leave some things in an inconsistent state, and signaling the thread and waiting for it to exit is prone to deadlocking with the dreaded loader lock (or whatever it actually is).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
