<p> Okay, I defended the Germans last week, but this one baffles even me. Do the Germans not realize that David Hasselhoff is a joke? Er war ein unbeudentender Schauspieler in einem bl&ouml;den Fernsehprogramm.  Ihm wurde die Schau von einem Auto gestohlen! </p>
<p> (And for those who still want <a href="http://www.scifi.com/knightrider/"> their Knight Rider fix</a>, you can check out this movie of some people who <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~peter_henriksen/media/1982_toyota_camry_rc.wmv"> installed remote control hydraulics in a 1982 Toyota Camry and drove it around the desert, just like the Knight Rider title sequence</a>.) </p>

		<p>Until recently they showed reruns of Knight Rider over and over on a german TV channel. And not so long ago, another channel started to rerun Baywatch every day. He seems to have lots of fans overthere, alone because of Knight Rider.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think that David Hasselhoff is the main reason for watching Baywatch. ;o)</p>

		<p>Many Germans like David Hasselhoff just like many French people like Jerry Lewis. It may be incomprehensible for you because you weren&#8217;t there when these figures were introduced to Germany/France.</p>
<p>In addition, Hasselhoff ensured longevity through his song &quot;I&#8217;m Looking For Freedom&quot;, which was released around the time when the Wall collapsed. East Germans love the song for the symbolism they&#8217;ve projected into it.</p>
<p>(Don&#8217;t even get me started about the Pet Shop Boys&#8217; &quot;Go West&quot; which became a German anthem because it was played endlessly during soccer matches.)</p>
<p>@Sven: Women DO watch Baywatch because of David Hasselhoff&#8217;s sixpack.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
