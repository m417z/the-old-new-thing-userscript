<p>
Today's Microspeak is the verb phrase "lift up".
Here's a citation:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
[After a long detailed discussion.]
I want to lift up a little and talk about why this is important.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I didn't know what this intransitive sense of <i>lift up</i> meant,
and there wasn't too much context here to work from,
so I hunted around for other citations.
The vast majority of uses were transitive,
with the unsurprising meaning of "to raise".
But buried among the results were a few intransitive uses:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
It was useful to sit down and lift the
discussion to the Western Europe level, not just the Germany level.
This is a good way to lift up to take a broader view.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
From context, it appears that <i>lift up</i> means
"to take a higher-level view".
The next example seems to confirm this sense:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
Don't start by going into detail about the new offering.
Lift up a level and start by discussing how the new offering
fits the overall strategy.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The word <i>level</i> is not a direct object of
<i>lift up</i>;
it's telling you how much to lift up, not what to lift up.
The implication is that you are lifting <i>yourself</i>:
When you <i>lift up</i>, you are taking a higher-level view
of the situation to see how the pieces fit together.
</p>
<p>
The final citation I could find takes a somewhat different
approach to the phrase <i>lift up</i>:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
A team might be heads-down executing on their plan
and can't lift up to consider what to do next.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This contrasts <i>lift up</i> with
<a HREF="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/h/headsdown.html">
<i>heads-down</i></a>,&sup1;
and suggests that the implied direct object is <i>head</i>:
The team is so focused on executing their plan that they
can't lift up <i>their heads</i> to consider what to do next.
</p>
<p>
It appears that <i>lift up</i> means different things
depending on context.
It could mean to <i>shift the discussion to a
higher-level topic</i>,
or it could mean to
<i>disengage momentarily from an all-consuming task</i>.&sup2;
</p>
<p>
&sup1; The metaphor for <i>heads-down</i> is students hard
at work, hunched over their desk, so that their heads are
buried in their books and they are consequently unaware of
their surroundings.
</p>
<p>
&sup2; Interestingly, the first and last citations both
came from the same person,
suggesting more strongly that <i>lift up</i> has multiple
valid interpretations, and you need to pick the intended one
from context.</p>

		<p>I think you missed the mark on the last example.<br />
To &#8216;lift up&#8217; always means essentially the same thing: To shift focus to a higher level of abstraction, to zoom out, or to look at the bigger picture.</p>
<p>The sentence implies that because they are engaged in an all consuming task, they can&#8217;t shift the focus to a higher-level topic.<br />
To put another way, the shifting of focus is blocked due to their level of engagement.</p>
<p>A contrived example to illustrate this with different verb/blocking condition:<br />
Because the team is chained to their desks, they can&#8217;t walk away.<br />
Being chained doesn&#8217;t change the meaning of walk to &#8216;become momentarily unchained from their desk&#8217;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
