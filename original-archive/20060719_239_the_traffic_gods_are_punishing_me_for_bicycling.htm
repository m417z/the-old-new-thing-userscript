<p>It happened again.</p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/19/636824.aspx"> The last time I participated in a bicycle ride that started in Seattle</a>, I got stuck in highway traffic both going out and coming back. <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/traffic/2003067277_520close17m.html"> The 520 bridge was closed for inspection</a> so everybody was taking the I-90 bridge instead. But traffic at the western terminal of I-90 was backed up because the Alaska Way Viaduct was closed for some sort of fundraiser walk-a-thon. And then, after the ride was over, I got stuck in traffic on the return trip as well because the Mariners baseball game had just let out, and that on top of all the traffic created by the 520 bridge being closed. </p>
<p> This weekend, heading to the starting point for a light group ride through Seattle (which our group leader nicknamed "Crying over STP" since it coincided with the annual <a href="http://www.cascade.org/EandR/stp/">Seattle to Portland</a> bike ride), there was a huge back-up on westbound highway 520 due to a multiple-car accident that closed both main lanes, forcing everybody to squeeze into the car pool lane. And then after the ride was over, I got stuck on the 520 bridge at around 4:10pm. The flashing lights were on, indicating that the drawbridge was open. I turned in to the Department of Transportation highway radio station and learned that the bridge was scheduled to be open from 4pm to 4:30pm for "boat fair traffic". But at least we knew how long we were going to be waiting, so I turned off the car engine, got out, and walked around the bridge. (It's not often that you get to walk on the 520 bridge. It didn't occur to me to ride my bicycle on the bridge.) </p>
<p> When I got home, I tried to find any information on this scheduled closure, but turned up nothing. I guess you just had to know. </p>
<p> But at least I won't get stuck in traffic next month when <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/08/448970.aspx"> I head to Mercer Island to watch the Blue Angels perform</a>, because I'm going to ride my bicycle there. We'll see whether the hills have returned. </p>
<p> <b>Postscript&nbsp;1</b>: And I hadn't known about the Elliot Bay Trail, which runs from the marina, through the trainyards, along the waterfront, to downtown Seattle. Very nice. </p>
<p> <b>Postscript&nbsp;2</b>: You can still see the after-effects of that accident on highway 520: The light barriers on the median near Hunts Point have all been scraped off! </p>
<p> <b>Postscript&nbsp;3</b>: We stopped for lunch at the Elliott Bay Marina, looking for the <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/food/restaurants/sanmisushi.php"> the sushi place that we dimly remembered</a>, but it turns out that they no longer exist. (We had lunch at Maggie Bluff's Grill instead.) Sushi is a somewhat unorthodox bicycle food; I amused myself with the image of a support car driving up to a rider and handing over some unagi and maguro... </p>

		<p>Ran across this little diddy today (July 18th) at Wired&#8217;s Monkeybites:<br />
<br />&quot;Bikely is a community site that hopes to crack that cycle of dull drudgery. Bikely encourages users share their favorite virtual bike paths. You can go to the site and create your own routes or view the routes that other users have submitted. You can also download any routes as a GPX file &#8212; I knew that handlebar-mounted GPS unit on my vintage Bianchi would come in handy some day!&quot;<br />

		<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever gotten stuck in traffic on a bike (I live in DC). I guess that&#8217;s mostly because I break the law at every opportunity if it means I can go faster. AND I don&#8217;t wear a helmet. Yeah, that&#8217;s how cool I am.</p>

		<p>you can&#8217;t bicycle across the 520 bridge, if I remember correctly &#8211; the grates are too large and you will go splat.</p>

		<p>I was wondering why there was a huge gap in the light barriers on 520, now I know. Must have been a spectacular accident.</p>

		<p>There was a sign announcing the boat traffic closure the day before. &nbsp;That one sign was the only announcement I know of. &nbsp;Of course if I recall correctly (I don&#8217;t normally go across the bridge so didn&#8217;t pay much attention), the sign was on 405 South.</p>

		<p>Hey, at least you were doing the right thing by carrying your bike on a car, the way god intended them to travel. You&#8217;d be less likely to attract the attention of the House Unamerican Activities Committee if you didn&#8217;t have the bike at all, but you seem to be making progress in the right direction.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
