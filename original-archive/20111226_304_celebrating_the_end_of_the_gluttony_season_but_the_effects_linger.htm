<p>The Washington State Ferry system has reduced the rated carrying capacity of its fleet because <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/news/ap/transportation/obesity-rise-prompts-wash-ferries-capacity-change/nF7FZ/"> people have gotten fatter</a>: The average weight of an adult passenger has been officially revised from 160 pounds to 185 pounds. (That's from 11 stone 6 to 13 stone 3 in the UK, or from 73kg to 84kg for the rest of the world.)</p>
<p> This has happened before: In 1999, the rated capacity of Washington State ferries dropped when <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/health/nutritionfit/stories/seats041599hp.htm"> the previous method for determining seating density was abandoned</a> due to passengers' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY84MRnxVzo#t=30s"> big butts</a>. (I recall that <i>The Seattle Times</i> printed a ruler next to the article so that for readers could <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/asses"> assess</a> their own situation.) </p>
<p> In other news: Many hospitals, such as our own University of Washington Medical Center, have installed ceiling lifts in all their rooms <a href="http://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/article_27cb026e-e0e8-11e0-bafc-001cc4c03286.html"> due to the high number of obese patients</a>. </p>
<p> (The gluttony seasons begins on Hallowe'en and ends on Christmas, as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/10/13/10224266.aspx"> officially</a> declared by me.) </p>

		<p>Gluttony Season isn&#39;t over quite yet: there&#39;s still the N-course Old Year&#39;s Meal, the night of dumplings and fireworks, and the New Year&#39;s Breakfast to conquer. If you&#39;re having any Good Intentions in this direction, wait for the new year to come.</p>

		<p>For those who didn&#39;t read the article, it looks like what happened is the Coast Guard changed the definition of a &quot;person&quot;. The ferry service, faced with getting recertified with the new definition, just changed the number of people they&#39;re willing to sell tickets to in order to avoid going over the weight they were previously certified for.</p>
<p>Of course, these are car ferries, so they rarely fill up on passengers before they fill up on cars. It&#39;s almost hard to imagine how people could have any measurable effect on the floatation of a vessel that&#39;s carrying so many cars. The end result is that it will likely not have any noticeable change to the ferry service.</p>

		<p>I dunno. I imagine an average 25lb increase per person could affect weight and balance depending on the ship and where on it people are allowed to congregate. But then again the average american vehicle weight (including stuff people carry around in their cars) may fluctuate up and down too &#8211; my suspicion with no proof is a general trend upwards over the past decade.</p>

		<p>I would suppose they could do it the old fashioned way. The ship is certified for x tons displacement (x is usually in hundreds), measured by displacement while loading, using the Plimsoll line on the side of the ship to measure.</p>

		<p>That&#39;s hilarious. &nbsp;Though it doesn&#39;t surprise me at all. &nbsp;I hate to say it, but as much as I love my country, the gluttony season doesn&#39;t end in America. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>The average weight of a person is serious business.</p>
<p>For an example where the estimated average weight (140 pounds) being less than the actual average weight (168 pounds) was a factor in a serious accident, see the NTSB report for the Lady D accident: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/summary/MAR0601.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ntsb.gov/&#8230;/MAR0601.htm</a></p>

		<p>Sorry for the double post, but I thought this footnote from that NTSB report is so relevant to this blog post that it should be quoted in full:</p>
<p>&quot;From interviews and hospital records, the Safety Board determined that the average weight of the</p>
<p>children was 55 pounds and the average weight of the adults was 184 pounds, which equated to an average</p>
<p>occupant weight of 168.4 pounds.&quot;</p>
<p>And now the new average is 185 pounds&#8230; It would not surprise me if that change came from the conclusions of this NTSB report.</p>

		<p>Season?! Get serious, there is no such thing as &quot;season&quot; regarding gluttony in America. It&#39;s the normal state at all times.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
