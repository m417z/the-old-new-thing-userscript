<p> Internal to Microsoft are thousands of Web sites. This is a story about one of them. </p>
<p> On an internal discussion list, somebody asked </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We just created a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense_word"> Flurb</a>. Does anyone know how to get listed on http://internalsite/newflurbs? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I hadn't heard of that site before, but I checked it out. Neat, it's basically a blog which announces new Flurbs. I can see how somebody would want their Flurb to be listed there. I also saw lots of pieces of information on the page which the person appears not to have noticed. I replied, </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Um, how about the <i>Email</i> link in the navigation bar? Or did you try that and it didn't work? </p>
<p> Also, each entry has the same name at the bottom. You could try contacting that person. </p>
<p> Just giving you some ideas on problem-solving techniques. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b>Pre-emptive snarky comment</b>: "Hey, Raymond, where's your contact link?" I was forced to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/22/232903.aspx"> disable the contact link</a> some time ago because it was being used primarily to send spam. Finding my email address is left as an exercise. (It's not hard.) </p>

		<p>Alex Marshall:</p>
<p>Raymond&#39;s email address can be found in the &quot;Raymond Chen&quot; link in his TechNet column. It goes in the form of <a href="mailto:somebody@someoperatingsystem.somecompany.com">somebody@someoperatingsystem.somecompany.com</a>. I hope he doesn&#39;t get too much spam. And why was my previous comment deleted?</p>

		<p>If I were to speculate, I&#39;d say that finding Raymond&#39;s email address is supposed to be something like an intelligence test to discourage casual use. I did find an email address that either is or was his; I just don&#39;t know for sure if it&#39;s current.</p>

<p>Not sure whether their question was an internal PR stunt for the new Flurb or for <a href="http://internalsite/newflurbs" rel="nofollow">http://internalsite/newflurbs</a> itself.</p>

		<p>&gt; Sometimes people can be so helpless</p>
<p>Or Clueless. I maintain a website, and received an email (not too long ago) sent through the contact form of the website (!) asking me if I had any RSS-feeds that they could use. So I replied: sure, have you seen the links on *every* page on the website (including the page that holds the contact form!) that say &quot;RSS&quot;?</p>
<p>The answer: Oh yes, I guess I should have looked at your website first.</p>

		<p>@stefan,</p>
<p>If the information is available on the web: sure. But I have several times been in arguments with vendors who won&#39;t disclose their documentation until we&#39;ve bought their products. I insist that reading the (complete) documentation is one of the essential ways to discover limitations and restrictions in the software, important to our decision to buy or forget. Referring me to &quot;the URL and login code you received when you bought the product&quot; is quite meaninless then.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a different situation from the one you describe. but it shows that the user (read: potential customer) doesn&#39;t always have all the information you take for granted, or operates in a context like the one you take for granted.</p>

		<p>@jb,</p>
<p>Very true. But they also for some reason do not look for or search for the information that they want if it isn&#39;t immediately shoved in front of them. They also do not seem to understand that there may be other users with different needs/requirements that you also have to serve, so as provider you have to find a middle ground where basically nobody is competely satisfied. As an example: I once gave a customized training on a piece of software to 6 employees of a customer. When I received the evaluation forms on that training, 4 of them said they were not entirely satisfied, two of them were. On closer inspection 2 of the 4 said that there was too much practical exercise and too little theory, the other two said they received too much theory and too little practical exercise. The last two thought the split was just right. So from my perspective as the trainer I did it exactly right, even though 4 of 6 said that I didn&#39;t. But apart from training them separate there was no way I could have done better.</p>
<p>That&#39;s from a provider/vendor&#39;s point of view. From a customer&#39;s point of view, you are absolutely right, and if a vendor would ever say that to me I would take my business elsewhere (and I would let them know too!).</p>
<p>I guess it all boils down to: You can never do it right :-) (but you can find a middle ground usually)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
