		<p>In most european cities, the &quot;traditional&quot; commuter would be the one coming via public transport. Which isn&#39;t even in your list :( Having lived in the US (specifically the Bay Area) for a few months, I was really shocked just how bad your public transport was.</p>

<p>Or rather that&#39;s how you&#39;d like it to be.</p>

		<p>@anyfoo: &nbsp;Which &quot;Bay Area&quot;? &nbsp;The San Francisco Bay area has pretty good public transportation, or so I thought when I lived there. &nbsp;I commuted from Concord to San Francisco every day by light rail (BART train) for a long time (30 miles).</p>

		<p>My experience of living in the Seattle area for five years is that whether you think their public transit system is fantastic or terrible depends on (a) whether you work in one of a handful of downtown cores, and (b) whether you work Monday-Friday during roughly daytime hours. I don&#39;t know if the same applies to the SF Bay Area.</p>

		<p>I was in San Francisco a while back, and my experience from talking to some locals is that the public transit system there is not as bad as in most other places in the states. I was staying in San Jose for a conference and used the train to go up to the city on my one free day, and that worked reasonably well.</p>
<p>Still, I live in Tokyo. By comparison, public transportation is bad anywhere else. You&#39;re pretty much never further than a stone&#39;s throw away from a train or subway station.</p>

		<p>Have to say, however, that I have no bad memories of the public transit systems within San Francisco (or also New York, when I visited). So at least in some cities, if you stay within its bounds, it might be okay. But that&#39;s especially hard in the Silicon Valley&#8230;</p>

		<p>@anyfoo: &quot;I was really shocked just how bad your public transport was.&quot;</p>
<p>Let me clue you in a big difference between the US and most European countries: Geographical size.</p>
<p>There is no way the US could ever approach the public transit availability (relative to population size) as other countries, because we are too spread out. The major cities do a fair job with subway, rail, and bus. Outside that, it becomes too impractical.</p>

		<p>Lest anyone get the wrong idea, Microsoft, particularly in Seattle has been a forceful proponent of public transit. &nbsp;In addition to King County Metro, Microsoft runs a fleet of buses that bring in workers from many surrounding areas. &nbsp;I was very impressed that their was very comfortable coaches that ran relatively close to where I lived, which was considered an unincorporated rural area.</p>
<p>FYI, I found the San Jose public transit system to be very comprehensive. &nbsp;Doesn&#39;t compare to the London and Reading region of England, but very good.</p>
<p>I think another major reason in the differences in public transit in United States vs. Europe is simply cultural. &nbsp;While geographic distances area a consideration, traditional tax and economic policies make land and automobile ownership easier and cheaper in the United States than Europe. &nbsp;That&#39;s my opinion of course.</p>

		<p>Isn&#39;t the lack of &#39;good&#39; public transport in much of the US due to the cultural impacts of capitalism, postwar wealth, and US-style government? <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Streetcar_Conspiracy" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/General_Motors_Streetcar_Conspiracy</a></p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
