		<p>@Parkrrrr and violet &#8211; I think your are missing soemthing here. Why do they use the &quot;MySpace Angle&quot;? As a veteran of internet dating, I met my wife on a dating website in 1996, it is pointless to misrepresent yourself. Everyone has a &quot;type&quot;. If someone merkets themselves as a &quot;type&quot; and then shows up as something else, the result is usually that you feel decieved, at best. The right thing to do is be yourself and be happy with who you are. If you are not happy with who you are, change! Clearly the examples in the article are not happy with themselves, that is why they post the intentionally misleading photos. That is not my fault or my problem. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Outside of someone with an eating disorder, the most photo-averse people I can think of are nerds, so it has always surprised me that modern software, as the article mentions, practically demands photos of its user.</p>
<p>The fact that Facebook seems so insistent on having one or more user photos is one of the chief things that keeps me away from it (Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s involvement with the CIA being the other).</p>

		<p>Well well, some people seem to be a little defensive here.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a difference between &quot;shaming&quot; people who are (very) overweight, and shaming people who posted distorted and misleading photos of themselves while claiming to have an &quot;average&quot; body type. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a form of lying, and I can&#8217;t say I have anything against exposing lies.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see it as being vindictive. &nbsp;I see it as leaving a polite warning to other would-be suitors explaining that this person is not who s/he says s/he is.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, I also know many people who look fine in life but have rather unflattering online photos.</p>

		<p>I agree with Fil. A colleague looks rather dorky in her FaceBook photos. Yet in real life, she&#8217;s one of the cutest girls I&#8217;ve ever met.</p>
<p>Plus my 1 year old granddaughter is way cuter in real life than in the photos I use to fill my FaceBook albums, though though are so cute, I may get a take down order since I&#8217;m causing parents world wide to become depressed at just how ugly their own children/grandchildren are by comparison.</p>

		<p>Seriously. If you&#8217;re not attracted to someone, fine. If you *thought* you were into them based on a few conversations and pictures from the tubes&#8230; that&#8217;s more than a little sketchy, but fine. Let it go. Move on. Find someone you *do* like, who likes you back.</p>
<p>Or, I suppose, you could shame the woman who &quot;DECIEVED!!!11oneone&quot; you by posting unflattering shots of her on your site, shaming her for being FATFATFATFATTYFATFAT and just generally living up to whatever standards of beauty you conjured up today. And then saying that you banged her anyway, but only after you were *really* drunk.</p>

		<p>Now I want to see a myspace angle of raymond; that or him taking a cellphone shot in a MS bathroom mirror &#8211; comedy gold!</p>
<p>As for me, FB wants a photo, but they don&#8217;t care about it being me or even a real person. For instance, most of my profile photos aren&#8217;t even human &#8211; my favorite among them is a rodent holding a corn kernel.</p>

		<p>@Steve And I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve always posted the least flattering possible pictures of yourself, right? I mean, if you didn&#8217;t, you&#8217;re obviously not happy with yourself.</p>
<p>Which is a bloody brilliant justification for profoundly hateful garbage. Any of the &quot;wronged,&quot; &quot;deceived*&quot; men could have just said, &quot;Oh, sorry, your photo looked different,&quot; and walked away from the date; that would mark them as shallow, but at least relatively forthright. Instead, they went to the internet. Where they posted the least flattering photos possible of these women, and peppered the gallery with sexualized appearance shaming. Why? What do they gain from that&#8211;what does anyone gain from that&#8211;except validation of their unfettered rights to women&#8217;s bodies, including their right to judge and ridicule them? Outside of that, what&#8217;s the fracking point?</p>
<p>* &#8211; As an aside, think about how they got these pictures. Most of them look to be from webcams or cell phones. Implying, of course, that they *hadn&#8217;t* met in person, and the intense agony I&#8217;m sure these men felt lasted for the MANY AGES it took them to delete a bloody e-mail.</p>

All of those crafty women had me fooled until the inevitable and terrifying &quot;exposure&quot;. *Ugh* Thanks Raymond you&#8217;ve made my day and luckily saved me from several unnecessary marriage proposals for hags on MySpace and the rest of the intertubes.

		<p>I&#8217;m sure the phenomenon is real, but I have to think that at least some of the more exaggerated examples in the first article (eg. the first one starring hyperobese girl) seem clearly staged. &nbsp;(That is, rather than an actual example from Facebook, they found/paid that someone and took two pictures of them just to make the point in the article.)</p>
<p>And some of the examples are downright bizarre. &nbsp;Like, the &quot;myspace angle&quot; photo in the second example is really that much better than the &quot;real&quot; shot? &nbsp;Seriously? &nbsp;That the slightest hint of fat is so repulsively that people would prefer a crude, badly lit cellphone photo that you can barely tell whether it&#8217;s male or female (or whether she has hair)?</p>
<p>And frankly, on some level I just ain&#8217;t all that surprised or shocked, given that even your everyday fashion magazines feel the need to airbrush pictures of stars and supermodels way hotter than anyone you&#8217;ve dated.</p>

		<p>Well, not into the whole facebook thing, but created an account years ago to meet an old friend. My profile photo&#8217;s just a cropped picture that was taken on my first solo (pilot) of me doing a silly thumbs-up thing in front of the plane.</p>
<p>Something decent, acceptable, and above all, professional.</p>
<p>Came in handy for a silly contest Microsoft&#8217;s holding on facebook.</p>

		<p>The Myspace Angles phenomenon is nothing new; it&#8217;s just an emergent form of false advertising, which is why people find it annoying and make fun of it.</p>
<p>On a site where people may track me down for job-related reasons, I&#8217;d post something normal and professional. &nbsp;Me standing there smiling perhaps?!?!</p>
<p>However, if I post a picture of myself on a dating site where I&#8217;m there with no shirt and a six pack, you&#8217;d figure the lady would have to be disappointed when we meet and she realizes the picture is 4 years old and I&#8217;m horribly out of shape now.</p>

		<p>Yes. &nbsp;Yes, I&#8217;m a dog. &nbsp;I freely admit it. &nbsp;I just don&#8217;t have any pictures to prove it. &nbsp;Having no thumbs, it&#8217;s hard to take them. &nbsp;Typing is much more easily managed, but people don&#8217;t care about a description. &nbsp;I could wax poetic about my shaggy gray coat, but no one cares. &nbsp;I&#8217;m taken, anyway.</p>

		<p>That reminds of a few years ago when we advertised for a technical (intro programming) position. I was surprised at the number of resumes we got with pictures attached. They were all attractive women, but the motivation to attach a picture to a resume for a job not at Hooters is certainly questionable.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
