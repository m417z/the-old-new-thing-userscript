<p>Many years ago, the local public radio station invited the three candidates for Seattle Port Commissioner to take part in a program on the upcoming election. Each candidate was given some time to address the voters directly. Here's how it went, roughly.</p>
<p> Candidate&nbsp;1: "We need an experienced person to find solutions for our region's transportation problems while still protecting the Sound against environmental damage." </p>
<p> Candidate&nbsp;2: "We need to make the port more attractive to cruise ships by lowering fees. I assure you that the fact that I own a cruise ship company is purely coincidental." </p>
<p> Candidate&nbsp;3: "We need to shorten the work week to avoid layoffs. We must forgive all third-world debt. And the United States must pull its troops out of East Timor." </p>
<p> Once again, this was an election for the position of Seattle Port Commissioner. (It reminds me of my graduate school days where the undergraduate student government passed a resolution condemning the government of El Salvador. Yeah, that'll show them. I can imagine a meeting down there in San Salvador: "Ooh, we'd better get our act together. Those college students in the United States are really upset with us.") </p>

		<p>While these types are normally quite silly, there are times when they can be effective. South African apartheid comes to mind.</p>
<p>On a related note, although it is something we as a nation have totally disregarded, the soft power of dimplomacy is often much stronger than the hard power of military threats &#8212; and although I am sure I have been pegged as a wooly headed pacifist, it is true.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s really that usual for someone to run for elected office just to get a platform for make a political statement about some unrelated topic. &nbsp;Take for example Stan Lippman, who is running for Seattle City Council this year. &nbsp;I think you wrote about him in a recent blog posting. &nbsp;He runs for office all the time because he feels &quot;compelled to spread the word</p>
<p>about dangerous vaccine mandates by running for office.&quot; &nbsp;He was once almost fatally injured by a vaccine. &nbsp;He gets his message in the voters guide that is mailed to every household in the city. &nbsp;Cheaper than printing out your own mailing, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>

<p>I just think that in most people&#8217;s mind (be it voters or dictators so that is not specific to democracy), the economy argument almost always wins against the ecology argument.</p>

		<p>Yep. Very strange &#8211; but he could say he kept his promiss on that one though. ;-)</p>
<p>Regarding East Timor, Portugal is there at their request (East Timor is a Portuguese ex-colony, and the Portuguese people never gave up &#8216;fighting&#8217; for their independence from Indonesia) and it&#8217;s not troops we have there, but the GNR (militarized police).</p>
<p>The Australians troops weren&#8217;t very keen on keeping the order when things started going down hill, so Xanana Gusm&#227;o (the East Timor President) specifically asked for an independent Portuguese police force.</p>
<p>Unlike others, we don&#8217;t pour into foreign countries unless invited. Guess that&#8217;s why we are welcome everywhere, hehe. ;-)</p>

		<p>What I don&#8217;t understand is why the position of Port Commissioner is voted on by the public. &nbsp;Surely, the vast majority of voters couldn&#8217;t care less who does that job. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not like you could ever have a despotic and megalomaniacal Port Commissioner. &nbsp;Is this sort of thing normal in the U.S.?</p>

		<p>&quot;why the position of Port Commissioner is voted on by the public&quot;</p>
<p>Well, power. To set rates (as with the tour boat guy), to favor contractors who know where to contribute, to set policies favoring labor or not, to spend money on more dredging or to economize with less. Also patronage, an important aspect of power.</p>
<p>If you want an exhaustive example of what power can attach to dull-sounding positions, you can try reading <em>The Power Broker</em>, a life of Robert Moses written by Robert Caro.</p>

		<p>This is related to what the &quot;Right To Life&quot; party does, at least here in New York. &nbsp;It&#8217;s their goal to get someone on the ballot for every race, no matter how insignificant, and for that someone to push the RTL agenda. &nbsp;So you get things like this:</p>
<p>Name: Joe Slobotnik</p>
<p>Running for: Tax collector</p>
<p>Current job: Gas station attendant</p>
<p>Q: &quot;If elected, what will you do about taxes?&quot;</p>
<p>A: Saving the lives of unborn babies is the most important thing in the world. &nbsp;I will make sure no abortion is ever performed again on the face of the Earth.</p>

		<p>&quot;What happens in the U.S.&quot; is largely a local issue. &nbsp;Many states and municipalities have wide differences between which positions are elected and which are appointed. &nbsp;There have also been varying changes at these levels over the years, and varying points of view on whether it&#8217;s better to elect or appoint. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, in some states, counties, towns, school boards, etc. etc., positions are not allowed to partisan. &nbsp;In other words, you don&#8217;t state what party you might be registered or not registered with and it officially doesn&#8217;t factor into the election.</p>
<p>So, for some reason that probably has interesting historical background, this position in this municipality is elected.</p>

<p>Wait, so is he promising to relocate the procedures to:</p>
<p>1) Orbital facilities</p>
<p>2) Airborne facilities</p>
<p>3) Subterranean facilities</p>
<p>4) Submarine facilities</p>
<p>Not &quot;on the face of the Earth&quot; is just to vague. &nbsp;I would totally support a tax man pushing for subterranean facilities, that just cost effective. &nbsp;And orbital facilities have a certain style, so might go for that but submarine facilities are just dumb.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d worry that the RTL tax collector might use his powers to audit everyone who has an abortion or something. I&#8217;m pro-life myself, but I would seriously object to the powers of Taxes being used to intefere in the domain of Death. The two spheres of Inevitability need to stay firmly seperated.</p>

  I can imagine a meeting down there in San</p>

<p>Yup, some of those things are laughable. &nbsp;Another one occured when France refused to help reduce the level of freedom in Iraq. &nbsp;When the U.S. changed its name for fried potatoes from French Fries to Freedom Fries, someone suggested that Japan should change its word for corned frankfurters from American Dog to &#8230; &nbsp;[Oh no, I forgot what the suggested replacement was.] &nbsp;Anyway, that sure should have persuaded the U.S. not to invade Iraq. &nbsp;Can&#8217;t imagine why it didn&#8217;t work.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
