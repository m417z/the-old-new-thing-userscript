Boris asks,
"<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160104-00/?p=92771#comment-1220851">were there specific criteria for making a game work

</p>
<p>
I don't recall there being any formal criteria.
There was nearly always a good collection of game compatibility bugs
assigned to me,
which I guess wasn't surprising since that was one of my jobs
after all.
Sometimes it was easy to figure out;
sometimes it was hard.
Sometimes it took a day;
sometimes it took several days.
</p>
<p>
The bugs were assigned priorities and severities
by the person who found the bug.
For example, something that prevents the game from
running is more severe than a visual glitch
in a game that otherwise seems to run fine.
</p>
<p>
If the game was a major title, it was more important to fix,
compared to a game that didn't sell as many copies.
For example, DOOM was a pretty high priority to get working.
</p>
<p>
But overall, I was allowed to exercise my own judgment
as to how much time to spend trying to fix each game.
The fact that we had MS-DOS Mode available meant that
there was a fallback if I couldn't figure out what was
wrong, or if I figured out what was wrong and there
was no practical way around it.
</p>
<p>
I"ll take the next few Mondays discussing some of the
things that I had to deal with.
It's cheaper than therapy.</p>

		<p>I wonder if you&#8217;re also experienced in DirectX game development, Raymond. You speak about &#8220;visual glitches&#8221;, which might just happen from changes the Direct3D team made (or a funny graphics chipset telling Direct3D it supports everything, to cite one of your famous articles). Wouldn&#8217;t you forward the issue to them then? Or were these &#8220;fix this game&#8221; tickets from a time before DirectX?</p>

		<p>DirectX didn&#8217;t release until a month after Windows 95 was released, and most games at the time were designed to run in DOS anyway (or, on the rare occasion, use the WinG library).  It wasn&#8217;t built into Windows until the OSR2 release, which was the following year.</p>

		<p>Me too! Especially since I still play some of those games, thanks to DOSBox. In fact, I suspect one of the games I play may be Example 85 in the second bonus chapter. (This example is a space-themed game that needs 30 XMS handles during planet landing but doesn&#8217;t check whether they could all be allocated, with interesting consequences. The game I have in mind is a space-themed game that, under DOSBox, has a long pause at the planet landing stage, much longer than it had when playing in real DOS.) Is 1992 long enough ago to break the no-naming rule?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
