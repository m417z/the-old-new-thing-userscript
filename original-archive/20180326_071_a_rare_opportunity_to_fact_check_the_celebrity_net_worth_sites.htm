The late John Mahoney
left
<a HREF="http://www.tmz.com/2018/03/24/frasier-star-john-mahoney-leaves-behind-millions/">
an estate worth "north of $5 million"</a>
according to documents obtained by celebrity news site TMZ.
</p>
<p>
This gave me a rare opportunity to fact-check various
"celebrity net worth" sites.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    celebritynetworth.com says
    <a HREF="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/john-mahoney-net-worth/">
    $16 million</a>.
    <a HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20180206071607/https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/john-mahoney-net-worth/">Archived page</a>.
    "All net worths are calculated by applying a proprietary algorithm.
    The results are then fact checked and confirmed by a team of editors.
    We scan all publicly available data and resources and work diligently
    to ensure that our numbers are the most accurate and
    up to date net worth data you will find anywhere on the internet."
</li>
<li>
    networthpost.com says
    <a HREF="https://networthpost.com/john-mahoney-net-worth/">
    $15 million</a>.
    <a HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20180206041648/https://networthpost.com/john-mahoney-net-worth/">
    Archived page</a>.
    "According to authoritative sources,
    it has been estimated that John Mahoney's
    net worth is as high as $15 million."
    I like this hedge.
    It's not saying that authoritative sources estimate
    Mahoney's net worth at $15 million.
    It's saying that authoritative sources have
    <i>reported that</i>
    Mahoney's net worth has been estimated at $15 million.
</li>
<li>
    celebritynetworth123.com says
    <a HREF="https://www.celebritynetworth123.com/richest-celebrities/john-mahoney-net-worth/">
    $15 million</a>.
    "The John Mahoney net worth and salary figures above
    have been reported from a number of credible sources and websites."
    I suspect those credible sources and Web sites are
    "all the other celebrity net worth sites."
</li>
<li>
    therichest.com says
    <a HREF="https://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celeb/actors/john-mahoney-net-worth/">
    $15 million</a>
    (<a HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20180206042216/https://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celeb/actors/john-mahoney-net-worth/">archived page</a>)
    and cites no sources.
</li>
<li>
    getnetworth.com says
    <a HREF="http://www.getnetworth.com/john-mahoney-net-worth/">
    $15 million</a>
    (<a HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20160528041246/http://www.getnetworth.com/john-mahoney-net-worth/">archived page</a>)
    and cites no sources.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My guess is that everybody copied their data from
celebritynetworth.com,
because their estimates all agree with the estimate of
celebritynetworth.com as of 2017.
celebritynetworth.com revised their estimate early in 2018,
but the other sites haven't caught up.
</p>
<p>
Now, technically, all of these estimates are "north of $5 million",
but one would think that if the documents said $15 million,
TMZ would have reported something closer to that value.
"North of $5 million" suggests that the actual value is between $5 million
and $6 million.</p>

		<p>Getting data yourself and do analysis is difficult.</p>
<p>On the other hand, scrap data from other site and find the mode is easy, so usually the minimum energy path is chosen.</p>

		<p>My guess is that the $5 million comes from an early estimate used on the paperwork to start probate.  It was probably easy to show that the estate had at least $5 million, which is perhaps a threshold for the type of probate being requested.  Higher estimates likely came later after there was more time to determine the extent of the estate.</p>

		<p>I love the &#8220;proprietary algorithm&#8221; schtick.  Almost as hilarious as the routine &#8220;you asked for it under the Freedom of Information Act, but we can&#8217;t tell you, because it would breach Commercial Confidentiality.&#8221;</p>
<p>In memory of the great John Mahoney, a Chicago stalwart, I would suggest that he would deny any figure &#8220;north of&#8221; but quite possibly accept one that was &#8220;north by northwest of.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Small geographical joke, incorporating the fact that both John and Cary Grant were born in England.)</p>

		<p>My guess is that these sites&#8217; analysis is based almost entirely on estimating total assets, and without accounting for the other half of &#8220;net worth,&#8221; i.e., total liabilities.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
