A customer was having trouble obtaining information from
a shortcut file.
"Here is a sample program that tries to print the target
of a shortcut file, but it only gets the file name without
a directory.
How do I get the full path?"
</p>
<pre>
 IShellLink *psl;
 ... code that loads the IShellLink omitted ...
 TCHAR szPath[MAX_PATH];
 WIN32_FIND_DATA wfd;
 hr = psl-&gt;GetPath(szPath, MAX_PATH, &amp;wfd, SLGP_UNCPATH);
 if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
  _tprintf(TEXT("Got path: %s\n"), wfd.cFileName);
 }
</pre>
<p>
Recall that the <code>WIN32_<wbr>FIND_<wbr>DATA</code> structure
contains only a file name in the <code>cFile&shy;Name</code> member.
It doesn't have any path information.
The <code>WIN32_<wbr>FIND_<wbr>DATA</code> structure was
originally created for the <code>Find&shy;First&shy;File</code>
function,
and you already know the directory you are searching in
because you passed it to
<code>Find&shy;First&shy;File</code>.
</p>
<p>
But we're not using the
<code>WIN32_<wbr>FIND_<wbr>DATA</code> structure in
conjunction with
<code>Find&shy;First&shy;File</code>,
so where do I get the directory from?
</p>
<p>
In the customer's excitement over the
<code>WIN32_<wbr>FIND_<wbr>DATA</code> structure,
they forgot about that other parameter:
<code>szPath</code>.</p>
<pre>
 if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
  _tprintf(TEXT("Got path: %s\n"), szPath);
 }
</pre>
<p>The answer was sitting right there in front of them,
like an overlooked Christmas present.
</p>
<p>
(Don't forget, the target of the shortcut might not be a file,
in which case
the call to <code>Get&shy;Path</code> will return <code>S_FALSE</code>.)</p>

		<p>Raymond, looks like your tagline about .NET has gone missing. &nbsp;And the inevitable questions about using the WinAPI from .NET have already started.</p>
<p>cron22, developers of the framework do enjoy the benefits of the WinAPI. &nbsp;Almost every file-related function in the framework calls a Win32 API function to do the real work. &nbsp;I guess you meant users of the framework, but they can use COM objects too, due to the magic of interop.</p>

		<p>Yes, Interop is good, except in places where it is unsupported for some reason such as in MAPI. &nbsp;I meant to ask, why on earth is that? &nbsp;Why aren&#39;t things like MAPI supported by Interop? &nbsp;</p>

		<p>@Joshua, Explorer shows the target of an advertised shortcut as greyed out, doesn&#39;t mean the target&#39;s the installation directory. The target is stored in a key file, it&#39;s just that Windows annoyingly doesn&#39;t give the USER the control it should give over changing (or even showing) the target path or even changing the icon. There should be a Group Policy to never create advertised shortcuts. You can&#39;t even check &quot;Run as administrator&quot; for the evil advertised shortcut. Its self healing feature is also annoying as hell.</p>

		<p>Sorry xpclient I appear to have grossly misunderstood your question.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure if you want rid of them you can blast them out of existence with a shell plugin, but there&#39;s got to be an easier way.</p>

		<p>@xpclient: Most users don&#39;t understand that GPOs are for their own good. A corporate environment must be easy to administer from a central command. And computers are typically not owned by employees, not their property to fiddle with. Try to spend your time on doing the work you have been assigned to do instead.</p>

		<p>@xpclient. See MsiGetShortcutTarget() function. With the returned ProductCode and ComponentCode you can get the target file path with the MsiGetComponentPath() function. No, you can&#39;t edit them. That would defeat their purpose (resilience, install on demand).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
