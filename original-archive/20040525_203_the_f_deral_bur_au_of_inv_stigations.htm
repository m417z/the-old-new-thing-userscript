		<p>I suspect they mean it in the sense of representing yourself as having their authority &#8211; impersonating an officer or whatnot.</p>
<p>It certainly is worded vaugely, though.</p>

		<p>Or maybe they mean using them in a commercial context, i.e., selling jackets that say &quot;___&quot; (the three initials in question) on the back.</p>

<p>Title 18 Chapter 33 Section 709 (18 USC 709): </p>
<p>&quot;Whoever, except with the written permission of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, knowingly uses the words &#8221;Federal Bureau of Investigation&#8221; or the initials &#8221;F.B.I.&#8221;, or any colorable imitation of such words or initials, in connection with any advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet or other publication, play, motion picture, broadcast, telecast, or other production, in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet or other publication, play, motion picture, broadcast, telecast, or other production, is approved, endorsed, or authorized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation;&quot; </p>
<p>So, saying &quot;Up the FBI&quot; is fine, whether accompanied by a raised finger or cheering, since neither is likely to convey the approval, endorsement or authorization of the FBI. Particularly the former.</p>

		<p>Isn&#8217;t this along the lines of Intel trademarking the letter I?  Sure, it sounds silly when you read the sweeping statement, but enforcement of such things always depends on context.</p>
<p>I like to think that there is SOME common sense left in the world, evidence to the contrary notwithstanding.<br /></p>

<p>The NFL/NBA/NHL/MLB just tell you you can&#8217;t rebroadcast it. Recording it and watching it at your convenience doesn&#8217;t constitute a re*broadcast*.</p>
<p>Basically covering their asses from letting any channel show their games and/or highlights.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
