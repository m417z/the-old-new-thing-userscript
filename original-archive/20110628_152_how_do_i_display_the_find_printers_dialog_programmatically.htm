<p>A customer wanted to display the Find Printers dialog programmatically to let the user pick a printer from Active Directory and wanted to know whether this was possible.</p>
<p> Yes, it's possible, and there's more than one way to do it. There's the lazy way and the overachieving way. </p>
<p> The overachieving way is to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms676933.aspx"> the <code>ICommon&shy;Query::<wbr>Open&shy;Query&shy;Window</wbr></code> method</a>. The <code>Find&shy;AD&shy;Printers</code> sample function spells it all out for you. </p>
<p> The lazy way takes a little bit of out-of-the-box thinking: Open the Find Printers dialog, set up the search the way you want it, and then save the search to a file (<i>File, Save Search</i>). In your program, when you need to open the Find Printers dialog, just <code>Shell&shy;Execute</code> the saved search. </p>

		<p>I found the simplest way is to just call IShellDispatch2::FindPrinter &#8211; <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb774134(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/bb774134(v=vs.85).aspx</a></p>
<p>BTW, I&#39;ve never used OpenQueryWindow, but it seems an added benefit of using it is that the code gets back the selected printer. With ShellExecute or FindPrinter you don&#39;t get that.</p>

		<p>Hrm, that saved search thing sounds cool, but why do I get the impression I&#39;m going to see it on thedailywtf in the near future?</p>

		<p>This doesn&#39;t feel lazy at all. This feels smart. This feels the way software should be designed to avoid being bloated.</p>

		<p>@Raymond, about the lazy way, what if some one used this way from Xp (or 95 era) and tries to run it now? Since .fnd is no longer supported will it still work?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
