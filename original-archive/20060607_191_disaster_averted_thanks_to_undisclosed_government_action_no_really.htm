<p>On his web site, <a href="http://www.savelivesinmay.com"> http://www.savelivesinmay.com</a>, Eric Julien predicted that (and I hope I got this right) on May&nbsp;25, 2006, comet fragments generated in 1995 by a hostile extraterrestrial civilization would impact the Atlantic Ocean near the Azores, followed by volcanic eruptions which would create a giant tsunami that would wipe out the East coast of the United States.</p>
<p> As the fateful day approached, the predicted date turned into <a href="http://www.savelivesinmay.com/slimdocs/News-May-25-en.htm"> a 48-hour window</a>, and then <a href="http://www.savelivesinmay.com/slimdocs/Press-Release-3-en.htm"> triumphant relief that the United States government heeded his warning and prevented the tsunami from striking</a>. </p>
<p> But we're not out of the woods yet. "A catastrophe of an unprecedented size... may occur in the coming days if the media of the entire world does not inform the public immediately of the reality of the presence of extraterrestrials on Earth." </p>
<p> They'll get right on that. </p>
<p> (By the way, the <a href="http://www.voyagehollowearth.com/"> Voyage to Our Hollow Earth</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/11/56058.aspx"> originally scheduled for June 26, 2005</a>, then <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/18/409206.aspx"> rescheduled for June 26, 2006</a> has now been rescheduled for June 26, 2007.) </p>

		<p>Not &quot;somehow.&quot; They scheduled the end of the world on that day BECAUSE it&#8217;s your birthday. You really should not have dipped that alien girl&#8217;s pigtail in the inkwell.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, at least some recent U.S. presidents also believed that the final end is due in their lifetime. Maybe somebody can offer some exact quotes?</p>

		<p>Eric&#8217;s my favourite kind of kook, well meaning, sincere, and nutty as a fruit cake.</p>
<p>For fun, look at the forum to see his followers wriggling around trying to say that the prediction of doom wasn&#8217;t a prediction at all.</p>
<p>As Peter Venkman suggested to doom-mongers in Ghostbusters II, perhaps Eric should have put his prophecy of disaster farther away in time, just so he&#8217;d have a change to collect some royalties on his book.</p>

<br />===</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what is so interesting about that. &nbsp;The belief system behind many Christian&#8217;s view that the 2nd Coming is a generation or two away is called:</p>
<p>Pre-Tribulation Rapture Dispensational Premillennialism</p>
<p>(I love saying that)</p>
<p>That escathology is one that takes a consolidated literal view of the entire Bible prophetical statements about the Jewish and Christian end times. &nbsp;</p>
<p>By more or less guessing what preconditions need to be in place , those preconditions are benchmarks for closeness to thier view of the end time scnerio.</p>
<p>THis specific system of beliefs is very Jewish-focused (thus the term Dispensional).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not one of those &quot;The world is ending on June 23, 2008&quot; types of deals though of course some eager people do err and set dates they think can be milestones. So far of course none of have turned out to matter.</p>

		<p>Andrew C, but that particular prophet on Ghostbusters II was correct about his date, though Vigo&#8217;s plans were thwarted by our 4 (and then 3) heroes.</p>

		<p>The changing of the prophecy once it failed to come about and the increased proselyting is a well known psychological phenomena.</p>
<p>See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.whenprophecyfails.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.whenprophecyfails.org</a> for more examples and details of the definitive book on the topic.</p>
<p>It sounds like this group followed the script outlined in the book quite closely.</p>

		<p>My favourite insane conspiracy forum informs me that Microsoft and Google are in on the Hollow Earth cover-up:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://tinyurl.com/psovz" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/psovz</a></p>
<p>So Raymond, why can&#8217;t we fly to the poles? If you try and fob us off by saying that you&#8217;re not on the Flight Simulator team I&#8217;ll take that as further proof that there&#8217;s something to hide&#8230;</p>
<p>I guess we&#8217;ll have to ask Larry Page about the Antarctic bases. However, Wikipedia backs up the claim and ties it into the Hollow Earth:</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
