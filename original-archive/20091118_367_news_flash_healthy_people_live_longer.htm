		<p>A few months ago Comsumer Reports reported on a study that discovered that children who are more active during the day are more tired at night.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m waiting for the next groundbreaking study to show me that drinking more water yields more trips to the bathroom.</p>

<p>Looking at your book (or at least the photo of it) to the left, it looks like the cover of a cook book.</p>

		<p>I love it when journalists try to report on scientific research and end up simplifying it into something that&#8217;s blindingly obvious. If you read the article, you&#8217;ll see that the researchers actually quantified the correlation between fitness and mortality for men in a certain age group, and showed that the statistics were unaffected by whether the subject was white or black, or whether they had heart disease. Presumably that headline wouldn&#8217;t be as catchy as &quot;exercise is good for you&quot;, though.</p>
<p>If newspapers had been around when Newton discovered his law of gravitation, the headline would have been &quot;things fall when you drop them&quot;.</p>

		<p>Phrases like &quot;risk of death is 70% lower&quot; without further qualification are also amusing.</p>
<p>Sorry fit people. &nbsp;Your risk of death is still 100%.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m amused by the tone of the article &#8211; &quot;Healthy people live longer &#8211; even if they&#8217;re black!&quot; As if that&#8217;s the really surprising part.</p>

<p>Ah, but if &quot;Ye Fox Newes&quot; had been around they would have made sure it was &quot;Fayre and Balanced&quot; by spending two thirds of the time interviewing the Montgolfier Brothers.</p>

		<p>One of my favourite theories is that you get back at the end of your life all the time you spent exercising during it.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
