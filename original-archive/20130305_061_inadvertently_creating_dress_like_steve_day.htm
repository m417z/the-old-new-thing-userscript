<p>Even if you haven't been paying much attention, you may have noticed that Steve Sinofsky has developed a bit of a uniform for himself. You can pretty much count on him wearing a T-shirt with a V-neck sweater. (There appears to be some sort of alphabetic theme there, but I'm not going to check if he's also wearing a G-string.)</p>
<p> Some time ago, I realized as I was heading in to work that for the second day in a row, I happened to be wearing the Steve Sinofsky uniform. Was I subconsciously mirroring the boss? </p>
<p> As fate would have it, later that morning, I happened to run into Steve as we both headed from one building to the next. I remarked on my accidental fashion choice and emphasized that I wasn't trying to stalk him or anything. Steve quipped, "Funny you should say that. Just this morning, I was thinking of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/11/54888.aspx"> wearing a suit</a>." </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: As we reached our destination, I opened the door to let Steve into the building. Steve declined. "I have to let myself into the building. The security folks track my access key, and if they see anything unusual, like if I beep into a building without having beeped out of the previous building, they call my cell phone to confirm my whereabouts and to verify that my access key hasn't been stolen." </p>

		<p>G-strings and beeping. So many euphemisms.</p>

		<p>I have seen some of the brutal companies using the beeping thing to track their employees. Some of the tele-marketing companies even have their restrooms locked with electronics. But this is first time I have heard reason of security.</p>

		<p>The last point about logging in and out reminds me how frustrated I used to get with the reused-more-than-once Star Trek:TNG episodes when someone mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p>There was always a conversation with the computer that went &quot;Where is X?&quot; &quot;X is not on the Enterprise.&quot; Nobody ever thought to scream at the computer &quot;So, how did he leave, and if it wasn&#39;t by some approved method, like transporting down to a planet or on a shuttlecraft, WHY DIDN&#39;T YOU THINK IT WAS WORTH MENTIONING TO US?&quot;</p>
<p>Nice to see that in real life, the system isn&#39;t quite that stupid.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m more of a C-string man myself, though it makes searching for documentation on the CString class (or just plain old C strings) a bit awkward.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m sure a Windows guy would be wearing an LPCSTR, or an LPWSTR to be trendy. (LPTSTR would probably be more the metrosexual look.)</p>

		<p>Makes sense for both company security and security of employees&#8230; I suppose.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the story, I think it is more likely Steve was stalking Raymond ;-)</p>

		<p>I know you pre-record a lot of this stuff, but didn&#39;t Sinofsky depart Microsoft permanently last year some time? So you can relax in that department, anyway.</p>

		<p>@stoneyowl: And there is also a guard at the entrance, who checks that the person entered is the one who owns the beeped card. He also sort things out with guest passes and cases when an emploeyer forgot his card.</p>
<p>Well, my company uses those card primarily to track the time one spends at the work. If you shows up late, or leaves early, or misses a day, it&#39;s all in the logs.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
