		<p>Perhaps this is some kind or Turing or Voight-Kampff test? Raymond may be testing us through our replies to a completely different dream, as Deckard tests Rachel with the famous question about the upside-down turtle&#8230; Or I may be reading too much between the lines :-P .</p>

		<p>@Antonio &#39;Grijan&#39;</p>
<p>It is indeed curious why Raymond would write a post absolutely devoid of content. My guess is that he&#39;s cleared his five-year blog post queue, and that blogging has somehow become a goal on his annual performance review. At least, this seems to be the least implausible explanation.</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command you&#39;re apparently missing the fact that Raymond decides to write what he likes, he&#39;s not under any obligation to provide some pre-agreed content. So, I take them simply as his choice of how to occupy his time, assuming that he likes to share such creations of his mind. Simple, no? For the time being, it&#39;s dreams on monday. We&#39;ll see, if we&#39;ll care, what the future will bring. By the way, Raymond, thanks for taking your time to write on this platform.</p>

		<p>@Mike</p>
<p>My wife tried that &#8211; our 3-year-old was sick the other night and woke up a few times. We usually take turns for things like that, and I ended up having to calm him down and get him back to bed when he woke up at about 2:30 in the morning. The next time he woke up she tried to tell me that she dealt with him last time and it was my turn. Then she remembered that she calmed him down by watching cows graze in our front lawn, and admitted that it must have just been a dream.</p>

		<p>The feeling of &quot;I dreamed that I was &lt;doing something&gt; with my lovely &lt;nuclear family member&gt;&quot; is timeless and very inspiring. It reminds us the kind of inexplicable attachment we have with the ones we love the most.</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command, I guess you like it when someone you know from nowhere comes to your personal space/blog and says &quot;I really don&#39;t understand why you say/post these things. What&#39;s the point? Jeez!&quot;</p>
<p>Well, how about just silently stop following the blog, then? Are we children yet?</p>
<p>Do you see something awefully wrong here? I don&#39;t. This isn&#39;t the &quot;Official Win32 Strictly Technical Blog (Mainly About Old Stuff)&quot;, it&#39;s Raymond&#39;s blog.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&#39;t recall any blog being as much attacked for &quot;hey, this post doesn&#39;t meet my expectations&quot; as this one. It&#39;s as if people demand Raymond to be, do or say/write something, and thinking they&#39;re in their right and/or duty to do so.</p>

		<p>I like the non-technical posts, please don&#39;t stop them! Usually they&#39;re entertaining, and this one is entertaining in a meta-way.</p>
<p>I only skim the Win32 stuff because I rarely dip into Win32. I usually enjoy CLR week though. Also, the &quot;It involved being on the wrong side of the airtight hatch&quot; series is inspiring to me when it comes to secure programming, though it&#39;s usually pretty common-sense.</p>
<p>Point is Raymond has a diverse audience, so he has a diverse range of topics as well. There&#39;s something for everyone.</p>

		<p>@ John Doe: Hi. You assume bad faith unnecessarily. Apart from that, people *have* come to my blog and asked me why I wrote what I wrote. In fact I hold myself responsible to tell them. Curiosity shows regards. In other words, they actually care so much about my writing that ask me questions about it. Yet, somehow, you see all these as instance of childish exhibition of extreme disgust? I assure you, it is not intended.</p>
<p>As for your second question, no, I was a reader of Windows Confidential on MSDN magazine.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
</div><br/>
