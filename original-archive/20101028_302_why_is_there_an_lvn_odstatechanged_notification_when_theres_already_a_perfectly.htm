<p>If you <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/06/15/429338.aspx"> work with owner-data listviews</a>, you take the responsibility for managing the data associated with each item in the list view. The list view control itself only knows how many items there are; when it needs information about an item, it asks you for it. It's the fancy name for a "virtual list view" control.</p>
<p> When you use an ownerdata list view, you will receive a new notification, <code>LVN_ODSTATECHANGED</code>. The <i>OD</i> stands for ownerdata, so this is an "owner data state changed" notification. The list view sends this notification when the state of one or more items in an owner data list view control change simultaneously. Mind you, the list view control can also send the <code>LVN_ITEMCHANGED</code> notification if the state of an item changes, so you need to be on the lookout for both. </p>
<p> If there is a notification <code>LVN_ITEMCHANGED</code>, then what's the purpose of the <code>LVN_ODSTATECHANGED</code> message? It's redundant, after all. </p>
<p> Well yes, it's redundant, but it's faster, too. The <code>LVN_ODSTATECHANGED</code> notification tells you that the state of all items in the specified range has changed. It's a shorthand for sending an individual <code>LVN_ITEMCHANGED</code> for all items in the range [iFrom..iTo]. If you have an ownerdata list view with 500,000 items and somebody does a select-all, you'll be glad that you get a single <code>LVN_ODSTATECHANGED</code> notification with <code>iFrom=0</code> and <code>iTo=499999</code> instead of a half million individual little <code>LVN_ITEMCHANGED</code> notifications. </p>

		<p>If you have a listview with 500,000 items in it, that&#39;s quite a usability nightmare! &nbsp;Of course, your point still stands for a much more reasonable size like 5,000 items.</p>

		<p>@Adam Rosenfield: Not if you provide some &quot;instant filter&quot;, e.g. typing a filter term will reduce the list.</p>

		<p>It would be very useful if this message is sent even for regular controls (not owner-data). Imagine if you have to update the selection count like Explorer does in the status bar. If you do that on LVN_ITEMCHANGED, you will have to update it many times after a &quot;select all&quot;. With a single message like LVN_ODSTATECHANGED (or a new one LVN_SELCHANGED) life would be much easier.</p>
<p>What I&#39;ve done in the past was to post a private message on the first LVN_ITEMCHANGED and set a flag that stops further messages from being posted until the first message is received and processed. It works OK, but if it was done by the list control it would be more efficient.</p>

		<p>I had to deal with these two messages the other day, if you look at the structs the OD struct maps pretty good to the other struct so I did:</p>
<p>//deal with other changes?&#8230;</p>
<p>if (LVIF_STATE&amp;pNMLV-&gt;uChanged) {</p>
<p>NMLVODSTATECHANGE*pLVSC=(NMLVODSTATECHANGE*)pNMLV; //NMLVODSTATECHANGE is much smaller</p>
<p>pLVSC-&gt;iTo=pNMLV-&gt;iItem; //ok as long as LVN_ODSTATECHANGED is able to deal with iTo==-1</p>
<p>pLVSC-&gt;iFrom=(-1==pLVSC-&gt;iTo)?0:pLVSC-&gt;iTo;</p>
<p>goto &quot;handle_LVN_ODSTATECHANGED&quot;;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>A very weird bug I ran into while doing this was that sometimes NMLISTVIEW.iItem would be 16 in a list with 3 items. So I had to deal with both -1 and &gt;myItemCount</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
