<p> As an incompetent student of the Beethoven sonatas, I find these lectures absolutely riveting. </p>
<p> Note: Schiff assumes you are familiar with basic musical terminology, terms like <i>exposition</i>, <i>subdominant</i>, <i>Neapolitan</i>, <i>enharmonic</i> and <i>quaver</i>. </p>

		<p>Thanks for the link, I&#8217;ll check that out when I get home from work.</p>
<p>Musical analysis is always something that has really fascinated me but that I&#8217;ve never had the time to properly study. The perils of having too many interests.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been reading Charles Rosen&#8217;s book on the sonatas nightly, so this will be a nice companion. IMO, there is no greater music than the fuga of Op. 110. And for those who thought Scott Joplin was the genesis of Ragtime, they need to look 50 years earlier at Op. 111.</p>
<p>Truly an amazing, amazing body of work, all of them.</p>

		<p>These two talks about music (dipping into all sorts of other things on the way) are well worth watching if you haven&#8217;t already:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passion.html</a></p>

<p>I thought of mentioning them here before but figured it was a bit off-topic until now. Hope you enjoy them.</p>

		<p>&#8230;and Raymond&#8217;s spelling of the name is correct even though the linked page forgoes the accent. A nice and heartwarming touch (I&#8217;m Hungarian, as is Andr&#225;s Schiff).</p>

		<p>So, only having heard of Neapolitan ice cream, I thought I&#8217;d try my hand at non-musical definitions of those words:</p>
<p>exposition: entires from the Kama Sutra that you are no longer able to achieve</p>
<p>subdominant: type of person who likes to switch roles with another subdominant</p>
<p>Neapolitan: sexiest type of Italian</p>
<p>enharmonic: sound made by a couple reaching orgasm simultanously</p>
<p>quaver: what women do in the presence of a Neapolitan (q.v.)</p>

		<p>Neil,</p>
<p>Now, how about &#8216;recapitulation&#8217;?</p>

		<p>recapitulation: what you do after I continue to make these awful puns even though you&#8217;ve already asked me to stop once</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
