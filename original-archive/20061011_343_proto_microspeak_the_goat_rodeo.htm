		<p>Interesting. There is a Danish expression, &quot;gedemarked&quot;, i.e &quot;goat market&quot;, that has roughly the same meaning.</p>

		<p>Friends of mine have been using this term for 5 years or so. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not sure if it comes from the same place or not.</p>

		<p>Hmmm. I feel bad about even saying this, but the only time I&#8217;ve ever heard something like a &#8216;this is a goat #@*!&#8217; phrase then it sounds, um, a little more &#8216;vernacular&#8217;, but with basically the same meaning.</p>
<p>Using &#8216;rodeo&#8217; makes it a much nicer expression.</p>

		<p>Since at least 1970 the Air Force has used the term &quot;goat rope&quot; to mean the same thing, as in &quot;This exercise is a total goat rope&quot;.</p>

		<p>In 1997 or 1998, one of my confreres used this term to refer to Cisco&#8217;s collective development processes. Soon after that, our little group created an IRC channel #goatrodeo, which exists to this day.</p>

		<p>This is a term coined (or perhaps just used) by EdSt during the Win98 dev cycle. He had so many of these terms that DaveFe made a t-shirt with them on it.</p>

		<p>This term goes back at least as far as 1983 where it was a popular expression at a large pharmaceutical company in NJ.</p>

		<p>As for &quot;goat rope&quot;, the term &quot;goat roper&quot; was current in Denver about 30 or 35 years ago, used for someone who pretended to be a cowboy but wasn&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of a Tintin adventure where Haddock accuses Professor Calculus of &quot;acting the goat&quot;. Ah, Tintin . . .</p>

		<p>So &#8211; is &quot;baking&quot; here derived from silicon, or from Buffy? (&quot;I&#8217;m cookie dough&#8230; I&#8217;m not done baking yet&quot;)</p>

		<p>&quot;Baking&quot; was in use at Microsoft when I was there (90-00) so no, not 7th season Buffy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s derived from &quot;half-baked&quot;, actually :)</p>

		<p>My favorite is the term &quot;herding cats&quot; &nbsp;used to describe a group of unruly (prima donna) types who all want to go their own way&#8230;.you can imagine!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
