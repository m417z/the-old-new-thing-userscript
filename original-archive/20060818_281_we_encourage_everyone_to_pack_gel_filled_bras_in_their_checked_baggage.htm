		<p>It sounds funny at first, and I have no personal experience here, but my assumption is that these are worn by women who have had a mastectomy.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m more amused by the fact that women are allowed to take a small amount of breast milk. What are security going to do if they think the traveller&#8217;s breasts are looking a bit too &quot;loaded&quot;, hand them a breast pump and tell them to whap their baps out and get pumping?</p>

<p>They mean &quot;externally collected breast milk&quot;. A woman can carry any amount of milk in her breasts &#8211; but outside it, she has a limit.

		<p>I travelled the weekend of August 12th, right after the plot to blow up airliners over the Atlantic was discovered. &nbsp;I knew not to take shaving cream or shampoo, but at 3:30 in the morning, I wasn&#8217;t sure about deodorant, so I threw it in. I had to carry on everything because i was flying as a non-rev on a buddy pass. They kept my deoderant, but didn&#8217;t take a chapstick which they should have (twice). I saw a sign by a food place that said &quot;You can&#8217;t take drinks, but you CAN take food &#8211; grab a snack to go!. &nbsp;You can&#8217;t take jello or yogurt, but you can take a sandwhich. Wonder if they make you scrap the mayo off. &nbsp;You are allowed to take up to a 7 inch steel wrench and a corkscrew.</p>

		<p>Seems to me that if a woman was willing to blow herself up along with her bottle-fed infant, then that same woman would be willing to undergo an elective mastectomy so that she could wear an explosive gel-filled bra on board a plane.</p>
<p>If gels are a true safety threat, then I think we have to ask women to wear bulky sweaters or whatever they need to feel comfortable without a prosthetic gel bra. What did people do in the old days, before gel bras?</p>

		<p>Airports and Airplanes shall now be a clothes-free zone. &nbsp;You get to the airport, strip, and put all of your clothes in your checked baggage. &nbsp;Have a little lanyard for your boarding pass and ID. &nbsp;Go through security very very quickly. &nbsp;Get on the plane.</p>
<p>Security is extremely easy that way.</p>

		<p>And what about silicone implants? How are *they* going to be tested??</p>
<p>Mr O&#8217;Leary ridiculed the notion of searching five- or six-year-old children and elderly people in wheelchairs going to Spain. Such scenes, he said, would have &quot;terrorists laughing in the caves of Afghanistan&quot;<br />

		<p>A clothes-free zone? &nbsp;That&#8217;s all? &nbsp;You forgot to mention the fact that potential passengers will be sequestered for 5 days to make sure they are not carrying any bomb-making fluid filled condoms in their alimentary canal. &nbsp;Furthermore, the mandatory full body CAT and MRI scans will help detect any surgically implanted explosives.</p>
<p>Anyhow, they *do* give you a free tyvek robe in a nice orange color for the flight so what are you complaining about?<br /></p>

		<p>Given the recent news that breast implants saved a woman&#8217;s life after being hit by shrapnel, I have a proposal. As an anti-terrorism measure, padded bras should be handed out free by airlines, to all those who lack sufficient natural padding in that area.</p>

		<p>The concept of stripping and having a cloth- free airport/airplane zone is an idea which should be explored by authorities. Even the terrorists would give up terror and the ailing airline industry will have a comeback :)</p>

<p>Absolutely. &nbsp;We lose 40,000 people every year on our roads and 30,000 every year to the flu. &nbsp;Yet we lose 3000 once and suddenly everything has to change. &nbsp;The pendulum has swung much too far the other way.

		<p>why dont we just avoid all this and drive?</p>
<p>well, that gives us another problem, first of all, you cant drive over the ocean. and the second is that the security workers would have no job and have to start a new program for highway security and check you every half mile on the highways for bombs and stuff&#8230;<br />

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
