<p>The party game goes by many names. <i>Hippie poetry</i>, <i>Beat poetry</i>, <i>Dada poetry</i>. To play, have a group of people sit in a circle and give each person a piece of paper and writing implement. To start, each person writes a single line of poetry and hands it to the person to his or her left or right. (The direction isn't important, as long as it's consistent.)</p>
<p> At each round, you add one line to the growing poem, then fold over the top of the page so that only the line you added is visible. Pass the paper to the left (or right), and repeat. Popular stopping conditions are when the paper is full or when the page returns to the person who started the poem. Once the poem is complete, the paper is unfolded and everyone takes turns reading the results. They are usually quite absurd. </p>
<p> That was a long and ultimately unsatisfying set-up for the fact that you can make money playing this game. And you do it via the Internet from your home. The catch: You get paid four cents per line. Oh, and <a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/commentary/sexdrive/2006/12/72269"> the poem is about sex</a>. </p>

		<p>I wonder what kinds of results Hippy Programming would produce?</p>

		<p>Semi-open source. Would be nasty. All the weaknesses of both camps. I&#8217;m thinking Lotus Notes applications. :-)</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m a Notes developer and admin so I&#8217;m entitled to say that. The rest of you, back off&#8230; ;-) )</p>

		<p>This sounds like yet another variant of the Telephone X games. &nbsp;See, for example, Telephone Pictionary (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.mbinde.com/games/telephone-pictionary/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mbinde.com/games/telephone-pictionary/</a>), where you alternate between drawing a picture of a sentence and writing a sentence about a picture.</p>
<p>But getting paid for it, and writing about sex, that&#8217;s certainly a new twist.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen a shorter variant.</p>
<p>Each people playing the game choose a card that contains &quot;Who&quot;, &quot;When&quot;, &quot;Where&quot;, &quot;What&quot; and &quot;Why (what for)&quot;. Then each of them write their part without talking to the others. 2 minutes later they build a sentence with the parts. The result could be quite absurd too. :)</p>

		<p>A forum I used to frequently regularly has a &quot;four word story&quot; meme. Each of the participants adds four words to the story.</p>
<p>They inevitably end up being about sex. I should add at this point: the participants are pretty much exclusively male :p</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
