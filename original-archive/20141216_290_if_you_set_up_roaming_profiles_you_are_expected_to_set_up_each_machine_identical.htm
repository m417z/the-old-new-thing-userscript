<p>A customer discovered the following behavior when they set up roaming user profiles on their domain. Consider two machines, 1&nbsp;and&nbsp;2. An application&nbsp;A is installed on machine&nbsp;1, but not machine&nbsp;2. A user with a roaming profile logs onto machine&nbsp;1 and pins application&nbsp;A to the taskbar. That user then logs off of machine&nbsp;1 and logs onto machine&nbsp;2.</p>
<p> Now things get interesting: The taskbar on machine&nbsp;2 initially shows a white icon on the taskbar, representing the nonexistent application&nbsp;A. A short time later, that icon vanishes. When the user logs off of machine&nbsp;2 and back onto machine&nbsp;1, the pinned icon is missing on machine&nbsp;1, too. </p>
<p> The white icon is deleted automatically by the system because it sees that you pinned an application which is not installed, so it unpins it too. This general rule is to handle the case where you install an application and pin it, then somebody else unninstalls it. The taskbar removes the now-broken icon to reflect the fact that the application is no longer installed. There's no point having a shortcut to a nonexisting program, and it relieves application vendors the impossible task of cleaning up pinned icons upon uninstall. (It's impossible because some users who pinned the application may not have their profile locally present because it roamed to another machine. Or worse, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/06/30/434209.aspx"> the uninstaller tries to edit a profile that is not active and ends up corrupting the master copy when the two versions reconcile</a>.) </p>
<p> The user profiles team explained that one of the assumptions behind classic roaming user profiles is that the machines participating in roaming be semantically identical: They must be running the same operating system on the same processor architecture. They must have the same set of applications installed into the same locations. And they must have the same drive letter layout. </p>
<p> But that's just classical roaming profiles. There are other roaming profile solutions, such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enterprise/products-and-technologies/mdop/ue-v.aspx"> User Experience Virtualization</a>, which may meet the customer's needs better. (I'm told that there are also third-party roaming solutions, though I don't know of any offhand, this not being my area of expertise.) </p>

<p>Ha-ha-ha-ha, thank you, it made my Tuesday evening, especially the drive letters part. On a serious note, why does the system even bother to remove broken shortcuts? The user put them there, not the system, so keep your hands away from them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that difficult in a heavily managed environment like a school (especially since they have summer to update ALL THE MACHINES in one fell swoop).</p>
<p>On the other hand, it takes them 6 weeks of downime to update anything.</p>

		<p>Oh, wonders of automatic shortcut cleanup! If you ever made a shortcut to a network share, it will disappear after some time. Surprise! The shortcut cleanup task runs NOT under your account, and when it&#39;s trying to access a network location, it fails. So it decides that the shortcut goes nowhere, and deletes it. Thanks, Ballmer.</p>
<p>Who ever thought that this cleanup will be a good idea at all?</p>

		<p>this is why folder mappings should be used, and carefully at that.</p>
<p>My Documents : map that to the same folder</p>
<p>Desktop : probably map to the same folder as well (I have a tendency to hate desktop icons for apps &#8211; that&#39;s what the start menu is for).</p>
<p>Start Menu : Map that to a machine-name subfolder.</p>
<p>This can be applied using GPOs as well, for even greater consistency. Then make sure that the redirected folders are configured to allow offline synchronization. With this done, the remaining &quot;roaming profile&quot; is pretty minimal.</p>

		<p>If it didn&#39;t cleanup shortcuts you would all be complaining instead about how Windows is too lazy/dumb to do this obvious cleanup, so there is no way to win here.</p>

		<p>@Joker_vD: what about shortcuts as created by a program installer? &nbsp;They&#39;re not made by the user, but rather, by an application acting on behalf of the user. &nbsp;The user didn&#39;t request the shortcut, it just appeared when they installed a new app. &nbsp;Experience tells me that the uninstaller program won&#39;t clean up the shortcuts that the installer threw up all over the shell. &nbsp;In this case, I&#39;d rather have the automatic cleanup process remove those dead links.</p>

		<p>When the guy who updated our company workgroup to a Windows domain enabled roaming profiles it would have been helpful to know that or have him explain that to us. &nbsp;We had all sorts of odd behaviors after that. &nbsp;Fortunately most users only ever used one workstation with one Windows version, so most of those issues never popped up. &nbsp;For a while I had an icon for IE x64 in my 32-bit Win XP Quick Launch toolbar.</p>

		<p>@Kirby FC : There no way for those program to know their shortcuts are being copied because all software is installed using template user profile, and then the user profile is copied to &quot;Default&quot; user, so any newly created logins keep their copies.</p>

		<p>This feature is one of Microsoft engineering goofs. Links on the taskbar are limited; the user can be trusted to do the health checking manually: He clicks, finds out the link is not working and deletes it. In addition, the arbitrary health check can be done by Programs and Features after each uninstallation instead of once at each logon.</p>
<p>Now, such checks would have made perfect sense if they were made on file association entries in Windows Registry. e.g. if File Explorer deleted each incorrect file association upon loading them, it would have been great.</p>

		<p>If I attempt to open a desktop shortcut that points to something that doesn&#39;t exist, Explorer may ask if the shortcut should be deleted. &nbsp;I think that same behavior for pinned items would have been preferable to automatic deletion. &nbsp;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
