In 1966, the Swedish town of G&auml;vle
started the tradition of erecting a giant goat made of straw
for the Christmas holiday season,
and it continues to be the leading example of same.
This sounds weird out of context, but a Christmas goat made of straw
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule_Goat">
is a long-standing Swedish tradition</a>.
</p>
<p>
Anyway,
the tradition began in 1966, so the goat is now 50 years old.
(Note: Not actually the same goat. Because read on.)
</p>
<p>
As the goat himself
<a HREF="http://merjuligavle.blogspot.com/">
blogged</a>,
"<a HREF="http://merjuligavle.blogspot.com/2016/11/torsdag-24-november-im-bock.html"
>I'm bock</a>."&sup1;
The G&auml;vle Goat also
<a HREF="https://twitter.com/gavlebocken">tweets</a>,
in both Swedish and English,
and it has
<a HREF="https://www.instagram.com/gavlebocken/">
an Instagram account</a>.
</p>
<p>
The G&auml;vle Goat is famous for many things.
It's an annual tradition.
It holds the Guiness world record for
<a HREF="http://www.visitgavle.se/en/the-gavlegoat-0">
the largest straw goat</a>.
It has
<a HREF="http://www.visitgavle.se/sv/gavlebocken">
a round-the-clock webcam</a>.
And most years, vandals burn it down.
(Wikipedia has
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A4vle_goat">
a rundown of the goat's fate in nearly every year of its existence</a>.)
</p>

Previously</a>.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
This is a multilingual pun (my favorite kind).
The G&auml;vle Goat goes by the Swedish name
<i>G&auml;vlebocken</i>.
which means, um, "The G&auml;vle Goat."
The Swedish word for goat is <i>bock</i>.</p>

		<p>Actually, the Swedish word &#8220;bock&#8221; (or more specifically, &#8220;getabock&#8221;), in this context, is a *male* goat. The word for a goat of either gender is &#8220;get&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The burning of the goat seems to be as traditional as the goat itself.</p>

		<p>The burning *is* another tradition. It&#8217;s like a game. The vandals try to burn the goat, and the city tries to prevent it. Given how easy it is to burn a straw structure that sits in the middle of a big square (my favorite one was the 2005 burning, using a fire arrow thrown by a man dressed like Santa Claus), you can guess which party is going to lose more often :-) .</p>

		<p>Kitty cats notwithstanding, goats are kind of a black hole of YouTube. (Goat meets horse&#8230; sad about the whole human captivity thing, but you get that on earth. m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij85jFpNRpw &#8230;. and then there&#8217;s Peggy the three legged racing goat from a few years ago. So cute.</p>

		<p>&#8230;aaaand, Wikipedia reports that the goat has been destroyed before its time, again, and will not be rebuilt this year.</p>
<p>For years, my band played a private party in December that was meant to be a celebration of several friends&#8217; Capricorn birthdays. A high point was always the burning of, you guessed it, the effigy of a goat. Once the goat was done, we could start our show.  Always a fun time. Sadly, the organizers decided to call a halt to the yearly ritual, and even worse, the last one ended in a fizzle: freezing rain made it hard to get to the site, and just as we pulled in to the driveway, the power went out.  Thus passed the glory of the Goat Party.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
