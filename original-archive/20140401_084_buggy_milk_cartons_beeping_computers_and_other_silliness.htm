<p>Some time ago, there was a performance-related bug that went something like this:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> <b>mm/dd/yy Created by bob</b><br> The attached file contains a dataset that takes a very long time to process. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The engineer who fixed the problem decided to take the cryptic approach: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  <b>mm/dd/yy Resolved as fixed by alice</b><br> It <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130515195048/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGotBetter"> got better</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> It was a common practice during highly stressful periods to file humorous bugs in the defect tracking system, and once the initial bug was filed, it turned into a sort of collaborative performance effort. </p>
<p> For some reason, milk is often a trigger. </p>
<p> Many years ago, the vendor who supplies milk to Microsoft changed the design of their milk cartons, and the new cartons were significantly harder to open than the old cartons. (Apparently they bought a new machine, and the glue level needed to be tuned.) This naturally inspired people to do what they usually do when they see something amiss: File a bug. </p>
<p> More than one person was inspired to file a milk carton bug, but probably the most famous one is the one <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/korbyp/archive/2003/10/10/54208.aspx"> reprinted by Korby Parnell back in 2003</a>. </p>
<p> Kraig Brockschmidt describes <a href="http://www.kraigbrockschmidt.com/mm/Chapter02.htm#_ftn5"> an earlier milk carton bug</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> A friend of mine who worked as a tester on Microsoft Excel once logged a bug against the cartons of milk in the free drink coolers. He noticed that the chocolate milk failed to list the ingredient "cocoa" whereas the plain 2% milk did. An intense discussion in raid [the defect tracking system] over the relative merits of these "features" continued for three or four weeks and involved as many as a fifteen different engineers. I think it set some kind of record. Anyway, someone finally went so far as to notify the dairy itself and the bug was closed as "<span style="font-variant: small-caps">won't fix&mdash;assigned to vendor</span>." </p>
</blockquote>
<p> (In the years since the original story occurred, our defect tracking system gained a new resolution class, and today it would be resolved as "<span style="font-variant: small-caps">external&mdash;assigned to vendor</span>.") </p>
<p> Over in the languages group, there was a bug that went roughly "IDE fails to beep when build is finished." Nobody can find a copy of the bug any more, it having been archived away ages ago, but one of my colleagues recalls that it went something like this: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><ul>
<li>Start a build. </li>
<li>Leave office to get a beverage from the kitchen. </li>
<li>Return to office. </li>
<li>Observe that build has finished, but no beep was heard. </li>
</ul>
<p>  One person resolved the bug "Not Repro" because they stood just outside the office and clearly heard the beep, but that led to a debate over how far from the office you needed to be in order to reproduce the bug. Things got sillier and sillier until someone finally closed the bug after claiming to have taken their computer out to the forest behind the building and started the compilation. When they returned 30 minutes later, they found that a tree had fallen on the machine. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I admire the philosophical resolution to that one. </p>

		<p>Hey, my chocolate milk bug! &nbsp;That happened somewhere between 1993 and 1995. &nbsp;If I remember correctly, an Excel developer, Ross, called up Darigold to tell them about the issue. &nbsp;It took well over a month before the &quot;fixed&quot; cartons of milk actually showed up in the coolers.</p>

		<p>At one time, our WarTeam demanded that any server down time have a bug associated with it, for tracking purposes.</p>
<p>This led to this bug:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;To repro:</p>
<p>	&#8211; Upgrade server</p>
<p>	&#8211; Wait for 6 days</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Result:</p>
<p>	&#8211; Spontaneous combustion in the uninterruptible power supply</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Expected:</p>
<p>	&#8211; Power to stay up</p>
<p>After being bounced around a few teams, it was eventually resolved &quot;Not Repro&quot;.</p>

		<p>One bug I&#39;ve seen go by was titled something like &quot;My server ate my build CD&quot;. What had happened is someone, when doing an install on a HP DL380 (probably a G4) server, had managed to miss the laptop-style CD tray and instead had slid the CD into the gap between the top of the drive and the case such that it disappeared into the server. They then ended up rather confused for a bit trying to work out where the CD had gone.</p>

		<p>Actually the chocolate milk bug is more serious than you might expect. Incorrect ingredients is a violation of FDA food labeling regulations. Of course people would expect cocoa in chocolate milk, but there are semi-regular recalls for stuff that might cause allergies like undeclared nuts.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
