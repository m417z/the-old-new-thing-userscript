<p>Commenter Kevin Eshbach asks <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#569387"> why you cannot programatically change the text centering style of an edit control after the control has been created</a>.</p>
<p> The edit control is one of the original window manager controls, so it comes with a lot of history. First thing to note is that the <code>WM_STYLECHANGED</code> message did not exist until Windows&nbsp;95. The edit control predates Windows&nbsp;95 by over a decade, so the short answer is "It can't respond to the change in styles because it doesn't even know that you changed them!" </p>
<p> Back in the old days, the only time a control was informed of its styles was in the <code>CREATESTRUCT</code> passed as parameters to the <code>WM_CREATE</code> and <code>WM_NCCREATE</code> messages. Consequently, most controls back in those days cached their styles in member variables so that they wouldn't have to call <code>GetWindowLong(GWL_STYLE)</code> all the time. This was back in the days of 4.77MHz CPUs, and a call to fetch the style of a window was quite a bit bigger and slower than just reading it out of your local data segment. </p>
<p> Even if you decided "Forget it, I won't bother with a cache; I'll just call <code>GetWindowLong(GWL_STYLE)</code> to read the style each time I need it", you open yourself up to a new problem: What if the style changes? A change in the style means that the characters in the edit box need to have their positions recalculated and the text redrawn. This is obviously not something you want to do at every single message (redrawing at every message is probably not a great idea), so you still need to cache the old style so you can avoid recalculating stuff that hasn't changed. </p>
<p> Even if you say, "Okay, fine, then instead of changing the style with <code>SetWindowLong(GWL_STYLE)</code>, let's say that if you want to change the style of an edit control, you have to use a new message, something like <code>EM_CHANGESTYLE</code>." That way, the edit control knows when its styles have changed and doesn't have to keep polling for them. When it gets this message, it updates the styles and recalculates all its internal state based on the new style. </p>
<p> Okay, sure it could've done this, but that's code that <a href="http://blog.ryjones.org/2005/07/12/product-development/"> has to be written and tested</a>, for an extremely rare usage pattern. I mean, what is the scenario where somebody needs to change an edit control from left-aligned to right-aligned on the fly? You could count all the Windows&nbsp;1.0 applications on your fingers and toes (note: exaggeration), and they just decided in the dialog template which way the text should be aligned. It was determined not just at creation time; it was determined at <i>compile time</i>. </p>
<p> If you want to change an edit control's alignment on the fly, you can just destroy the old one and create a new one in its place with the same text. </p>

		<p>This caught me out recently. I was writing a dialog rendering wrapper to prevent flickering when the dialog is resized, and found that comboboxes set the ES_NOHIDESEL style on their edit control. All well and dandy but it means that if you use WM_PRINTCLIENT to print a combobox into a memory DC it will do so with the text in it highlighted, even if the control doesn&#8217;t actually have focus.</p>
<p>Clearing the ES_NOHIDESEL style for the WM_PRINTCLIENT didn&#8217;t work because, as I&#8217;ve now learned, the edit control doesn&#8217;t update on style change. The only solution I found was to manually clear the selection range via CB_SETEDITSEL and restore it after rendering.</p>

		<p>&gt; The edit control predates Windows 95 by over a decade</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy the legacy argument.</p>
<p>Microsoft continues controls development way after they were first introduced.</p>
<p>e.g. The multi-line edit control now supports the mouse wheel.</p>
<p>&gt; Okay, sure it could&#8217;ve done this, but that&#8217;s code that has to be written and tested, for an extremely rare usage pattern.</p>
<p>That is the real reason.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>The legacy argument is to answer the question &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t the edit control support the feature from conception?&#8221; Because adding features later is much more expensive than designing them in. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>@Cheong:</p>
<p>He&#8217;s already referring to finger binary. &nbsp;Try to express binary 01010 on one hand using finger binary. &nbsp;It&#8217;s hard. &nbsp;Physically difficult.</p>
<p>As other commenters have mentioned, finger binary is also not even close to a maximal representation of hand counting. &nbsp;And it makes me have to perform a retranslation step (binary to decimal) at the end of the count which is usually more difficult than counting without my hands.</p>
<p>On the rare occasion that I do count or store a number with my hands I use American Sign Language <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/counting-on-numbers-in-sign-language.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/counting-on-numbers-in-sign-language.html</a>, except that I don&#8217;t do the funny business from 11-19, just handling it the same way as 21-29, 31-39, etc. &nbsp;Slightly less efficient than finger binary, but it also serves as an example of some of the ways you can create even more hand states than just finger raised/finger lowered.</p>
<p>Which adds nothing constructive to Raymond&#8217;s post. &nbsp;Just wanted to nitpick, and I found somebody that wasn&#8217;t Raymond.</p>

		<p>Thanks for answering the question Raymond. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve had bugs to fix in the past where people where changing the text alignment style via SetWindowLong and then wondering why things started to act wacky and when I told them you cannot this style after the edit control is created they just stared at me like a mental patient.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d still test it before assuming it doesn&#8217;t support it. &nbsp;When you call SetWindowLong to change styles, as a rule you have to call SetWindowPos with SWP_FRAMECHANGED, as mentioned above. If you don&#8217;t will it not work well with for anything. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>ulric,</p>
<p>Looking at the documentation for the SetWindowPos at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633545" target=_new rel=nofollow rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633545</a>(VS.85).aspx I see nothing saying that the SWP_FRAMECHANGED flag will cause the control to be destroyed and re-created as Raymond stated is the correct way to change an edit control&#8217;s text alignment on the fly.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Huh? I see no such text on the page you link to. SWP_FRAMECHANGED does not &#8220;destroy and recreate content&#8221; &#8211; how could it? (How would SWP_FRAMECHANGED know how to recreate the contents of a grid control?) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Keven Eshbash: &nbsp;what SetWindowPos does is end up cause a WM_NCCALCSIZE, and well-behaved controls watch for that message to re-calculate their layouts according to their styles. &nbsp;A window has no other way to know the styles have been changed through SetWindowLong.</p>
<p>(this comments on the question as much as the EM_CHANGESTYLE paragraph)</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find that information in the documentation for SetWindowLong, in the remark section, but if you use MFC CWnd::ModifyStyles it calls SetWindowPos internally for you.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s exactly what Kevin just said. &nbsp;Since the only way to change the style is to destroy and recreate the control, and SWP_FRAMECHANGED doesn&#8217;t destroy and recreate the control, SWP_FRAMECHANGED won&#8217;t change the style.</p>

		<p>Following the &#8220;Don&#8217;t be lazy&#8221; doctrine.. :P</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a test application,</p>
<p>and as I predicted, you can indeed change the alignement of an edit control at runtime. &nbsp;It works, therefore this blog entry is wrong.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>I wrote an MFC dialog with two buttons to modify the style of the edit control. here are the message handlers:</p>
<p>void CTestEditDlg::OnBnClickedButton1()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>m_TestEdit.ModifyStyle( ES_RIGHT, ES_LEFT );</p>
<p>m_TestEdit.Invalidate();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>void CTestEditDlg::OnBnClickedButton2()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>m_TestEdit.ModifyStyle( ES_LEFT, ES_RIGHT );</p>
<p>m_TestEdit.Invalidate();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>MFC&#8217;s ModifyStyle does SetWindowLong and SetWindowPos( SWP_FRAMCHANGED)</p>

		<p>All I know is I can&#8217;t find anything in the official Microsoft documentation where it states you can dynamically change the alignment style on the fly so in my opinion that means if it works it&#8217;s an undocumented feature that could disappear in future versions of Windows. &nbsp;I personally prefer to stay away from undocumented features but to each his own.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
