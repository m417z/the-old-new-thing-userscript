<p> The Windows group has its own domain (known as <code>NTDEV</code> for historical reasons) which operates separately from the domain forest operated by the Microsoft&nbsp;IT department. Various trust relationships need to be set up between them so that people on the Windows team can connect to resources managed by the Microsoft IT department and vice versa, but it generally works out okay. </p>

<p> It's pretty simple, really. </p>
<p> If you want to have trouble accessing NTDEV resources, then join the REDMOND domain. </p>

		<p>Switch domains every day, so that on even numbered days you are joined to one domain, and on odd-numbered days you are on another&#8230;. &nbsp;That should be implemented as a feature of the OS!</p>

		<p>At one place I worked back in the NT4 days, one network admin I worked with (I was the other) liked to put every server in its own domain. Better security of course! I didn&#39;t work there very long&#8230;</p>

		<p>So its called NTDEV for historical reasons, is that to say its the same domain since NT? upgraded through every version? or has it been recreated?</p>

		<p>@Chris: I&#39;d think DC upgrade is a scenario they won&#39;t miss for chance of dogfooding.</p>
<p>I&#39;d suspect they also have built internal tool for schema cleanup.</p>

		<p>@Alex:</p>
<p>By default, Active Directory allows domain users to join up to 10 computers to a domain.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this &quot;feature&quot; surprises quite a few domain administrators (myself included several years ago).</p>

<p>Maybe have your own test setups? As far as I heard MS IT is very very anal regarding security. Letting the users screw around with domain computers is not something I would expect there.</p>

		<p>@alegr1: Except if these &quot;users&quot; are those who write AD infrastructure?</p>
<p>It&#39;s like when your company&#39;s AD have problem, your company&#39;s IT will call Microsoft support if they have support quota left. It&#39;s not unlikely that when Microsoft IT department encountered problem in AD, they&#39;ll call people working on AD infrastructure directly, and have touch on domain level settings in the process.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if they really have access or what, but even if they have access, I&#39;d think it&#39;s quite understandable.</p>

		<p>@alegr1: I agree that they shouldn&#39;t meddle with the actual domain they use daily, but testing setup is just a testing setup, it won&#39;t get the usage level (read &quot;test coverage&quot;) of a domain server you actually use. So I think while maybe they don&#39;t do this often, they&#39;d tweak it some time, especially if a new built is made. They have to make sure the basic functions works fine.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
