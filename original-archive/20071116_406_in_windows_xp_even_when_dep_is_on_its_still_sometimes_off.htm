As we saw last time</a>,
there are a variety of ways you can control DEP,
one of which is to turn it on for all system processes.
But even if you turn on DEP, it still sometimes turns itself off
temporarily.
It goes back to those bad versions of ATL.
</p>
<p>
The application compatibility team found that 
there were so many programs written with application frameworks
that were not DEP-compatible (ATL mostly, but a few others)
that nobody would actually enable DEP because the odds were close
to 100% that there would be some program on the system that was
not DEP-ready.
Even DEP-fan Leo Davidson
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/11/15/6234771.aspx#6268409">
runs a couple of programs that don't work with DEP enabled</a>.
And
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/20/1109012.aspx">
it takes only one program to foul an upgrade</a>.
</p>
<p>
When the kernel encounters a DEP exception,
it checks whether thunk emulation is enabled,
and if so (which it usually is),
it checks whether the code sequence is
one of the "well-known DEP-violating thunks".
If so, then it simulates the actions the thunks would have performed
and resumes execution instead of raising the exception.
For example, if thunk emulation is enabled and you just took a
DEP exception on the code sequence
</p>
<pre>
mov ecx, 12345678
jmp 43218765
</pre>
<p>
the kernel thunk emulator will perform the moral equivalent of
</p>
<pre>
pContext-&gt;Ecx = 0x12345678;
pContext-&gt;Eip = 0x43218765;
return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION;
</pre>
<p>
You can mark your program as
"I am so okay with DEP that not only do I want you to enable it,
but I don't even want you to do this thunk emulation stuff"
by setting the
<code>IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_NX_COMPAT</code>
flag in your PE header.
(The Visual Studio linker uses the <code>/NXCOMPAT</code>
command line switch to set this flag.)</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s kind of ironic. &nbsp;Code uses thunks to save a few cycles. &nbsp;The thunk emulator and associated exception come along and steal rather more than a few cycles.</p>

		<p>You&#8217;ve got me worried now Raymond.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been marking my latest code as /NXCOMPAT, because I&#8217;m sure my code doesn&#8217;t get the IP on the stack.</p>
<p>But now, I assume that if some bad printer driver, or hook proc hooks into my software, and is based on the old ATL stuff, my software will now crash. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I right to be worried?</p>

		<p>Whoops, scrub that, the offending EIP is on the heap and so the kernel can&#8217;t possibly trace it to the DLL that put it there.</p>

<p>Useful, robust but not undefeatable. Coupled with newer compilers with stack protection, it gets much better if not impossible to defeat.</p>

		<p>If I understand what you are saying, then doesn&#8217;t it defeat the purpose of DEP? The evil exploit writers will simply write their code so that it matches one of the &#8220;well-known thunk&#8221; pattern and pass through DEP.</p>
<p>(I understand that DEP is not a cure-all for exploit anyway, but what it does protects against is defeated by this feature, it would seem.)</p>
<p>(It still makes writing the exploit harder, though, and defeat earlier ones.)</p>
<div class="post">[<i>The well-known thunks don&#8217;t do anything other than twiddle some registers and then jump somewhere else. DEP still applies to that &#8220;somewhere else&#8221;. All you gained was the ability to control the contents of the ECX register. That&#8217;s hardly arbitrary code execution. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Just because you don&#8217;t see a way to exploit it doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t any. Even uninitialised variables can pose a security risk.</p>
<p>Anyway, does anyone know how to set DllCharacteristics in mingw32? I think i&#8217;m gonna have to binary patch the exe from the makefile (maybe with dd), i&#8217;d rather not make my own build if i can avoid it.</p>

		<p>The point is that a memory overwrite resulting in a thunk lookalike is basically just as bad as any other data overwrite where you replace an existing function pointer directly, and there are lots of function pointers in writable memory. This doesn&#8217;t open a new class of exploits, it only extends the set of possible addresses for an existing one ever so slightly. As the whole point of DEP is to reduce the consequences of a security breach that&#8217;s already happened, that seems quite ok.</p>

		<p>The pocketpc emulator in visual studio 2003 doesn&#8217;t run if windows have dep (globally) enabled. Why? Wasn&#8217;t XPSP2 developed with this compiler? How incompetent must someone be to develop software with a compiler that doesn&#8217;t work with the compiler?</p>

		<p>Interesting to learn about thunk emulation on DEP exceptions.</p>
<p>I wonder why the Windows Vista Sidebar team doesn&#8217;t do this for Sidebar gadgets that use ActiveX controls that were built with old ATL. &nbsp;Old ActiveX controls that work fine under IE crash Vista Sidebar.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
