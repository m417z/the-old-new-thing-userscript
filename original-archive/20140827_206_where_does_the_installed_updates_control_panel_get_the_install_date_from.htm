<p>A corporate customer wanted to know where the <i>Installed Updates</i> control panel gets the <i>Installed On</i> information from, because they found that the values were always set to the current date regardless of when the update was actually installed.</p>
<p> The algorithm goes roughly like this: </p>
<p> First, ask MSI what date the update was installed by calling <code>Msi&shy;Get&shy;PatchInfo&shy;Ex</code> and asking for the <code>INSTALL&shy;PROPERTY_<wbr>INSTALL&shy;DATE</wbr></code>. </p>
<p> If that doesn't work, then go to the registry key under <code>Software\<wbr>Microsoft\<wbr>Windows\<wbr>Current&shy;Version\<wbr>Uninstall\<wbr><u>Unique&shy;Id</u></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></code> and look for a value called (surprise) <code>Install&shy;Date</code>. (Note that 32-bit updates on 64-bit machines will be redirected into a <code>Wow&shy;64&shy;32&shy;Node</code> key.) </p>
<p> If that still doesn't work, then it's time to guess: Windows&nbsp;XP uses the last-modified date of the directory that contains the uninstaller. Windows Vista and higher use the last-modified date of the <code>Software\<wbr>Microsoft\<wbr>Windows\<wbr>Current&shy;Version\<wbr>Uninstall\<wbr><u>Unique&shy;Id</u></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></code> registry key. (Again, possibly with a <code>Wow&shy;64&shy;32&shy;Node</code> stuck in there.) </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: Interestingly, the customer didn't phrase the problem like that. The customer said, "The first time a user logs on each day, the install date changes to the current date. Subsequent logons the same day do not change the date. But the first logon the next day changes the date again. What's so special about the first logon of each day?" What's so special about the first logon of each day is that it's a new day! I suspect that the the date is updated on <i>every</i> logon. It's just that they don't notice the change because the date is the same. </p>

		<p>OMG! I&#39;ve noticed the same bug in .Net&#39;s DateTime.Today property! The first time I call it on a particular day, the day changes! What&#39;s so special about the first time I call it on each day? In fact, this one gets worse! The first time I call it in a particular month, the month changes! Happens for years, too!</p>

		<p>Dilbert commentary on this situation: sometimes it&#39;s necessary to revoke the customer&#39;s computer use privileges and provide them with an Etch-a-Sketch instead.</p>
<p>If that isn&#39;t possible, blacklisting the email should at least save you from despairing over the world&#39;s general comprehension of logic, or lack thereof.</p>

		<p>This is pretty much off topic, but does anyone know why Windows Update uses so much RAM? &nbsp;It will happily use hundreds of megabytes, and if there aren&#39;t that many megs free, it will start to page, and eventually thrash. &nbsp;My computer just rebooted from installing today&#39;s security update, and all windows update had to do was tell me &quot;install successful&quot;. &nbsp;Task manager says it needed half a gig to do this, on a two gig machine.</p>

		<p>@MarkVY: To check the signature of the Windows Update it needs to compute the Authenticode hash of the file, which means mapping the entire file into memory.</p>

		<p>@Xv8: The .NET thing is mostly a disk space hog though, not a memory hog. &nbsp;The record space-used that I&#39;ve seen is 3.5GB required to apply a 14MB update (this was on machines that were at close to capacity, or at least that didn&#39;t have the 3,500 megabytes of space needed to install a 14 megabyte update).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
