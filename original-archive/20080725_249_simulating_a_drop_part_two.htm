<p>
Last time, we wrote a tiny program to simulate dropping a file
on another file,
but we discovered that it didn't work for dropping a file
onto
<code>Mail Recipient.MAPIMail</code>.
The reason, as you no doubt instantly recognized,
is that the <code>MAPIMail</code> handler creates a worker thread,
and we're exiting the process before the worker thread has finished
its work.
</p>
<p>
And as you no doubt know by now, the solution is to use the
<code>SHSetInstanceExplorer</code> function.
Let's bring back
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/28/8555658.aspx">
the <code>ProcessReference</code> class</a>
and use it to solve our process lifetime problem.
</p>
<pre>
int __cdecl wmain(int argc, WCHAR **argv)
{
 <i><font COLOR=blue>ProcessReference ref;</font></i>
 ...
</pre>
<p>
Compile this program and run it with the command line
</p>
<pre>
fakedrop c:\autoexec.bat "%USERPROFILE%\SendTo\Mail Recipient.MAPIMail"
</pre>
<p>
to watch our process reference save the day.
</p>
<p>
Oh wait, it didn't help. What's going on?
</p>
<p>
Run this under the debugger and you'll see an interesting exception:
</p>
<pre>
(918.110): Unknown exception - code 80010012 (first chance)
</pre>
<p>
A little hunting through <code>winerror.h</code> reveals what
this exception means:
</p>
<pre>
//
// MessageId: RPC_E_SERVER_DIED_DNE
//
// MessageText:
//
//  The callee (server [not server application]) is not available and
//  disappeared; all connections are invalid. The call did not execute.
//
#define RPC_E_SERVER_DIED_DNE            _HRESULT_TYPEDEF_(0x80010012L)
</pre>
<p>
Huh? What's this RPC stuff?
Oh wait, COM uses RPC.
That should be a clue.
</p>
<p>
Notice that our <code>ProcessReference</code>'s destructor
runs after we have already uninitialized COM.
When we invoked the <code>IDropTarget::Drop</code> method on the
<code>MAPIMail</code> drop target,
it kicked off a background thread to do the work,
and in order to access the parameters from the background thread,
it had to do a bit of marshalling,
with the help of the functions with ridiculously long names
<code>CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream</code>
and the only slightly less ridiculous
<code>CoGetInterfaceAndReleaseStream</code>.
But since we tear down COM immediately,
when the background thread gets around to asking,
"Okay, and what was that file name?"
the thread that has the answer (the main thread) has already
shut down COM.
Hence the "server died" error.
</p>
<p>
To fix this, we need to fix the scope of the process reference
object:
</p>
<pre>
 if (argc == 3 &amp;&amp; SUCCEEDED(CoInitialize(NULL))) {
  <i><font COLOR=blue>ProcessReference ref;</font></i>
  ...
</pre>
<p>
Compile this program and run it with the same command line and...
it still doesn't work!
But this time you definitely know why:
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/20/135841.aspx">
The destructor is running at the wrong time</a>.
</p>
<p>
I leave it as an exercise to fix the destructor timing problem.
To see whether you got it right, run the <code>fakedrop</code>
command line again.
When you successfully get an email message, then you know you've got it.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily call COM bloat, but there&#8217;s no doubt it&#8217;s terribly complex. &nbsp;Most of the COM-oriented articles that Raymond writes highlight that complexity and should make most programmers want to hide in fear. &nbsp;Of course there&#8217;s not much reason for Raymond to write about the simple COM stuff, but it&#8217;s still an understatement to say that COM requires an awful lot of knowledge to use correctly.</p>

<p>if (FAILED(CoInitialize(NULL)) { goto Exit; }</p>

		<p>Yeah, this is what happens when you mix resource lifetime management patterns.</p>
<p>The correct way would be to create some CCoInitialize class, something like:</p>
<p>class CCoInitialize</p>
<p>{</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;CCoInitialize() &nbsp; &nbsp;{ &nbsp;m_hr = CoInitialize(NULL); &nbsp;}</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;~CCoInitialize()</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;{</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if (SUCCEEDED(m_hr))</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CoUnInitialize();</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;}</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;HRESULT m_hr;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>And then you would have a nice main:</p>
<p>int __cdecl wmain(int argc, WCHAR **argv)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p> CCoInitialize coinit;</p>
<p> ProcessReference ref;</p>
<p> &#8230;.</p>
<p>}</p>

		<p>Friday: &quot;COM, RPC and OLE (i don&#8217;t know what are never equivalents) should be burned and burried. That is the bloat of Windows.</p>
<p>If you need one program to work with another&#8217;s data, use save file / export/import.&quot;</p>
<p>This is totally stupid. &nbsp;You don&#8217;t understand what COM is designed for, or what it can do.</p>
<p>I have some programs written in Visual Basic .NET 2005 that make COM calls to the object model of a popular contact management system. &nbsp;These programs update certain values within certain contact records, based on client account values that are read from another source.</p>
<p>There is NO WAY that you could do the equivalent thing using file export/import. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, maybe, you could get everyone else to stop using the program to prevent data being changed while the following is happening &#8212; not likely &#8212; and then export ALL of the client contact records to a file. &nbsp;(The export would be done manually, from the user interface &#8212; if there&#8217;s no COM). &nbsp;Then, call a separate program to merge the file data from one program with the client account values, then delete ALL of the client records (from the user interface of the contact manager program), then re-import ALL of them (from the user interface).</p>
<p>How, exactly, is this better? &nbsp;It&#8217;s NOT.</p>
<p>I also have several programs that use the Excel and Outlook object models for verious reasons. &nbsp;One of the programs is designed to load some spreadsheet data (that is in a complicated, not-easy-to-directly-import format) into a SQL database. &nbsp;The program calls Excel&#8217;s object model to open many different spreadsheet files, and read selected data from most of the worksheets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have another program that calls the COM object model of an FTP program, to see what files are available to download at one FTP site, and then download the new files (whose file names don&#8217;t appear in a SQL table).</p>
<p>All of those object models are part of COM, which includes the ability to call those METHODS and change things in real time. &nbsp;The beauty of COM is that the program designers (for the contact management system, the FTP program, and even Excel) can build the COM methods and properties without knowing what all uses those methods will be used for in the future. &nbsp;It&#8217;s called an INTERFACE.</p>
<p>Exporting and importing data is not the answer. &nbsp;I&#8217;m afraid that you don&#8217;t understand.</p>

		<p>So this begs a longstanding question: &nbsp;How does one go about getting an IDropTarget for an hwnd that has an IDropTarget registered for it via RegisterDragDrop?</p>
<p>DoDragDrop apparently has access to a table of marshalled interface pointers, and this table is exposed in some way that it can be accessed from different processes. &nbsp;Is there a magic registered COM object that allows this access?</p>
<p>And is there some way for non-Shell apps to access this table?</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, there is a window property that (at least in win32) holds an interface pointer to IDropTarget &#8211; but it&#8217;s undocumented, and the interface pointer is for the hwnd&#8217;s process space (and apartment). &nbsp;And we never use undocumented features :-)</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there is no way to get a marshaled pointer from a different process (without the other process providing the marshaling information) &#8211; so how does DoDragDrop actually get the IDropTarget? &nbsp;</p>
<div class="post">[<i>The question may be longstanding, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/11/24/269237.aspx" rel="nofollow">but so too is the answer</a>. Raymond</i>]</div>

It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
