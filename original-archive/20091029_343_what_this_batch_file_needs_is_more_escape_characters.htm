(Employing the snowclone "What this X needs is more Y.")
</p>
<p>
Each time you add a parsing pass to the batch processor,
you have to
<a HREF="http://alcor.concordia.ca/~smw/home/telnet_song.html">
add another layer of escaping</a>.
This is just a special case of the more general rule of thumb:
<a HREF="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ButlerLampson">
any problem in quoting can be solved by adding another layer of escaping</a>.
</p>
<p>
(Okay, it's not actually true, nor is it a rule of thumb,
but it's still something to keep in mind.)
</p>
<p>
When you enable delayed variable expansion, you add another parsing
pass to the batch processor.
It used to expand % variables at the time the line is ready,
but now you told it that, oh wait, just before executing the
command, expand it a second time (this time looking for ! variables.)
</p>
<p>Which means that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/06/8835317.aspx#8838178">
if you want to echo an exclamation point</a>,
you have to protect the exclamation point so the parser won't treat
it as a delayed expansion.
</p>
<pre>
echo Error^^!
</pre>
<p>
The <code>^^</code> collapses to a <code>^</code> during the first
parsing pass.
On the second parsing pass, the <code>^!</code> turns into a <code>!</code>
</p>
<p>
Remember,
the batch language was not designed; it evolved.
I admire
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/06/8835317.aspx#8839065">
the approach taken by commenter Nick</a>,
in a tip of the hat to Douglas Adams:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
Much like the universe,
if anyone ever <i>does</i> fully come to understand Batch
then the language will instantly be replaced by an
infinitely weirder and more complex version of itself.
This has obviously happened at least once before ;)

		<p>Powershell is available as a download for XP SP2 and up. &nbsp;Heck, I think it shows up in Windows Update (as an optional update) for some of them. &nbsp;What more do you want? &nbsp;If MS marked it as a critical update to get full deployment, people would complain that MS was &quot;taking over their machines&quot; or otherwise imposing itself on them.</p>

		<p>The problem with Powershell is that now you have to install Powershell. And before you can install Powershell, you have to install the .Net framework. That means you can&#8217;t ship a simple Powershell script with your app unless you want the user to possibly have to download hundreds of MB of almost-unnecessary utilities. It also means that you can&#8217;t do casual scripting on arbitrary (i.e. other people&#8217;s) computers with it.</p>
<p>I frequently remote into other people&#8217;s computers to do work, but I&#8217;ve never seen one that had Powershell installed, so I am stuck doing all my scripting in batch files.</p>

		<p>Anyone who wants to do serious, principled, and robust batch file scripting should keep Tim Hill&#8217;s &quot;Windows NT Shell Scripting&quot; close at hand, although (as the title implies) it doesn&#8217;t cover newer features like delayed variable expansion. &nbsp;I occasionally have to write complex batch files for colleagues and have found the book indispensible &#8212; what&#8217;s more, it actually gives me a twisted appreciation for the language. &nbsp;Like watching a dancing bear, the joy of writing .bat scripts comes from the mind-boggling fact that you&#8217;ve made it perform at all.</p>

		<p>What&#8217;s wrong with using VBScript? &nbsp;It is essentially universally available on Windows, and much easier to write (and read, for that matter) than batch files.</p>

		<p>I love how Raymond&#8217;s blog is a kind of time capsule. &nbsp;You can post something a year ago, or two or three years ago, and then long after it&#8217;s been completely forgotten, bam! there it is again :)</p>
<p>John:</p>
<p>I agree. &nbsp;I regularly find myself drawn towards Windows Scripting Host (whether via VBScript or JScript) when I need to automate or script some function in Windows that isn&#8217;t mind-numbingly trivial to do in Batch. &nbsp;When combined with WMI and other COM objects (especially ADSI and IE), it is surprisingly powerful and capable. I&#8217;ve got a &quot;Scripts&quot; folder on my work machine with about 30 somewhat complex scripts (i.e., more than 40 or so lines) I&#8217;ve written and anticipate using again.</p>
<p>I keep meaning to look into PowerShell more as it&#8217;s becoming more and more ubiquitous on Windows &#8212; Win7, and Server 2008 both have it by default. &nbsp;The .NET framework is getting hard to find not installed on computers as more and more software is written with it, and having direct access to that whole framework from a script is pretty awesome. Overall PS will be a good thing to have.</p>

		<p>Indeed. VBScript is the tool of choice for any desktop management function in any reasonably large environment I&#8217;ve been in. Everyone who performs these functions talks about PowerShell, ranging from wanting to learn it to they are actively doing things with it on a small scale, but it&#8217;s not the method used for enterprise deployments yet.</p>
<p>Give it a few years- it&#8217;s an excellent tool, but too few machines can run it, and it&#8217;s difficult to justify the business case for deploying PowerShell to the Enterprise.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
