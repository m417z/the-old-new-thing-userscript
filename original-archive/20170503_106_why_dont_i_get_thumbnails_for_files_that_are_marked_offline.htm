<p>
A customer deployed
a data archival system that migrates files to network-attached storage
after a period of inactivity.
The customer reported that when a file is archived,
they are no longer able to see thumbnails in Explorer.
The customer contacted the vendor of the archival system,
and the vendor explained that the archival system's
default configuration sets the
<code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_OFFLINE</code> attribute when
a file is archived.
And Explorer doesn't show thumbnails for offline files.
</p>
<p>
The customer wanted to know whether this was by design.
</p>
<p>
Yes, this is by design.
Explorer assumes that files that are marked offline
must not be accessed casually,
because any attempt to access an offline file
will cause it to be recalled from archival storage and
brought online.
And you can't generate a thumbnail for a file without
accessing the file.
</p>
<p>
If Explorer were to read a file in order to generate a thumbnail,
that would mean that opening a folder would recall
every file!
</p>
<p>
The customer is faced with a choice,
</p>
<p>
If you set the offline attribute when a file is archived,
then Explorer will not recall the file until you take
an explicit action on the file, like double-clicking it.
This means that Explorer will not read the file in order to generate
a thumbnail or a customized icon or a preview,
nor will it read the file in order to extract other properties.
(And it expects all shell extensions to respect the offline
attribute and follow the same policy.)
This is good for your archival system because it means that
archived files stay archived until somebody actually wants it,
but it means that you lose out on some features because those
features would trigger a recall.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if you do not set the offline attribute
when a file is archived,
then Explorer will access the file in order to generate
thumbnails and customized icons and previews,
and it will read the file in order to extract other properties.
This gives you all the features of normal files,
but it has a good chance of
negating the work your archival system performed
because it will trigger a file recall.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if the archival storage system
offers fast retrieval of file contents
(possibly with a policy of not actually recalling
the file until some other signals are received),
then maybe omitting the offline attribute is the
right thing.
</p>
<p>
You'll want to try it both ways and see which you like better.
But at least you now understand the tradeoffs.</p>

		<p>Actually opening (hence retrieving) the file to *generate* a thumbnail would be a bad thing, certainly (which is pretty much the whole point of the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_OFFLINE attribute, after all) &#8211; but what about using a cached thumbail previously generated? Does Explorer ignore or expire those when it sees a file has been migrated, or does setting FILE_ATTRIBUTE_OFFLINE invalidate the cached thumbnail for some reason?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d bet that Explorer doesn&#8217;t use the thumbnail cache for offline files because the guiding principle of &#8220;offline&#8221; is &#8220;don&#8217;t touch the file except for an explicit request from the user&#8221;.  Imagine if it did check the thumbs.db for a thumbnail for an offline file, found nothing, and then decided to generate one?  Simply not loading any thumbnails for offline files is the safest thing to do.</p>

		<p>So&#8230; no caching is done using the Thumbs database? This is one good use case for that&#8230; if the file is offline but you have a thumb in thumbs.db, use it (and maybe overlay an icon showing the offline status)&#8230;</p>

		<p>It can&#8217;t help that since those flags were named the meaning of those terms have reversed in some contexts.  Now, if someone says that certain files are offline and others are online, I would expect the former to be on some local fast media, and the latter to require fetching from some kind of intranet/internet/cloud service.</p>

		<p>Long ago, software help files were often labeled &#8220;on-line help&#8221;, and I found it odd, because it was clearly off-line as one didn&#8217;t need to dial up to the internet to get it. They were obviously trying to contrast it with printed manuals (which I suppose are another type of &#8220;off-line&#8221;), but it is interesting how fast people&#8217;s expectations can change, and how terminology sometimes takes a while to catch up and can even reverse meanings like that.</p>

		<p>And these days on-line help is probably online again.  Of course, I&#8217;m old enough to remember when &#8220;wireless&#8221; was an slightly outmoded term for a valve / transistor radio receiver.</p>

		<p>You mentioning how &#8220;wireless&#8221; has changed meanings somehow reminded me of this, though I&#8217;m not sure why. Maybe how &#8220;Wi-fi&#8221; means &#8220;internet access&#8221; now instead of a new-fangled way of wirelessly accessing a network:<br />

		<p>This is exactly why &#8220;hide extensions for known filetypes&#8221; is wrong to be set as default.  Two files named &#8230; for example&#8230; &#8220;readme&#8221;, where one is an exe and one is a txt file, can&#8217;t be distinguished if the icon is supposed to be the distinguishing element, and if the icons aren&#8217;t shown when the files are offline.</p>

		<p>Some while ago, the icons were fetched from a local DLL based exclusively on the .three-letter well-known extension. I cannot think of an excuse not to apply this policy to _OFFLINE files</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
