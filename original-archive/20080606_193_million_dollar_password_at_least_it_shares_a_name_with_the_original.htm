<p><i>Password</i> was one of the classic game shows. Its methodical pace encouraged thoughtful play, as opposed to today's game shows which appear to rely on dramatic music and ominous spotlights for their appeal.</p>
<p> This is <a href="http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/05/29/the-odd-couple-password-video/"> not a clip from the game show</a> but rather a scene from the comedy <i>The Odd Couple</i> in which the two characters are contestants, and as you might expect from a sitcom, they fail spectacularly. But even from the clip, you can get a pretty good feel for how the game is played. </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/million_dollar_password/"> The new version is nothing like it</a>. It's really "try to guess a word which your partner describes in three words." </p>
<p> The strategy of deciding whether to "pass or play": Gone. </p>
<p> Picking up a miss from the opponent: Gone. </p>
<p> It sounds like <a href="http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/preview-of-million-dollar-password/"> the folks at BuzzerBlog aren't big fans of the remake either</a>. </p>

		<p>The new one does seem more like &quot;Pyramid&quot; than &quot;Password&quot;.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know if you noticed lately, but with all the kids with ADD and ADHD, the old Password show would last ten seconds before killing its audience. The new one, while different, is just probably more entertaining, IMO.</p>

		<p>Hasn&#8217;t inflation ruined the US dollar enough already that a &quot;million dollar&quot; game show shouldn&#8217;t require rule changes?</p>

		<p>But it has Regis!!~</p>
<p>Seriously though, I agree. &nbsp;Every new gameshow they come up with (I use the word &quot;new&quot; very loosely here) is worse than the previous. &nbsp;The only gameshows I watch are ones that take at least a <em>little</em> skill or knowledge, usually old standbys like Jeopardy or Wheel of Fortune. &nbsp;Random is okay, but not if the entire show is one random event after another.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
