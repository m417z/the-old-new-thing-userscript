		<p>At least it&#8217;s not as bad as looking through a source, that you wrote, but you don&#8217;t understand what the hell you coded, or how you came up with that angle in the first place, and end up feeling like you need to rewrite it all, because you doubt your own code&#8230;</p>

		<p>&#8230;but is it not woderful if you got the task to extend some module (add a function point), and then to discover a comment on how to add it.</p>
<p>(When checking who wrote that comment then I discovered that it was my earlier self from two years ago.)</p>
<p>* Some tasks are only held in a more or less big cache &#8212; if this is flushed you have to regain context.</p>
<p>* Commenting code helps not only other people to maintain it, but also yourself.</p>

		<p>Ah, that&#8217;s my thought about code readability: after leaving some code for a while, not able to remember every detail means that I&#8217;d like the code to be understandable, so I wish the code to have good design documentation and enough comments, though sometimes this isn&#8217;t the fact :)</p>

		<p>My least favorite? &nbsp;Looking at code I&#8217;ve written years ago and wondering &quot;was I on drugs when I wrote that? &nbsp;It&#8217;s an order of magnitude more complicated than it ought to be.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I simplify it and&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>I spend hours debugging code that ought to work, damn it. After about 6 hours of tedious and ever more mind-numbing debugging, I find the problem.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bloody compiler bug/library ambiguity (thank you Java)/OS bug. &nbsp;Suddenly my memory clicks. &nbsp;I remember being outraged that my beautiful clean code was going to require an enormously clunky work-around.</p>
<p>Of course, a lesson like that made me remember to do lots of &quot;this might look stupid, but I wrote it this way because&#8230;&quot; type comments for myself, but I&#8217;d been programming for enough years at that point that I had 4 or 5 years worth of these little gems to find over the next 20.</p>

		<p>Hehe&#8230; yeah&#8230; I&#8217;ve been there and done that too. Several times I&#8217;ve been looking for solutions to some random problem, and hey presto, there&#8217;s me on a newsgroup telling someone else what the solution to that random problem is.</p>
<p>I figure it&#8217;s a me from the future, who has finally cracked time travel, and is just screwing with me.</p>

<p>Afraid not, straight out of my fingers, merely with no brain involvement. While I am someone who does sometimes err on the side of copypaste when if I thought about it retyping would be quicker, that wasn&#8217;t one of those times.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
