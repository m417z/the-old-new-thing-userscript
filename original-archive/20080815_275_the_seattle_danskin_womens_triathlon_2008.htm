<p>This Sunday will be the Nth annual Seattle <a href="http://www.danskin.com/triathlon.html"> Danskin Women's Triathlon</a> (for some value of N greater than 1), the largest women-only triathlon. I learned about this event last year when I saw that the express lanes on the I-90 bridge were crowded with bicyclists, and I went online to try to figure out what was going on.</p>
<p> As I clicked around, I found the <a href="http://www.seattledanskintri.info/"> Volunteer Site</a> and was particularly impressed with the <a href="http://www.seattledanskintri.info/Volunteer/Positions.asp#Swim%20Angel"> Swim Angels</a>. (<a href="http://www.danskin.com/angels.html">More details</a>.) These are strong women swimmers whose job it is to accompany the weaker swimmers and provide moral support. </p>
<p> I was chatting with a friend of mine, who noted that one of the first volunteer positions to fill is the "Help the women change out of their wetsuits in the transition area." Go figure. </p>
<p> Best wishes to all of this weekend's participants! </p>

		<p>You know, if this were a men&#8217;s-only triathalon, somebody would be complaining about how women aren&#8217;t allowed to participate. Does anybody ever wonder why nobody complains about the opposite?</p>

		<p>I have occasionally wondered about that. &nbsp;But then, I have seen women competing in male-dominated events &#8212; sometimes well, sometimes not. &nbsp;I can&#8217;t recall a case where I&#8217;ve seen a man competing in a &quot;women&#8217;s&quot; event, though. &nbsp;Not sure whether that&#8217;s due to it not being allowed, or whether they just don&#8217;t want to. &nbsp;Or maybe I just don&#8217;t watch sufficient events to see that sort of thing. &nbsp;Probably a mix of all three.</p>

		<p>The reason no one is complaining is because it&#8217;s not politically correct. &nbsp;I think lots of men would want to do this race if they could. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a triathlon conveniently located right in Seattle, which is hard to come by. &nbsp;It&#8217;s also beginner-friendly, so it would appeal to beginner guys. &nbsp;And, of course, there&#8217;s the excellent male-female ratio to consider.</p>
<p>I think the vibe or goals or something of female-only events are different than regular events, though, and men would just mess it up&#8230;somehow. &nbsp;I have done some races to support women&#8217;s causes, and they have always focused on finishing instead of being competitive. &nbsp;They also treated me like crap on most occasions (&quot;oh, snap, all we have for post-race food is Luna bars, and it clearly says &#8216;nutrition for women&#8217; on the wrapper. &nbsp;I&#8217;m pretty sure you can&#8217;t digest it. &nbsp;No food for you, you horrible MAN!&quot;), but that&#8217;s a separate issue.</p>

		<p>Best part of the race FAQ (<a href="http://www.danskin.com/faqrace.html" target=_new rel=nofollow rel="nofollow">http://www.danskin.com/faqrace.html</a>):</p>
<p>&#8220;WILL I BE LAST TO CROSS THE FINISH LINE?</p>
<p>No. Sally Edwards, the DWTS spokeswoman, is the last to cross the Finish Line at every Race.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If men want a male only event, why don&#8217;t they just create one instead of whining, and put up with the same kind of backlash you&#8217;re dishing out against a women only event. Grow up.</p>

		<p>I think the point is less about wanting a male only event (which no one here, as far as I can see, has expressed a desire for) but more about having events (whatever their focus) open to anyone interested in them.</p>
<p>There are just as many women who could mess up the vibe of a women&#8217;s only event as there are men who could do the same. Gender is not a foolproof predictor of behaviour or attitude.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
