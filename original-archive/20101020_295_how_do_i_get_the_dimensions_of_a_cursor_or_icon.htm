<p>
Given a <code>HICON</code> or a <code>HCURSOR</code>,
how do you get the dimensions of the icon or cursor?
</p>
<p>
The <code>GetIconInfo</code> function gets you most of the way there,
returning you an <code>ICONINFO</code> structure which gives you
the mask and color bitmaps (and the hotspot, if a cursor).
You can then use the <code>GetObject</code> function to get the
attributes of the bitmap.
And then here's the tricky part:
You have to massage the data a bit.
</p>
<pre>
// Also works for cursors
BOOL GetIconDimensions(<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383701(VS.85).aspx"
>__in</a> HICON hico, __out SIZE *psiz)
{
  ICONINFO ii;
  BOOL fResult = GetIconInfo(hico, &amp;ii);
  if (fResult) {
    BITMAP bm;
    fResult = GetObject(ii.hbmMask, sizeof(bm), &amp;bm) == sizeof(bm);
    if (fResult) {
      psiz-&gt;cx = bm.bmWidth;
      psiz-&gt;cy = ii.hbmColor ? bm.bmHeight : bm.bmHeight / 2;
    }
    if (ii.hbmMask)  DeleteObject(ii.hbmMask);
    if (ii.hbmColor) DeleteObject(ii.hbmColor);
  }
  return fResult;
}
</pre>
<p>
As we've learned over the past few days,
an icon consists of two bitmaps, a <i>mask</i> and an <i>image</i>.
A cursor is the same as an icon, but with a hotspot.
</p>
<p>
To get the dimensions of the icon or cursor, just take the dimensions
of the color bitmap.
If you have one.
</p>
<p>
If the icon/cursor is monochrome, then there is no color bitmap.
As we've learned, in that case, the mask and image bitmaps are combined
into a single double-height bitmap,
and the color is reported as <code>NULL</code>.
To get the size of the image, you therefore have to
take the mask bitmap and divide its height by two.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s just a restriction of that specific function. &nbsp;Some other functions might also make the same assumption, but there are icons out there with non-square dimensions, and at least in some situations they work. I distinctly remember that CGA mode on Windows 3.0 used 32&#215;16 icons (CGA full colour mode resolution is something like 320&#215;120, so pixels are a long way from square). &nbsp;But I installed a shell replacement that didn&#39;t understand the idea of non-square icons, and just displayed half of each, so the problem has been around at least that long.</p>

		<p>I know that this week mostly concerns icons (and the PNG icons haven&#39;t been covered yet), but the layout of the .ani format might be intersting is as well. (My guess would be that it might just be an icon with multiple icons in the same file, a hostsport / hotspot per frame and possibly some animation parameters such as delay between frames)</p>
<p>(If it is a multiple icon icon file, it would also be interesting to see what happens if someone messes it up &#8211; by adding icons of different size and color depths and formats&#8230;)</p>

		<p>Speaking of IExtractIcon and icon sizes &#8211; IExtractIcon::Extract lets you specify the size, however it most often returns S_FALSE, which means &quot;don&#39;t bother me, call ExtractIcon&quot;. But ExtractIcon (and ExtractIconEx) doesn&#39;t have a size parameter! How do I get an icon of arbitrary size from IExtractIcon?</p>

		<p>It&#39;s always seemed ridiculously inefficient to me to have to call a function that creates two bitmaps, just to get the dimensions that would already be known internally anyway. Couldn&#39;t a GetIconSize() function have been added at some point?</p>

		<p>It *is* possible to create icons where width != height. I remember an old version of the ImagEdit allowed to create 32&#215;16 monochrome icons.</p>

		<p>I found icons with width!=height extremely useful, because using icon was the only way to embed 32-bit (that is, with 8-bit alpha channel) image resource. Paint.NET has a wonderful plugin that allows to save an .ico file with arbitrary collection of images.</p>

		<p>@alexcohn &#8211; I am using 32-bit bitmap resources just fine. Are you sure they don&#39;t work for you? I am using Visual Studio 2008 and my code runs on Vista+, so maybe on older compiler or OS there are problems.</p>

		<p>I know this is WAY off topic (and a bit late), but anyway:</p>
<p>The &quot;Header Annotations&quot; documentation you link to above says the following:</p>
<p>__nullnullterminated : The buffer may be accessed up to and including the first sequence of two null characters or pointers.</p>
<p>But as you have blogged about a single   is a valid (empty) double-null-terminated strings. Does this mean that:</p>
<p>a) That annotation must not be used for double-null-terminated strings or</p>
<p>b) it is valid for double-null-terminated strings but the documentation is not quite correct in this regard?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
