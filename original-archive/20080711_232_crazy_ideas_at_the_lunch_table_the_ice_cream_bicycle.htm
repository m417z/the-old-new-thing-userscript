<p>At the lunch table some time ago, we considered the possibility of riding the <a href="http://www.cascade.org/EandR/stp/"> STP</a> atop a classic <a href="http://www.industrialbicycles.com/v-ict.htm"> ice cream bicycle</a>. You could <a href="http://musicthing.blogspot.com/2005/04/why-do-ice-cream-vans-sound-way-they.html"> play the music</a> and cruise down the road, selling ice cream sandwiches out of your trunk.</p>
<p> Naturally, you'd start really early in the day, because you can't go very fast on that bicycle, and besides, nobody is going to want ice cream early in the morning, so you may as well get a head start on them. Ideally, they would catch up to you around mid-afternoon, during the hot part of the day when they're looking for a break. </p>
<p> No idea how practical this is, it was just a crazy idea. </p>
<p> (Apparently we're <a href="http://zachdms.livejournal.com/107185.html"> not the first people</a> to come up with this crazy idea.) </p>
<p> The STP takes place this weekend. I wish all the riders a safe and enjoyable journey. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus shout-out</b>: Among those riders is one of my lunchmates. <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/370401_stp11.html"> Read his story here</a>. </p>

		<p>&quot;selling ice cream sandwiches out of your trunk&quot;</p>
<p>Ok, so now we&#8217;ve got this elephant, riding a bicycle made out of ice cream, selling ice cream out of his trunk&#8230;</p>
<p>No. Wait. That was just a halluciniogenic flashback.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s how I read &quot;ice cream bicycle&quot; as well. &quot;What madness is this, it&#8217;d melt,&quot; I thought, before reading further.</p>

		<p>Not strictly the same thing as your ice cream bicycle, but a couple of years back, my cycling friend had an idea for an ice cream themed bike century &#8212; 100 miles on bike while eating ice cream along the way. We survived it.</p>

		<p>This needs a custom bike. Tandem, with the second rider facing backwards, towards the cooler, able to hand out ice cream in flight to hungry riders.</p>

		<p>Joe&#8217;s right. If you have to stop to sell the ice cream, you&#8217;ll likely end up last.</p>
<p>On the other hand, unless they have a third arm or are extremely talented, I can&#8217;t see any other riders being able to eat their ice cream on the wing&#8230;</p>

		<p>That is why, contrary to what your parents might have told you, it is an <em>essential</em> skill to be able to ride a bike without using your hands.</p>

		<p>And if you prefer running in disguise, you may want to try the Marathon du M&#233;doc, and taste many wines along the way :)</p>

<p>I thought there was a bike version but couldn&#8217;t find any reference&#8230;</p>

		<p>This would be a huge hit at the annual Hottest Day of the Year Ride in Portland. They have ice cream available at the finish line, but who could resist even more ice cream enroute?</p>
<p>For the annual Worst Day of the Year Ride in February, maybe you could hand out coffee instead&#8230;</p>

		<p>This also needs to be extended to the &#8216;bay in a day&#8217; ride in Melbourne! &nbsp;Any takers? :-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
