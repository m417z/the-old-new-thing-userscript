The DC brush</a>
<code>GetStockObject(DC_BRUSH)</code>
is a stock brush associated with the device context.
Like
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/brushes_1mlk.asp">
the system color brushes</a>,
the color of the DC brush changes dynamically,
but whereas the system color brushes change color based
on the system colors, the color of the DC brush changes at your command.
</p>
<p>
The DC brush is handy when you need a solid color brush for
a very short time, since it always exists and doesn't need to be
created or destroyed.  Normally, you have to create a solid color brush,
draw with it, then destroy it.  With the DC brush, you set its color and
start drawing.
But it works only for a short time, because the moment somebody else
calls
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/devcons_0gj6.asp">
the <code>SetDCBrushColor</code> function</a>
on your DC, the DC brush color will be overwritten.
In practice, this means that the DC brush color is not trustworthy
once you relinquish control to other code.
(Note, however, that each DC has its own DC brush color,
so you need only worry about somebody on another thread messing with
your DC simultaneously, which doesn't happen under any of the painting models
I am familiar with.)
</p>
<p>
The DC brush is amazingly useful when handling
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/devnotes/winprog/wm_ctlcolor_.asp">
the various WM_CTLCOLOR messages</a>.
These messages require you to return a brush that will be used
to draw the control background.
If you need a solid color brush, this usually means creating the
solid color brush and caching it for the lifetime of the window,
then destroying it when the window is destroyed.
(<a HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=388C1662.71CE6F75@sirma.bg">Some people cache the brush in a static variable</a>, which works great
until somebody creates two copies of the dialog/window.
Then you get a big mess.)
</p>
<p>
Let's use the DC brush to customize the colors of a static control.
The program is not interesting as a program; it's just an illustration
of one way you can use the DC brush.
</p>
<p>
Start, as always, with our
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
scratch program</a>, and making the following changes.
</p>
<pre>
BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
  <font COLOR=blue>g_hwndChild = CreateWindow(TEXT("static"), NULL,
        WS_VISIBLE | WS_CHILD, 0, 0, 0, 0,
        hwnd, NULL, g_hinst, 0);
 if (!g_hwndChild) return FALSE;</font>
 return TRUE;
}

<font COLOR=blue>HBRUSH OnCtlColor(HWND hwnd, HDC hdc, HWND hwndChild, int type)
{
  FORWARD_WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC(hwnd, hdc, hwndChild, DefWindowProc);
  SetDCBrushColor(hdc, RGB(255,0,0));
  return GetStockBrush(DC_BRUSH);
}

    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC, OnCtlColor);</font>
</pre>
<p>
Run this program and observe that we changed the background color
of the static window to red.
</p>
<p>
The work happens inside the <code>OnCtlColor</code> function.
When asked to customize the colors, we first forward the message
to
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/windowprocedures/windowprocedurereference/windowprocedurefunctions/defwindowproc.asp">
the <code>DefWindowProc</code> function</a>
so that the default foreground and background text colors are set.
(Not relevant here since we draw no text, but a good thing to do
on principle.)
Since we want to override the background brush color,
we set the DC brush color to red and then return the DC brush
as our desired background brush.
</p>
<p>
The static control then takes the brush we returned (the DC brush)
and uses it to draw the background, which draws in red because
that's the color we set it to.
</p>
<p>
Normally, when customizing the background brush, we have to create
a brush, return it from the WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC message, then destroy
it when the parent window is destroyed.
But by using the DC brush, we avoided having to do all that bookkeeping.
</p>
<p>
There is also a DC pen <code>GetStockObject(DC_PEN)</code> which behaves
in an entirely analogous manner.</p>

		<p>Raymond are you not contradiciting yourself?<br />
<br />&gt; In practice, this means that the DC brush color is not trustworthy once you relinquish control to other code<br />
<br />Well, when your code returns you lost control.<br />
<br />Another words where is the guarantee that control uses your brush right away?</p>

		<p>The trouble is that Windows doesn&#8217;t support the stock DC brush. Only certain specific versions of Windows support it.<br />
<br />In a corporate context that&#8217;s OK because you have some control; but in the wider world you can&#8217;t go excluding people from your market like that, so you have to have code that handles the other versions anyway.</p>

		<p>Universalis: True, if you need to run on Windows 98, then you can&#8217;t use this.</p>
<p>Adrian: GetStockObject(DC_BRUSH) returns the DC brush. The DC brush doesn&#8217;t have a color itself; it takes its color from the DC. That&#8217;s the whole point of the DC brush.</p>

		<p>Raymond&gt; I think the question was how does GetStockBrush(DC_BRUSH) know which DC you mean, since there is no HDC parameter?</p>
<p>Simon Cooke&gt; You bet I&#8217;m still supporting Win 98 and Me. The people who buy my software still use 98, and I sure as hell am not going to give up sales (meaning, lose money) by supporting only 2K+.</p>

		<p>Only about 5% of PC users use Windows XP. Similar proportions for 2000, NT4, and 98.<br />

		<p>&#8230; of course, if you&#8217;re still supporting Windows 98 today, 7 years after it came out, I feel for you, I really do.</p>
<p>Still, at least you&#8217;re not supporting Windows ME, right? *evil grin*</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s magical in a similar way that monochrome DDBs use the BkColor and TextColor of the DC it&#8217;s selected in as their palette as opposed to monochrome DIBs that use a palette stored in the bitmap header. GDI has all sorts of neat tricks like this hidden that not many people seem to know about (another one is that you can get the stock 1&#215;1 monochrome bitmap handle by passing a 0 width or 0 height to certain bitmap creation functions).</p>

		<p>Unfortunately most of people give up 98 &#8211; including Microsoft, Matrox, freeware coders &#8211; no support, no drivers, even no apps anymore. I hate situation when I can&#8217;t use some software because one feature of XP, which could be, rather, easily implemented or just skipped, as unnecessary, under 98 &#8211; either by app&#8217;s coder or Microsoft. I.e. GUI+ and some of statistics functions &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s harder but in my opinion it needs only some exports [at least w/ faked, nearly empty functions] and modifications of blits. I.e. alpha effects could be done by simple, imperfect trick like that one used by Avast!. Then you get uprising compatibility and functionality.<br />
<br />Hmmm&#8230; Maybe it&#8217;s time to get my hands on such things :) .</p>

		<p>Adrian, why would Microsoft want to do the harder work to support Windows 98? They would rather you buy a new OS from them, and this is one way they can subtly apply pressure on you to do it. Obsolescence is not a feature of software, but you can build it in if you have a dominany market position.</p>

		<p>Moi: If you want to continue supporting Windows 98 then more power to you. It means that you can&#8217;t take advantage of features that don&#8217;t exist in Windows 98. Or are you saying Windows should never add any new features?  Should Windows 1.0 have been the last version of Windows?</p>

		<p>This seems like a brittle way to implement WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC.  What if you have a custom control that queries WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC and WM_CTLCOLORDLG while drawing?  Is it true that the standard Windows controls will always use the brush immediately before sending any other CTLCOLOR messages?  (presumably yes)</p>
<p>It seems strange to force the drawing code to remember that the brushes it gets may become invalidated and change colors at odd times.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
