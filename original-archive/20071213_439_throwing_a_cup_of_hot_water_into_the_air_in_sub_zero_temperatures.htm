		<p>I tell this to people all the time but no one believes me and its never cold enough to do down here. I never thought to search youtube for it.</p>
<p>I remember my AP Physics teacher explaining why it works (IIRC it has to be hot water) but I don&#8217;t remember the specific explanation. Any physics people know why?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen this before, and was tempted to try it last year. I think I have to this year. It might only get cold enough during the night though where I am (southern WI), and then only for about a week each year.</p>

<hr />
<p>&quot;Some people claim that hot water freezes faster because a pot of boiling water can be thrown into the air on a cold winter day, and it freezes in mid air creating a shower of ice crystals. Whereas a pot of cold water thrown into the air comes down as large blobs of water. This happens because the hot water is so close to being steam, that the act of throwing it into the air causes it to break up into tiny droplets. (hot water is less viscous than cold water, listen to the sound it makes when you pour it in the sink) The small water droplets have a large surface area which allows for a great deal of evaporation, this removes heat quickly. And finally, the cooled droplets are so small, that they can be easily frozen by the winter air. All of this happens before the water hits the ground. Cold water is thicker and stickier, it doesn&#8217;t break up into such small pieces when thrown into the air, so it comes down in large blobs.&quot;</p>

		<p>On a related note, hot water can sometimes freeze faster than cold water.</p>
<p>Looks like this effect was discovered by a Tanzanian kid:</p>

		<p>I have read that the oilfield workers in Alaska have a very hard time with the cold; your steel wrench can snap into many pieces in the cold (steel gets much more brittle at very cold temperatures). &nbsp;It must be quite dangerous and inconvenient to have a wrench snap in your hands&#8230;</p>

		<p>This is a common entertainment in Antarctica, particularly in the winter. Followed by the 300 (degree) club. Google THAT.</p>

		<p>Why google when Slashdot just posted a story about it yesterday (the 300 degree club)? <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/12/1553250" rel="nofollow">http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/12/1553250</a></p>
<p>Well, it was about doing IT in the Antarctic, but there&#8217;s pictures and an explanation of the 300 degree (Fahrenheit, but for those of us not in the US, around 173 degrees C) club. It&#8217;s safe for work&#8230;</p>
<p>Then again, McMurdo is a US base&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
