<p>Some friends came down to visit from <a href="http://www.vancouver.ca/"> Vancouver</a> to take advantage of the favorable exchange rate, and when the topic of lunch arose, one of them suggested Vietnamese sandwiches.</p>
<p> "What are Vietnamese sandwiches?" I asked. </p>
<p> "Okay, that settles it. We're having Vietnamese sandwiches for lunch," was the response. </p>
<p> We went to the generically-named <a href="http://www.nwsource.com/ae/scr/nws_rev.cfm?id=436"> Seattle Deli</a> and ordered our sandwiches. (I had the chicken.) </p>
<p> For less than three dollars I was rewarded with a wonderful sandwich. Crisp French bread around a collection of vegetables, some spicy, some pickled, some fresh, but all crispy, contrasting with the softness of the promised meat. </p>
<p> It's a fantastic dining experience. Too bad there are no Vietnamese sandwich shops near work. </p>

		<p>With the prolonged occupation of Vietnam by the French, the influence of French food and cooking on the indigenous population was inevitable. &nbsp;It should be no surprise, then, the number of French-style delicatessens that are run by Vietnamese expatriates. &nbsp;They certainly do make good food!</p>

		<p>These are delicious! I had gone out for lunch and on the menu were 2 or 3 lines of Vietnamese writing followed by the single English word &quot;sandwich&quot;.</p>
<p>I asked the waitress what it was and she said it was &quot;like a Canadian sandwich.&quot;</p>
<p>No idea what that meant, but I took a chance and loved it.</p>

		<p>Many Pho (vietnamese noodle bowl) restaurants will serve Banh mi as well. Around Totem Lake is a little place called Pho Express that serves a great sandwich. In the Bellevue-Overlake area, Andre&#8217;s restaurant had great sandwiches in the vietnamese style (but the restaurant itself is a high falutin&#8217; sit down pan-Asian and French restaurant itself so it&#8217;ll cost ya). Try asking when you get Pho sometime.</p>

		<p>As being a Chinese, another Vietnamese food that I really like is their spring roll. They have one that using steamed rice wrapper without fried. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>&quot;Too bad there are no Vietnamese sandwich shops near work.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a Pho Cyclo Cafe in the building 120 cafeteria that serves chicken, pork, or shrimp sandwiches. Quite good &amp; reasonably-priced.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m sure you can get them at the Vietnamese restaurant in the Crossroads Food Court and I&#8217;m pretty sure you can get them at Saigon City close to campus near the Kidd Valley Hamburger place.</p>

		<p>If you like the chicken &quot;banh mi&quot; you&#8217;ll love the &quot;banh mi ba chi&quot; it&#8217;s cured pork, has more flavor. And the condense-milk ice coffee is fantastic too.</p>

		<p>For those of you who want to try something else other than &quot;pho&quot; try &quot;hu tieu&quot; &#8216;also a soup like pho but has different flavor and taste&#8217; &nbsp;or you can try something called &quot;bo kho&quot; which is a beef like stew that you eat by dipping French bread into the stew. Not every Vietnamese restaurant will have &quot;hu tieu&quot; and &quot;bo kho&quot; but you can always ask you might be surprise.</p>

		<p>If you like Thai/Vietnamese iced coffee which is made with condensed milk, you might also like the Brazilian Mocha&#8217;s they make at Kitanda Brazilian Espresso.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one near Microsoft&#8217;s Redmond campus, and one in Kirkland/Totem Lake.</p>

		<p>I spent 27 months in Viet Nam starting in 1968 with the US Army. At one point I ate at a mess hall that had hired Vietnamese chefs and we all ate 4-star cuisine for several months. Then some typical Army field-grade officer put a stop to that (&quot;how can we *trust* them?&quot;) and we went back to basic Army chow. &lt;sigh&gt;. &nbsp;BTW that unit had a higher education level in the enlisted personnel than the officers. &nbsp;Intel wasn&#8217;t all bad. The EM did the actual work and the officers were there to make sure we had room &amp; board and to attend briefings.</p>

		<p>Vietnamese sandwiches don&#8217;t get enough good press (or any press). &nbsp;I like the BBQ Pork myself without the hot peppers. &nbsp;The fresh cilantro is also a nice touch. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t forget to order a Cafe Sua Da. (Vietnamese French-press brewed iced coffee)</p>

		<p>Warning #1: The Spam-filled banh mi are less delicious. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning #2: Vietnamese <em>restaurants</em> often do a poor job with sandwiches, covering the meat with a teriyaki glaze and ruining the flavor completely IMHO.</p>

		<p>Leverett,</p>
<p>How old? Well I began programming computers in 1965 (language was MAD: Michigan Algorithm Decoder). I&#8217;m lucky enough now to be retired and can pursue my own projects full-time.</p>
<p>(MAD to dot NET&#8230; what a difference!)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
