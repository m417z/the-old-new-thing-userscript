A customer was having trouble updating the icon in one of their
shortcuts.
Here's what they shared with us:
</p>
<pre>
    i_shell_link-&gt;SetIconLocation(icon_file.value().c_str(), 0);
</pre>
<p>
"Changing the icon from the shortcut property sheet works,
but it's not working from our code.
Is the shortcut property sheet using a different API from
<code>IShell&shy;Link::<wbr>Set&shy;Icon&shy;Location</code>?
In desperation, we added
</p>
<pre>
    SHChangeNotify(SHCNE_ASSOCCHANGED, SHCNF_IDLIST, NULL, NULL);
</pre>
<p>
but that didn't help.
Did we get the flags to
<coe>SHChange&shy;Notification</code> wrong?"
</p>
<p>
The property sheet does use the
<code>IShell&shy;Link::<wbr>Set&shy;Icon&shy;Location</code>
method to change the shortcut icon.
What the customer forgot was to save their changes!
</p>
<pre>
    i_persist_file-&gt;Save(NULL, TRUE);
</pre>
<p>
where <code>i_<wbr>persist_<wbr>file</code> is the 
<code>IPersist&shy;File</code> that they used to load
the shortcut,
or they can use
<code>Query&shy;Interface</code> to get a new pointer.
</p>
<p>
The <code>SHCNE_<wbr>ASSOC&shy;CHANGED</code>
notification is unnecessary, and in fact it's overkill.
That's like saying,
"I want to change the color of my sofa, so I'm going to
demolish my house,
rebuild it,
and then refurnish it with a new sofa."
</p>
<p>
If you want to send a notification to say,
"Hey, I updated this file, please go refresh any
data you have cached about it," you can do a</p>
<pre>
    SHChangeNotify(SHCNE_UPDATEITEM, SHCNF_PATH, fullpath, NULL);
</pre>

		<p>@Mason Wheeler: Given the wording in the documentation for the function (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762118(v=vs.85).aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/bb762118(v=vs.85).aspx</a>), I&#39;d say it&#39;s SHChangeNotify event (SHCNF is a SHChangeNotify flag.)</p>

		<p>I have observed that SHCNE_ASSOCCHANGED will sometimes refresh things not really related to file associations. For example, it seems to update shortcut icons pinned to the taskbar (*1). It is no wonder people might have had some success with it in certain scenarios and use it as a last resort to try to fix icon cache issues.</p>
<p>*1: I guess this could be explained by .lnk files having a icon handler shell extension that makes those icons in the shell imagelist per-instance and receiving this event refreshes the imagelist?</p>

		<p>@Sarkie: Not really. The issue was that the changes made to the shortcut only exist in memory until you call the Save method.</p>
<p>The shell imagelist is cached in that file and can become outdated or have other issues but it is not tied directly to shortcut icons, you can for example ask SHGetFileInfo to give you a HICON or query IShellLink for the icon location and manually extract bypassing the shell imagelist. Explorer and Open/Save dialogs use the shell imagelist (implementation detail) and will sometimes fail to display the correct icon.</p>

		<p>Right click a shortcut on Quick Launch, Properties, change its icon, click OK/Apply. Gets updated instantly. But Shift+right click a pinned taskbar shortcut, Properties, change its icon, click OK/Apply. Icon doesn&#39;t change. After using a third party tool I found that probably sends a SHCNE, all pinned taskbar icons are refreshed/updated instantly. Why is this?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
