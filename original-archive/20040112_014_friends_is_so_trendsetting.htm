<blockquote class="q"><p>  [People with way too much time on their hands]  spent a year going through transcripts  from each episode of the first eight seasons of <i>Friends</i>,  taking note of every single adjective...    <nobr>[T]he</nobr> show's popularity peaked  at the same time the characters said "so" the most,  and as the use of the word declined, so did the show's popularity.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>  So that's how to rescue the show: Make people say "so" more.  </p>
<p>  So if I use the word "so" more, maybe that'll increase my  popularity.  Yes, it's so shallow of me, but so what?  </p>
<p>  Grammar nitpick: "so" in the phrase "so cool" is an adverb,  not an adjective.  </p>
<p>  Raymond's brush with fame: I actually know  one of the writers on "Friends".  </p>

		<p>So&#8230;where do you stand on the question of whether &quot;so&quot; is the official &quot;um&quot; (verbal punctuation or thought placeholder) at Microsoft? I&#8217;ve often noted that most Microsoft speakers use &quot;so&quot; to give them time to form their thoughts when answering questions, and having been through the Wagg-Ed executive training (through INETA), I suspect I know why.</p>
<p>But I wonder&#8230;is it as apparent from within as from without?</p>

		<p>In what situation, for example, would &quot;so&quot; ever be an adjective?</p>

<p>&quot;That&#8217;s so 90&#8217;s.&quot; &#8211; Actually spoken to a friend of mine when he tried to order Creme Brulee.</p>

		<p>Actually, in that case, &quot;so&quot; is still an adverb, modifying the adjective &quot;90&#8217;s&quot;.</p>
<p>Adjectival use is relegated mostly to set phrases nowadays. &quot;Do it just so&quot; (&quot;do it the way I am showing you&quot;) or &quot;That is not so&quot; (&quot;that is not true&quot;).</p>

		<p>Yes, &quot;so&quot; is very visible when you first get to Microsoft. I commented on this on Raymond&#8217;s earlier entry on words to ban.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s strange the people in MS don&#8217;t seem to notice all the &quot;So&quot;ing so much. I&#8217;ve started watching lots of MS videos since the PDC from .Net Show archives to MSDNTV and presentations. Just about everybody interviewed starts every other sentence with the word &quot;SO&quot;.</p>
<p>I guess after a couple of months working in the MS community you don&#8217;t notice this much any more. I expect you start using it yourself without even realising it. But coming from the outside it really does seem strange.</p>
<p>I guess MS is so big you could come up with a dielect all of your own.<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
