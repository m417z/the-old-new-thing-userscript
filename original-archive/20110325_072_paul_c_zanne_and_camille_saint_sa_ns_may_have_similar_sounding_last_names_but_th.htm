<p>Next week, the Seattle Symphony Orchestra performs the <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/symphony/buy/single/production.aspx?id=9045"> Saint-Sa&euml;ns Organ Symphony</a>, but the people responsible for the symphony's radio advertisements don't realize that.</p>
<p> As the strains of the symphony resound in the background, the announcer proudly announces that tickets are still available for "C&eacute;zanne's Organ Symphony." </p>
<p> The names <i>C&eacute;zanne</i> and <i>Saint-Sa&euml;ns</i> may sound similar, but I can assure you that they are not the same person. Here's a handy chart: </p>

<p> This is not the first time the Seattle Symphony's radio announcer has made this substitution. I don't know whether somebody is giving him incorrect copy to read, or whether he is performing on-the-fly auto-correction. Or maybe the announcer guy asked, "How do you pronounce <i>Saint-Sa&euml;ns</i>?" and somebody answered, "It sounds like <i>C&eacute;zanne</i>." </p>
<p> And now that I cleared everything up, let me confuse things some more: </p>

		<p>| Paul C&eacute;zanne and Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns may have similar-sounding last names</p>
<p>No they don&#39;t. (I&#39;m french).</p>
<p>Or more accurately, it would never have occured to me. This is fascinating, how our mother tongue define how we hear sounds.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>To a native English speaker with no knowledge of French, they both begin with an &quot;s&quot; sound, followed by an unaccented vowel (which in English tend to blur together), followed by an s-like sound, then an &quot;ah&quot;, then an &quot;n&quot;. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>&#8230;and they both sound like &quot;synesthesia&quot; which also explains why visual art and orchestral music are basically the same thing. QED</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
