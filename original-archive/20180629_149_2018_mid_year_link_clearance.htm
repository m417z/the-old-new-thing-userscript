<li>Bryan Gaw had been a member of Katy Perry's dance team for five years
    when he performed at the 2015 Super Bowl,
    a dancer's dream come true.
    During the show, he changed out of a metallic horse costume into
    a shark costume.

		<p>Re: Great Bug Hunt</p>
<p>It reminds me of a bug one of my colleagues once tracked down.  They&#8217;d deployed a new production control system to a steel rolling mill.  It worked fine the first day.  The next day, a glitch signaled a problem that caused a problem in the late afternoon.  The next day, the same glitch occurred, but a few minutes later.  Each day, for four days in a row, the same glitch would occur, and each time, the glitch was a few minutes later than the previous day.  On the fifth day, there was a thunderstorm, and no glitch.  The next day, it returned.  By this point, they could predict when it would occur, so they had people throughout the process watching to see what was happening the next day.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when they realized the setting sun was shining through a window and striking an optical sensor, confusing it into an error condition that signaled a safety shutdown.</p>

		<p>Personally, I love status bars, and in my applications, I make sure that every control and menu item has a very helpful (and possibly somewhat long) text displayed in it.</p>
<p>After all, in &#8220;some&#8221; applications, it is very difficult to make every control self-explanatory for all users, and then these short hints can be extremely valuable.</p>
<p>But I know many people don&#8217;t instinctively look at the status bar. Therefore I inform them about it. In one of my applications, I even display a message box on the application&#8217;s first execution informing the user about the very important status bar. I also highlight it very early on in my software&#8217;s documentation and training materials.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
