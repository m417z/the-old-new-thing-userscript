One of my friends is a woman of color,
and not that long ago,
she arrived with three male colleagues in the lobby of a building
for a scheduled meeting.
The administrative assistant came out,
walked right past my friend,
shook the hands of the three men,
and welcomed them.
My friend extended her hand to introduce herself,
and the assistant asked, "Oh, you're with them?"
</p>
<p>
My friend is head of the department.
</p>
<p>
In the aftermath of the incident,
there was an apology,
but along with the apology came a number of excuses:
The remarks were unintentional.
There was no malice intended.
Even the apology itself was a
"I'm sorry you felt this way"
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070226-01/?p=27853">
non-apology</a>.

<p>
Episodes like these are the sort of slights
that accumulate over a career,
and they contribute to an unwelcoming climate for women in the workplace.

Almost all of them said that they enjoyed the work itself.
It was the work environment that drove them out.

		<p>Yale&#8217;s study matches my personal experience. I think it is because people that think of themselves as &#8220;objective&#8221; hardly challenge their assumptions, which are converted into biases. On the other hand, people that doubt of their own objectivity are continuously challenging their thoughts, and that makes them more open minded.</p>

		<p>That plus Dunning-Kruger, which is the more general principle that &#8220;people who think they are good at X are actually bad at X and vice-versa.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Dunning-Kruger study points out that people pretty evenly fall into &#8220;think they&#8217;re good and are actually good, think they&#8217;re good but are actually rubbish, those who think they&#8217;re rubbish but are actually quite good, and those who know all too well that they&#8217;re complete pants at it all.&#8221; There&#8217;s no predictions to it at all, just a simple description that SOME people carry wrong beliefs about their capabilities. Somehow over the years that morphed into &#8220;anyone who thinks they&#8217;re good at something is actually rubbish&#8221; as a way of dismissing all competing claims.</p>
<p>Annoys me to see the study misinterpreted so badly. Most of the time, the Dunning-Kruger Effect is the wrong thing to bring up to make whatever point you&#8217;re trying to make.</p>

		<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>IMO any line of &#8220;reasoning&#8221; in which the act of claiming X&#8211;particularly about oneself&#8211;can be used as proof that X is false should be looked upon with the utmost suspicion by any reasonable being.</p>

		<p>Having read the original paper, I&#8217;m not sure how you&#8217;re using their results here; they came out with three results in toto:</p>
<p> 1. In a randomly selected population, there is no correlation between an individual&#8217;s belief in their abilities and their actual competence.<br />
 2. Getting a randomly selected group of people to mechanically grade tests (compare answers to an answer key) doesn&#8217;t improve the correlation between their belief and their actual competence, even when the grading exercise should show them that their belief is wrong.<br />
 3. Working to improve people&#8217;s actual skill level does improve the correlation between their belief in their abilities and their actual competence, even if their skill level does not increase.</p>
<p>None of those translate for me into &#8220;people who think they are good at X are actually bad at X and vice-versa&#8221;; the first two say that people&#8217;s perception of their own abilities is all over the place (IOW, what they think is not connected to how good they are), while the third says that if you work to become better at something, your ability may or may not improve, but your perception of your own ability will become more accurate.</p>
<p>Put another way; if you want accurate ideas of someone&#8217;s skill level, train them and test them &#8211; the training will get them to self-calibrate, and the tests will be honest.</p>

		<p>This has been going round for years (it even features in &#8220;The Office&#8221; (UK) Christmas Special) and was studied a few years ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bu.edu/today/2014/bu-research-riddle-reveals-the-depth-of-gender-bias/" rel="nofollow">https://www.bu.edu/today/2014/bu-research-riddle-reveals-the-depth-of-gender-bias/</a></p>
<p>Nature or nurture, we won&#8217;t know for a long time. But just because you&#8217;re biased doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re bad. How you deal with your bias does.</p>

		<p>As a side note, I don&#8217;t like anti-discrimination or wrongful termination laws, though I am willing to compromise. I suggest a compromise to only include certain kinds of jobs like manual labor under employment anti-discrimination laws, where workers are actually commodities that are measureable and interchangeable.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
