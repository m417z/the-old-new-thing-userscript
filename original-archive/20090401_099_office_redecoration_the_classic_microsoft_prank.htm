<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/"> Tim Sneath</a> reminds us that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2006/12/13/the-microsoft-office-prank.aspx"> it is a long-standing tradition Microsoft tradition to prank someone's office while they are out</a> (<a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=27781">here's a video of Larry Osterman's tales of prankdom</a>).</p>
<p> When I <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/04/6648244.aspx"> went to see a Thunderbirds hockey game a few years back</a>, I avoided mentioning at the time that seeing the game served a secondary purpose. I attended the game with a couple of friends, one of whom had never seen a live hockey game before. It so happened that his fianc&eacute;e wanted to prank his office, so our little hockey outing was a way to keep him occupied for a while, giving his fianc&eacute;e the opportunity to sneak into his office and, along with several other friends, to give the room some of that holiday spirit. </p>
<p> They went nuts with the gift wrap, wrapping not only his door, computer, keyboard, and mouse, but also his pens and coffee mug. They left figurines on his bookshelf, strung lights and garlands, and even set a half-scale papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; reindeer on the floor of the office. But the best part was their calling card: They left behind a list of <a href="http://christmas.howstuffworks.com/santa-claus1.htm"> who's naughty and nice</a>. In the "Nice" column, they put my friend's name. In the "Naughty" column were the names of all the pranksters. </p>

		<p>Heh, a very similar prank was pulled on one of my coworkers a year or two ago when he was on vacation. &nbsp;Not only did they giftwrap everything on his desk, including small things like pens and pencils, but they also giftwrapped his entire desk. &nbsp;To top it off, they changed his desktop wallpaper to an image of more giftwrap.</p>

		<p>Preemptive snarky comment (R): That&#8217;s what you spend the time at Microsoft instead of fixing all those humongous bugs of Windows Vista!</p>

		<p>That makes me think of a Lead&#8217;s office, a blue tarp, 1400 pounds of sand, beach chairs, umbrellas, wall paint, etc. Somehow it all ended up in a fifth floor office while he was off getting married on the beach.</p>
<p>I miss those days. The most ingenious &quot;prank&quot; anyone around can come up with is an old photo of someone with the phrase &quot;Lordy, lordy &lt;person&gt; is 40&quot; on it posted several dozen times throughout the building. I&#8217;m so sick and tired of those.</p>

		<p>This kind of thing has become something of a regular feature on the NZ TV sports comedy show &quot;Pulp Sport&quot;, where a sports presenter (Hamish McKay) is the subject of a weekly office decoration prank perpetrated by the shows presenters (&quot;Bill and Ben&quot;).</p>
<p>This often extends to his car, or sometimes the prank only involves the car occurs elsewhere in the office building &#8211; like the time Hamish found himself locked in the gents toilet with a flock of sheep.</p>

		<p>I still recall watching from Bldg 17 as people moved someone&#8217;s office from the 3rd floor of 16 out onto the adjacent roof. They had to remove a window to get the office contents outside. Mid-90s, about.</p>

		<p>My favorite Microsoft prank story is the guy who couldn&#8217;t open his office door because of the fully inflated weather balloon inside.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
