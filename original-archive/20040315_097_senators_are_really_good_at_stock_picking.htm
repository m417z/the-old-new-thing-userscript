		<p>More likely is that they were helped into the positions they are in in part due to an understanding of how the market economy works.  It would seem that there is a grey line for unethical behavior of buys/sells that is only defined based on time.  IE. buying a large volume of stocks, and selling quick isn&#8217;t very ethical, but doing the same with a small volume, or over a long time may be.  But there&#8217;s no standard of when exactly it crosses the line&#8230;</p>

		<p>Also, many Senators are quite wealthy, and were quite wealthy before entering the Senate.  I imagine wealthy people tend to have stocks that outperform the market.  A more interesting comparison would be between Senators&#8217; stocks and those of non-Senators of comparable wealth.</p>

		<p>What the researchers did was watch what happened to the stock in the period surrounding the transaction, not by looking at the &quot;hold&quot; stocks.  Seems that when a relatively stable stock is bought by a senator, it starts to rise the very next day.  When a rising stock is sold by a senator, it starts to level off.</p>
<p>So if you bought when senators bought and sold when senators sold, you&#8217;d be doing pretty good.</p>

<p>&#8230;although the LA Times had a pretty good investigation of one senator in particular:<br />

		<p>Senators are really good at stock-picking &#8212; nice find from Raymond Chen. As the comments point out, the causality here is not totally clear. Though a strong suggestion that Senators benefit from their position. Now I thought that Presidents put&#8230;</p>

		<p>i&#8217;m guessing the biggest advantage senators have in stock picking is their understanding of new legislation and how it will affect companies.  For instance, with a new healthcare bill, senators will have a very good idea what companies it will help and which it will hurt.  the thing is it&#8217;s not secret info, theyre just among the few that have to bother to read through it all.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
