The year-end link clearance is here!
You may have noticed that the link clearances are getting shorter and shorter.
I may have to cut back to only one link clearance per year.

    One thing I took away from it is that chocolatiers are quite
    open about where they get their chocolate from.
    Or at least, all reputable chocolatiers.
    Anyway, the Dallas Food blog is at it again with chocolate:

        and um something else I can't remember.
        But basically it was me retelling stories that were
        inspired by the stuff we saw in the room.
        There was very little if any new information.
        So I don't feel too bad that the episode was lost.

The idea is that the One Dev Minute team come to my office every so often

This article</a> [warning: autoplaying audio advertisement]
contains the caption
"This edition of the Microsoft Encarta digital encyclopedia came on massive laserdiscs."
I can't tell if they took us literally or they are just continuing the joke.
That is actually a novelty display box.
The box is empty.
There was no monster-sized laserdisc with a custom laserdisc player.
Also, the title of that linked article is incorrect;
I'll take responsibility for that one because I was being glib in my chatter.
(I didn't realize that I was going to be quoted on a news site.)
I'll clear it up in a future Dev Minute.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s very saddening to hear, but thank you for sharing it.  Michael and Raymond were my must-read blogs for a long time.  I&#8217;m still irritated that his MSDN blog was shut down and deleted &#8212; no idea what precipitated that, but it was such a trove of valuable information that to see it discarded was horrible.</p>
<p>PS: Raymond, the last few blog entries from last year are closed for comments.  Intended?</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Windows 96 ship party&#8221;<br />
I hope you mean Windows 95. I remember using a custom Windows 95 boot screen that said &#8220;Windows 96 with Internet Explorer 4&#8221;. Everybody thought there&#8217;d be a Windows 96 for some reason (My shutdown screen was Brain from &#8220;Pinky and the Brain&#8221; saying &#8220;You may now turn off your simple computer&#8221;. Ah, the memories)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
