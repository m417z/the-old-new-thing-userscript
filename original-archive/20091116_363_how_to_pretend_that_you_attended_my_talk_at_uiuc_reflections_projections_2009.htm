<p>
<b>Step 3</b>:
Trim wrapper on registration marks and wrap around candy bar.

<p>
<b>Step 4</b>:
Stay up late the night before you plan on watching the video
by partying with

Ryan North</a>
and

teaching him how to play beer pong</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 5</b>:
Force yourself to wake up the next morning and watch

the recorded video</a>
of
<a HREF="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/chen.html">

The candy bar might help.

		<p>@ChrisR: Raymond is helping you to get the full conference-experience in the comfort of your own home. Although I&#8217;d happily forgo the pleasure of 4&#189; of the 5 items and just watch the video in the evening, some people are probably pining for the rest of it. Whatever rocks your boat&#8230; :-)</p>

		<p>Aw, Amazon is giving a 404 for that link now.</p>
<p>And what the heck! When MS came to my school&#8217;s career fair, they handed out small boxes of laundry detergent (really) with that design. More useful than a candy bar, maybe, but much less tasty.</p>

		<p>Raymond seemed very nervous during the talk. Any slashdot attendees? :P Relax Raymond !</p>
<p>Anyway, I enjoyed the talk. I dislike talks with tons of slides and the speaker just reads them out. Another fantastic speaker is John Carmack. His Quakecon speeches are legendary. He just stands there for an hour w/o any slides or material and talks about really interesting topics.</p>
<p>Since we now know the secret of how to get Raymond to attend conferences, We need more people to invite Raymond and get him to talk about esoteric coding topics !</p>

		<p>The big problem is that it is a 100-200MB download that took hours at 10k/s, only to see a little square of motion in the corner and mostly static slides. We would be much better served by a 30MB audio file.</p>
<p>Obviously Raymond has no control over this, it just makes me wish that he had more slides so the bandwidth didn&#8217;t feel like such a waste.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
