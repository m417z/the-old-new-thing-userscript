I noted some time ago that
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180725-00/?p=99335">
the current implementation of NTFS forces certain
kinds of writes to be synchronous, even when issued
asynchronously</a>.
Note that this is an implementation decision which is not
contractual.
Formally, the rule is that any asynchronous operation is
permitted (but not required) to complete synchronously.
</p>
<p>
Malcolm Smith points out that
<a HREF="https://www.osr.com/nt-insider/2015-issue2/maintaining-valid-data-length/">
the ReFS file system does not force extending writes to be synchronous</a>.
Specifically,
ReFS version 1 (Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2)
allowed cached writes to the end of a file to complete
asynchronously,
and ReFS version 2 (Windows 10 version 1607, Windows Server 2016)
maintains validity on a per-range basis,
so the need to zero out huge chunks of a file disappears
completely.</p>

		<p>Windows 10 version 1607 could not use ReFS v2. Because hasn&#8217;t refs.sys, has refsv1.sys only.</p>

		<p>Hasn&#8217;t ReFS been removed from newer versions of Windows?  There&#8217;s been this creeping strangulation of ReFS over Windows versions in the last twelve months or so, with only R/W capability remaining in most cases.</p>

		<p>ReFS is effectively dead. It has never lived up to any of the features it promised over NTFS &#8211; in particular, its supposed ability to automatically detect and repair bit rot, probably its main drawcard, has been proven to simply not work in many scenarios. That, coupled with all its limitations compared to NTFS, means it just isn&#8217;t a viable replacement, and I expect Microsoft will officially sunset ReFS with the next version of Windows Server.</p>

		<p>As long ago as TOPS-10&#8217;s DA queue, the fact that file extension is inherently single-threaded surfaced as a baffling and intractable bottleneck.  But making it asynchronous is the wrong approach.  How compensate errors?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
