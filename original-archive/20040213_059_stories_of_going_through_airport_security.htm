<p>I went through security three times at <a href="http://www.portseattle.org/seatac/"> Seattle-Tacoma International Airport</a> before my flight to <a href="http://www.panynj.gov/aviation/ewrframe.HTM"> Newark</a>.</p>
<p> My original flight was cancelled due to <a href="http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2004/01/28/328184-ap.html"> inclement weather in Newark</a>, so I get rescheduled onto another flight that arrived three hours later. I thought to myself, "That's strange. Both flights are going to Newark. It's not like the weather in Newark is nicer on the second flight." </p>
<p> Not surprisingly, after about an hour, the second flight was also cancelled. </p>
<p> Anyway, when going through security the first time, I spotted the monitor on one of the X-ray machines and was somewhat amused to see <a href="http://www.winhistory.de/more/win98.htm"> the Windows&nbsp;98 boot screen</a>. Windows&nbsp;98: Not dead yet. (Actually, this was probably Windows&nbsp;98 Embedded. I remember having to debug a problem with Windows&nbsp;<b>95</b> Embedded just last year. The product key validation algorithm was failing because the "issued date" in the product key was failing a sanity check and being rejected as "ridiculously out of range".) I decided not to take a picture, though. Security people get really nervous when you take their picture... </p>
<p> While going through security the second time, they decided that my knitting needles may be a problem. This was the first time anybody had given me trouble over my needles. Eventually they decided that I wasn't going to attack somebody by poking them with a knitting needle, but not before doing a more detailed search of my bag and my person. (Mind you, they were Number 2 needles, pointier than your average knitting needle.) </p>
<p> On my return from Newark to Seattle, the security person also made note of my knitting needles, but only to compliment me on my hobby. </p>

		<p>Actually, the second flight was on a competitor&#8217;s airline. That&#8217;s why I had to go through security a second time: The other airline was in a different terminal.</p>

		<p>The illusion of security that our (The U.S.) government has created with the TSA probably has no more practical value than to inconvenience many more people than was ever possible before.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to get my airplane built. I *depsise* going through security in American airports.  (Put a small minded person in a position of authority and they&#8217;ll say, &quot;no&quot; to anything because it&#8217;s the only power they have.)</p>

<p>This is why I love to fly in East-Asian countries. I had my bag of camera-film hand checked (as opposed to X-rayed) every flight during my last trip in Thailand and China. But when I came back to Sweden it was immediately a BIG no-no. I mean there were at least five people doing the security-check and I was the only person in the queue&#8230;*sigh*&#8230;</p>

		<p>My mother *always* gets her knitting needles taken away on flights.  I have actually quit taking my knitting on airplanes just to avoid that problem.  </p>
<p>Part of me wants to look at a screener, put my purse and my knitting needles on the table in front of them and say, &quot;Pick one to use as a weapon, I will attack you with the other,&quot; and see which item they thought was more dangerous in that situation.  There is no way they will ever choose the knitting needles (especially not my little bamboo ones).  Unfortunately, I think they would frown upon that&#8230;.</p>

		<p>Print out this page from the TSA and take it with you next time:</p>

<p>A strange policy, though &#8212; knitting needles are allowed unless the TSA screener says they&#8217;re not.</p>

		<p>I haven&#8217;t flown since Oct 2000, and I hated flying *before*&#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine doing it now.  Everything about flying is so repulsive, from the airport smelling of jet exhaust to lines to the cramped seats [I&#8217;m 6&#8217;4&quot;]. :(</p>

		<p>If you understand german there is a nice article at Heise Telepolis about security at Las Vegas Airport.</p>
<p><a target="_new" href="http://www.heise.de/tp/deutsch/inhalt/co/16711/1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.heise.de/tp/deutsch/inhalt/co/16711/1.html</a></p>
<p>A german journalist who just came from a conferense on Homeland Security went through security without a ticket (left it somewhere at the airport) and with a wrong name on her boarding pass (wasn&#8217;t noticed by security). As her american travelling companion said: &quot;Very disturbing&quot;.</p>

<p>Same here. Maybe it&#8217;s in the name. ;) And haven&#8217;t scientists discovered that the average human height is increasing with each generation? I guess the President of Airplane Seat Arrangement™ in most airlines simply doesn&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>An aquaintance of mine was flying a year or so after 9/11, and was surprised by the eating utensils the passengers were served. Plastic disposable knives, and a metal, long prong, fork.</p>
<p>He wondered if anyone in the decision-making process for that choice of utensils had realized the damage one can do with a metal fork.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that business-class passengers were given the honor of being trusted with metal knives was also more than just slightly disturbing&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
