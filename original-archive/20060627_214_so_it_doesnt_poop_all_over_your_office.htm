		<p>I&#8217;ve recently walked into an elevator to be greeted by &quot;That&#8217;s what he gets for sleeping with h&#8230;ers.&quot; Quite off color, but also on topic.</p>
<p>By the w ay, I would bet your conversation had to do with a diaper for a dog or monkey.</p>

		<p>My money&#8217;s on mice. &nbsp;They tend to be locationally generative when it comes to pooping. &nbsp;We don&#8217;t make scalable &#8216;restrooms&#8217; for mice to utilize. &nbsp;They may be frightened into pooping by their mechanical counterparts&#8230;</p>

		<p>Pet Rabbits. They poop all over the place, and I believe Americans love them as pets. In Europe, we just eat them. :-)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m gonna go for code. &nbsp;So it doesn&#8217;t poop all over your office seems like an interesting way to say &quot;so it doesn&#8217;t break and cause lots of noise.&quot;</p>

		<p>Well, I&#8217;m pretty sure I was part of this conversation, but I don&#8217;t remember what we were talking about now. &nbsp;It was either children or actual pets, I think.</p>

		<p>there is a basic human need to express poop whether in the office, &nbsp;on a mountain or in a tiny room on out of sight of the adoring public. &nbsp;Accept it. &nbsp;Poop happens</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
