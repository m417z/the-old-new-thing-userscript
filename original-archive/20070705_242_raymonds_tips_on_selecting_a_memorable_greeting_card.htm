<p>My favorite greeting card is one I got from <a href="http://www.wendyhome.com/"> ::&nbsp;Wendy&nbsp;::</a>. It was a Christmas card with <a href="http://www.galison.com/Snow-in-Kazan-Holiday-Cards-P614C203.aspx"> a picture of kids running around while snow fell all around them</a>. Wendy added the message, "Watch out for that 'rogue' snowball from midfield..." I still have that card on my windowsill years later.</p>
<p> My recommendation for choosing a memorable greeting card is to go to the wrong aisle in the greeting card store. I always start with the "blank cards" aisle since you can look for a picture that sets an interesting scene (like Wendy's snowball fight) and then add a short message inside. </p>
<p> Last year, I went to the Sympathy aisle to get a birthday card for a friend who was trying not to show his concern over turning 30. After some searching, I found the perfect card. It was your usual sappy sympathy card with flowers and birds on the cover and some text about peace and comfort. And on the inside, it simply said, "Hope you feel better soon." I added, "Happy birthday." </p>

		<p>Slightly off topic but I didn&#8217;t know you and Wendy knew each other. Weird. The internet is a small world I guess. She has a very interesting parenting background. How many other English/Finnish people are there in the world? I lived in Finland for many years and I know of only one other than Wendy.</p>

		<p>I do that too, for example for a christmas card I got my brother a birthday card, and then at the bottom I wrote &quot;wait a minute, you&#8217;re not Jesus! &nbsp;Merry Christmas&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s been done before, but I like it.</p>

		<p>jeradc &nbsp;&#8211; that is the card.</p>
<p>Get well soon cards can be made to work for all sorts of people or events: graduation, marriage, babys arriving, divorce, promotion. &nbsp;I recommend keeping a stock of blank and get well soon cards in house for all your emergency greeting card needs. &nbsp;you know it makes sense.</p>
<p>PS sending the get well soon card to a recent ex-spouse requires expert skill, &nbsp;seek an experts advice before sending.</p>

		<p>A friend of mine, when traveling, has a habit of sending postcards of a city other than the one he is visiting (from Rome, he would send a New York card, etc). This tends to make them memorable because one has to think which city they actually currently are visiting (usually, he only writes cryptic clues on the card).</p>

		<p>When my wife turned 40, I went to the kiddie card section, got a Barbie card that said on the front something like &quot;The princess is turning 4&quot; and appended a zero to make it 40. That&#8217;s the best card I&#8217;ve ever given to anyone.</p>

		<p>My trick: &nbsp;pick any card that has lots of words, then just cross out all the words you don&#8217;t mean. &nbsp;This is A LOT of work, but the results can be tremendous.</p>

		<p>My personal favorite is to mix and match the outside and inside of different cards. Not only does that make for some really ridiculous cards, it doubles as a fun greeting-store game to pass the time.</p>

<p>Do cards no longer acquire postmarks?</p>

		<p>If you purchase a recently issued stamp, you can send your post card to the issuing post office to have them postmark it and forward it to the final recipient.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
