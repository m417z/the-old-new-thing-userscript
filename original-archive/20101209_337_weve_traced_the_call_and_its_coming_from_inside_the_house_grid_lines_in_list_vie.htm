<p>
A customer wanted to know how to remove the grid lines from
a list view control in report mode.
The customer was kind enough to include the source code for
the relevant part of the program and drew our attention to the
line in the resource file that he believed to be the source of the
problem:
</p>
<pre>
CONTROL "",IDC_LIST,WC_LISTVIEW,LVS_REPORT|LVS_SHOWSELALWAYS|
       LVS_SINGLESEL|WS_HSCROLL|WS_TABSTOP|WS_VSCROLL,
       0,40,225,95,WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE
</pre>
<p>
The customer didn't know it, but that line in the resource
file was of no help at all in diagnosing the problem.
Fortunately, we found the root cause in the source code
provided:
</p>
<pre>
void CListPage::OnInitDialog()
{
  ...
  ListView_SetExtendedListViewStyleEx( hCtrl, 0,
     LVS_EX_FULLROWSELECT |
     <u>LVS_EX_GRIDLINES</u> |
     LVS_EX_LABELTIP |
     LVS_EX_HEADERINALLVIEWS);
</pre>
<p>
The grid lines are there because you explicitly asked for them!
</p>
<p>
The customer accepted this answer without response.
One of my colleagues suspected how this situation came about:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
If I may guess, the initial developer of the code did what
the spec required at the time, which was to have grid lines.
The initial developer then left the company, and a new
developer inherited the code.
</p>
<p>
Now the design team changed their mind and asked for the grid
lines to be removed,
but the new developer doesn't know the history of the code
and therefore doesn't know where in the code the grid lines
are turned on or even know that the default state for
grid lines is <i>off</i> and that
you have to turn them on explicitly.
</p>
<p>
Chances are within the next two months,
the design team will change their mind again and the developer
will have to put the grid lines back,
but at least this time he knows how to do it.
</p>
</blockquote>

		<p>@asf: Without more information, I&#39;d give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that the word &quot;grid&quot; appeared an enormous number of times in the source tree, which makes finding the relevant one difficult. &nbsp;Of course, if he&#39;d bothered to look at the documentation for ListView styles (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb774739%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/bb774739%28VS.85%29.aspx</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb774732%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/bb774732%28VS.85%29.aspx</a>), he&#39;d know to search for LVX_EX_GRIDLINES.</p>

		<p>Interesting that they set their EX styles in the code rather than in the resource file in the first place. &nbsp;Seems to indicate whoever set up the grid style might not have known about the resource file or how they work.</p>

		<p>How about turning off full row selection in list view list mode beginning with Vista which leaves no space for clicking an empty space? No choice there at all? Drives me mad.

		<p>Part of the reasons that I buy my MSDN subscription is that I might need support in situation like this.</p>
<p>This is somewhat common in software industry &#8211; You&#39;re given a project someone has worked on and leaved *written in a language you barely have experience with* (say, just because you mentioned your FYP is written in Java in high school), and told to have one week to get yourself familiar with that and work on. With MSDN subscription&#39;s support at least I get support for more than half among the most commonly used languages in the world.</p>
<p>If you have time, you may dive in MSDN documentation to search for related information. But if you&#39;re in rush (say, in extreme situation, I had to face 5 one-man project at once. Two of which in languages that I barely had previous experience), you may just want to get expert to deal with question seems likely to be common, and focus on your tasks.</p>

		<p>Right clicking isn&#39;t useful in dialog boxes where the user has to select x files and then click an &quot;Open&quot; button.</p>

		<p>Yes I will try to explain it. In common dialogs like Load/Open dialog, the user wants to select one or more files and click the Open button to open them. Here the full row selection annoys. Right clicking shows a menu, I don&#39;t want to show a context menu, I only want to select items and click Open. </p>

		<p>ListView does not have this annoyance in List View List mode before Vista and in Windows 7, ItemsView does not have this annoyance either. Only ListView in Vista and later has this.</p>

		<p>If you *drag and select* files (drag from an empty area), full row selection makes it very difficult. Therefore this full row selection in List view list mode should be a configurable extended style like there is LVS_EX_FULLROWSELECT for report mode.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
