<p>Suppose your application crashes and debugger&nbsp;X is automatically connected because that's how the system happened to be configured. But you would prefer to use debugger&nbsp;Y. After installing debugger&nbsp;Y, how do you switch the debugger from X&nbsp;to&nbsp;Y? If you try to connect debugger&nbsp;Y to the process, you get the error code <code>STATUS_PORT_ALREADY_SET</code>, because only one debugger can be connected to a process at a time. But if you disconnect the old debugger, the application will disappear with it. How do you escape from this Catch-22?</p>
<p> Here's what you do. </p>
<ul>
<li>Attach the ntsd debugger in non-invasive mode:     use -pv instead of -p when specifying the process id. </li>
<li>The ntsd debugger will suspend all the threads in the process. </li>
<li>Now tell debugger&nbsp;X to resume the process and detach from it.     (If debugger&nbsp;X is ntsd,     then the command for this is <code>qd</code>.) </li>
<li>Next, tell debugger&nbsp;Y to attach to the process. </li>
<li>Finally, go to the ntsd debugger which you attached in non-invasive mode,     and tell it to detach with the <code>qd</code> command. </li>
</ul>
<p> This trick works because the non-invasive mode of debugging doesn't actually connect to the process as a debugger. It merely suspends all the threads in the process and lets you snoop around its memory. As a result, when you disconnect the original debugger and tell it to resume execution of the application, the application doesn't actually resume because the non-invasive ntsd is keeping it suspended. You then can attach the new debugger to the process and resume your debugging. </p>
<p> In other words, the non-invasive ntsd acts as a bridge, holding the process frozen while one debugger gets out and another one comes in. </p>

		<p>For me more interesting would be how to select the right debugger for a crashing app, let it be a certain Visual Studio version or WinDbg.</p>
<p>I have installed WinDbg, but prefer normally after a crash that Visual Studio comes up.</p>

		<p>If the only reason for engaging ntsd is to suspend the process, couldn&#8217;t you also use Process Explorer for this? You could right-click and select suspend the process, disconnect the default debugger, connect the preferred debugger, then right-click and select resume.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Sure, you could do that too. But at least around here, ntsd is probably one of the two debuggers involved in the handoff, thereby avoiding the &#8220;now you have two problems&#8221; problem. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>It&#8217;s much easier to find a utility called Debug Chooser written by John Robbins (who used to do the Bugslayer column @ MSJ).</p>
<p>He wrote an app that would let you choose which debugger to run when a GPF occurred.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t find an online copy of the relevant MSJ edition (Jan 2000) so this will have to do:</p>

		<p>I guess suspending the process using Process Explorer (Sysinternals tools) would have the same effect?</p>

		<p>Is it also possible to tell the Windows error report generator to detach from a process? I would like it to be enabled by default since most crashes are usually not my fault. I wish there were an extra button on its dialog, &quot;switch to WinDbg&quot;.</p>

<p>Apart from Debug Chooser which Paul suggested, there&#8217;s also a similar tool &#8211; &quot;jitmgr&quot;, written by Great. It uses a bit different approach compared to Debug Chooser.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
