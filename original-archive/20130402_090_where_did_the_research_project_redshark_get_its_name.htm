<p>Project code names are not arrived at by teams of focus groups who carefully parse out every semantic and etymological nuance of the name they choose. (Though if you read the technology press, you'd believe otherwise, because it turns out that taking a code name apart syllable-by-syllable searching for meaning is a great way to fill column-inches.) Usually, they are just spontaneous decisions, inspired by whatever random thoughts jump to mind.</p>
<p> Many years ago, there was an internal user interface research project code named <i>RedShark</i>. Not <i>Red Shark</i> but <i>RedShark</i>, accent on the <i>Red</i>. Where did this strange name come from? </p>
<p> From a red shark, of course. </p>
<p> When the project started up, the people in charge were sitting around and realized they needed to give the project a name. It so happened that the office they were sitting in belonged to a team member who collected a lot of strange toys. One of those toys was an small inflatable red shark. </p>
<p> Somebody looked around the room and spotted the red shark. "Let's call it RedShark." Nobody else had a better idea, so the name passed by default. </p>
<p> That small inflatable red shark became their mascot and hung from the ceiling in the hallway. </p>
<p> No deep, hidden meaning. Just a $3 cheap plastic toy that happened to be in the right place at the right time. </p>

		<p>I once put an algorithm in the final report for a grad class research project that we called the &quot;blue algorithm&quot; because when we were trying to figure out what to do, we put a couple possibilities up on the whiteboard in different colors, and it happened to be blue.</p>

		<p>That story sounds all too familiar to me. One of the projects I work on one was code named &quot;Bobcat&quot; about 7 years ago, and is still known by that name today. &nbsp;There have been many hypotheses about how that name came about, but the truth is that there just happened to be a large piece of earth moving equipment produced by Bobcat (the earth moving equipment company) in a teammate&#39;s drive way near the beginning of the project, and he liked the name. The rest is a surprisingly accurate analogue of this story.</p>

		<p>While working at a major telecom company back in the 90s, I had to deal with a system named Route 7. It sounds like it should be meaningful since the primary function of a telecom company is to route calls (and bill for them), but it was simply named for the major state highway that passed near the original development team&#39;s building.</p>

		<p>@Nawak:</p>
<p>In American English at least, multi-syllable words tend to have one of the syllables stressed or accented. &nbsp;For example my name, Michael, has two syllables and most people would say the first syllable slightly more lightly than the second.</p>
<p>&quot;Red Shark&quot;, being two separate words, would not have either of them accented except as appropriate (e.g. rising tone at the end of a question like &quot;Oh you got bitten by a red shark?&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;RedShark&quot;, being a single word with two syllables would have one of them emphasized.</p>
<p>I have been told by my friends from India that this accenting or stressing does not occur so it&#39;s been something of a challenge to learn proper pronunciation of people&#39;s names since as a native speaker you hardly realize that you&#39;re doing it. &nbsp;I believe the American practice follows traditional English English practice but I can&#39;t say for sure.</p>

		<p>After being sick of all our projects called &quot;Grobber Manager&quot;, or &quot;Grobber Management System&quot;, I decided I wanted a project named &quot;Hyperion Pro&quot;.</p>
<p>Hyperion, one of Saturn&#39;s moons. And &quot;pro&quot; because it sounds cooler than &quot;Hyperion Standard&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t care what the project is; I&#39;ve just picked out the name.</p>

		<p>@Michael Grier,</p>
<p>Probably for the most part, though there are some well known exceptions. &nbsp;&quot;Bernard&quot; in American English is stressed on the second syllable; in British English, on the first syllable. &nbsp;In terms of ordinary words there is a big difference between American &quot;laboratory&quot; (first and third syllables stressed, second vowel tending to disappear) and British &quot;laboratory&quot; (second syllable stressed, fourth vowel tending to disappear).</p>

		<p>I once code-named a project &quot;Alice&quot; because (a) other projects had a tendency towards wow-look-at-me names that emphasized some big/fast/cool factor, and (b) I was reading Lewis Carroll at the time.</p>

		<p>@EvanED,</p>
<p>The free portion of Interstate 476 in Pennsylvania is called the &quot;blue route&quot; for that exact reason. There were multiple alternatives for where to build it and the eventual winner happened to be blue on the original map. (The toll section is much less interestingly called &quot;The Northeast Extension (of the Pennsylvania Turnpike)&quot;)</p>

<p>I read that as more the *emphasis* was on the fact that it was red, not that it was a shark. I.e. Project RedShark might have absolutley nothing in common with Project BlueShark, despite the common word &quot;shark&quot;</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I mean it in the sense Michael gave. The word &quot;Red&quot; is spoken louder than &quot;Shark&quot;. In casual conversation, when you say &quot;I saw the red shark today&quot;, the emphasis is on the word &quot;shark&quot;. But if you&#39;re talking about the project, you would put emphasis on the word &quot;red&quot;. No explanation was ever given; that&#39;s just how it was. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>When we started my current company we decided we wanted our project names to have a theme. After casting around for a bit we decided on rock bands. We figured this had many advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>A near-endless well of distinctive names, such that each major release could get its own band.</li>
<li>
<p>We could assign different sub-genres to different products. The mapping product would get classic rock, the mobile viewer gets blues-rock, the design product get metal bands (for reasons simply related to the tastes of the personnel involved).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For point releases we could use band member last names. Our 2.0 mapping product project was Zeppelin, 2.1 was Plant, 2.2 was Page, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The runner-up theme was &quot;battles the French lost&quot; but it only had the &quot;near-endless well of names&quot; factor going for it ;)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
