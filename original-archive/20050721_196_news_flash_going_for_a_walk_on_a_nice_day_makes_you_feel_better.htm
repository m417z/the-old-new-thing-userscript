		<p>I think it is reassuring to know that something we take for granted is actually backed by raw scientific data? :-)</p>

		<p>I get miffed by studies like these. I mean, we know the effect of light on our mood (versus darkness), we also know the effect of sun on our well being (Vitamin D production, etc), we know the benefits of walking, so did they really need to spend time and money to conclude that the three combined would improve our mood? I just hope this study wasn&#8217;t tax-payer funded&#8230; :)</p>

		<p>To a scientist, common sense isn&#8217;t so until proven by an eight year study.</p>

		<p>Although probably you are all just being sarcastic, Kent Boogart is actually right. If we accepted &#8216;common sense&#8217; as scientifical facts, we would still believe the earth was flat and washing your car is a great way to make it rain.</p>
<p>It is a good thing that common wisdoms like these are evaluated scientifically because often enough they are plain wrong.</p>
<p>That said, I doubt the results and conclusion of the study were so simple as the title suggests. Slaven dismisses the study as obvious, but he hasn&#8217;t even bothered to read the article; if he had, he would have known that the effect of exercise was factored out in the study (the subject of the study being the weather, not the walking).</p>

		<p>&quot;Slaven dismisses the study as obvious, but he hasn&#8217;t even bothered to read the article; if he had, he would have known that the effect of exercise was factored out in the study (the subject of the study being the weather, not the walking).&quot;</p>
<p>I just listed all the reasons this study would be a foregone conclusion, granted I did not spend near enough time to really analyze the findings (after all, I do think enough time was wasted on it already!). I think the obvious part of the study is actually exposure to sun, since there have been many studies that proved it long ago, and effect it has on mood of people living if far north like Norway and Sweden. I just think there are a lot more urgent areas of study available to them.</p>
<p>What would be a worthwhile study would be telling us if the benefits of walking in the sun outweigh potential risks of skin cancer. :)</p>

		<p>The thing I hate most about this is how judgmental it is about weather.</p>
<p>Their study shows that (most) people are happier after being in &quot;sunny&quot; weather.  That is not what I call &quot;nice&quot; weather at all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happiest after walking to work when it&#8217;s about 65F, with a light breeze, and either cloudy or misty.  That&#8217;s what I call &quot;nice&quot; weather.</p>
<p>When the local weatherperson says it will be &quot;nice&quot; outside, I know it will be dreadful: &gt;90F and blindingly bright.  Walking in such weather just makes you hot and sweaty, not something I fully appreciate being.</p>

		<p>I have just read Richard Feynman&#8217;s The Pleasure of Finding Things Out, so I cannot resist to say that he was right about those pseudosciences and the cargo-cult science&#8230; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science</a>)</p>

		<p>And it today&#8217;s news, scientists discover that eating healthy is good for you, and that double helping of chili cheese fries isn&#8217;t.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
