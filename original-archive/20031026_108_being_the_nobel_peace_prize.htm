<p>         For Hallowe'en this year, I'm going to be <a href="http://www.nobel.se/peace/">the         Nobel Peace Prize</a>. (I like being things that people would never         even think of as a possible Hallowe'en costume. Last year, I was an inter-office envelope.         People addressed me from place to place.)      </p>
<p>         I chose the Nobel Peace Prize in part because I'm studying Swedish so I thought it         would be fun to be something Swedish.          Except that <a href="http://www.nobel.no/">the Nobel Peace Prize is Norwegian</a>!         Oh, the horror!      </p>
<p>         But what's done is done. I already made the medal and have started making the diploma,         but I hit a snag: Whose name should be on the Prize?      </p>
<p>         I could go historical and reproduce the <a href="http://www.nobel.se/peace/laureates/2002/carter-diploma.html">2002         Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Jimmy Carter</a>. (He's my favorite of the recent Peace         Prize recipients.)      </p>
<p>         Or I could go surreal and create an imaginary award to be bestowed upon Jennifer Lopez         or maybe David Hasselhoff.      </p>
<p>         Or I could just leave the space blank and invite people to nominate a winner.      </p>
<p>         My other problem is making the check for SEK 10,000,000. I asked my friend in Sweden         what a check looks like and he says he's never seen one. He doesn't know anybody who         actually writes checks. The closest I could find is <a href="http://www.ssrs.se/2002/sthlmsmassan_donation.htm">this         novelty check</a> but it doesn't look very convincing. (There's no bank name or check number, for         example.)  So I'm asking you for help. Can somebody describe what a Swedish check looks like?      </p>

		<p>Why do you need a Swedish cheque if the Nobel Peace Prize is actually Norwegian? :)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t answer your question though.</p>

<p>Also a suggestion for the name on the check is Shirin Ebadi, since she&#8217;s the Nobel Peace Price Winner of 2003. But maybe it would be funnier to have Mickey Mouse on the check or someone like that :-)</p>

		<p>Although the Nobel Peace Prize is run by a Norwegian committee, the cash prize comes from The Nobel Foundation, which is Swedish, and the payment is in the form of Swedish Kronor.</p>
<p>Thanks for the links. I had found only one on my own so I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was for real, but having pictures of several I feel more confident that I can put together something reasonably authentic. (As authentic as a novelty check ever is.)</p>
<p>I feel better knowing that I got it right, even if nobody else can tell the difference.  (I&#8217;m even careful to forge the signatures on the diploma &quot;correctly&quot;.)</p>

		<p>The reason no-one (almost) in Sweden can give You a good pic of a check is that this old-style-payment where abandoned several years ago. I&#8217;m sure some old folks still keep it somewhere. This can be troblesome, I&#8217;ve noticed where travelling abroad and hiring apartments as they alwas wants a checkdeposit&#8230;</p>

		<p>I have some code for validation of Scandinavian bank account numbers if that helps &#8211; the check will not look any more realistic but at least you will be able to say that the bank account number and sort code combination are valid&#8230;..</p>
<p>You multiple the first 11 digits of the account number by the weights 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0 then MOD the result by 11.  The account number is valid if the last digit of that result is the last digit of the bank account number&#8230;.simple, eh?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
