We saw some time ago that
the operating system generates spurious <code>WM_<wbr>MOUSE&shy;MOVE</code>
messages
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031001-00/?p=42343">
as a side effect of mouse cursor recalculations</a>.
In a sense, the way to kick-start a mouse cursor recalculation
is to pretend that the mouse moved.
And if you see a continuous stream of spurious
<code>WM_<wbr>MOUSE&shy;MOVE</code> messages,
then it suggests that there is
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20090617-00/?p=17863">
some continuous activity</a>
that is triggering mouse cursor recalculation.
</p>
<p>
A customer discovered that their program receive spurious
<code>WM_<wbr>MOUSE&shy;MOVE</code> messages
at a rate of approximately one every two seconds.
They were able to narrow down the conditions and
found that it occurred when the
Hyper-V Manager
or Resource Monitor were running.
What is it about those two programs that is causing
all the spurious mouse activity?
</p>
<p>
The common thread is that these program have a continuously
updating window
that refreshes (you guessed it) every two seconds.
At each refresh, the programs do a
<code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;REDRAW</code> to disable redrawing
in their window, then they update all their stuff,
and then they do another
<code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;REDRAW</code> to re-enable redrawing.
</p>
<p>
We saw some time ago that
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110124-00/?p=11683">
the window manager provides a default implementation of the
<code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;REDRAW</code> message</a>
which makes the window pseudo-invisible when redraw is disabled,
and then undoes all the weird fakery when redraw is re-enabled.
</p>
<p>
Undoing the weird fakery is where the spurious
<code>WM_<wbr>MOUSE&shy;MOVE</code> messages
are coming from.
Making a window pseudo-visible means, among other things,
that if the cursor is inside the window that just became pseudo-visible,
the window needs to be told,
"Hey, you have the mouse cursor.
Set the cursor to something appropriate."
</p>
<p>
And that's what's triggering the spurious mouse move messages
every two seconds.
</p>
<p>
If processing mouse-move messages is expensive for your program,
you can watch to see if
you receive a mouse move message that matches the coordinates
of the previous message.
If so, and your program state hasn't changed between the two messages,
then ignore the spurious message.
(Of course, if your program state <i>has</i> changed,
then you will want to reprocess the message,
because the answer to the question might be different the second time
around.)</p>

		<p>Does Windows send WM_MOUSEMOVE message if the user has another pointing device instead of mouse?</p>
<p>By the way, Raymond, I noticed you fixed your blog&#8217;s font problem. Thanks a lot.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
