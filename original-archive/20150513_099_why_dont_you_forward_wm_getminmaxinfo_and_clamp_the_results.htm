<p>In my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/05/04/10611928.aspx"> illustration of how to make a window resizable in only one direction</a>, commenter Josua asks, "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/05/04/10611928.aspx#10612099">Why don't you forward <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;MIN&shy;MAX&shy;INFO</wbr></code> and clamp the results</a>?"</p>
<p> I'm going to assume the question is really "Why don't you forward <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;MIN&shy;MAX&shy;INFO</wbr></code> before clamping the results?" rather than "Why did you bother writing all this code in the first place? Why not simply forward <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;MIN&shy;MAX&shy;INFO</wbr></code> and clamp the results?"&sup1; </p>
<p> The answer is that forwarding <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;MIN&shy;MAX&shy;INFO</wbr></code> doesn't do anything. As noted in the documentation, the incoming <code>MIN&shy;MAX&shy;INFO</code> structure already has the default values on entry. The default handler for the <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;MIN&shy;MAX&shy;INFO</wbr></code> message returns without doing anything, since all the default handler does is accept the defaults. </p>
<p> So sure, you could forward the message, and then clamp the results, but the forwarding doesn't accomplish anything. </p>
<p> &sup1; In case the question really was "Why did you bother writing all this code in the first place...": Go ahead and delete all the changes aside from the initial version of the <code>On&shy;Get&shy;Min&shy;Max&shy;Info</code> handler. You'll see the problems called out in the text: The resize arrows appear when the mouse hovers over the corners and the left and right edges. And if you maximize the window onto a secondary monitor, and that monitor's height is different from the height of the primary monitor, it maximizes to the wrong height. </p>

		<p>Raymond will occasionally make blog posts in response to comments or other external stimuli. &nbsp;I remember a year or two ago he did a post about the blue screen of death which got picked up by the media and Raymond turned it into blue screen week to clarify misconceptions and elaborate on a topic that was of obvious interested to everyone.</p>

		<p>Indeed no point in forwarding the message for doing nothing. I probably spent too long at high level and missed something because the frameworks handle it; yet I wonder how many programs got broke by this one now because of 4:3 -&gt; 16:9.</p>

		<p>The industry went more like:</p>
<p>4:3 -&gt; 5:4 -&gt; 16:10 -&gt; 16:9</p>
<p>A good developer fix bugs at first occurrence, other developers still have them in their code.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
