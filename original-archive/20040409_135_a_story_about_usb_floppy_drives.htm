<p>A friend of mine used to work on the development of the  <a href="http://www.usb.org/">USB</a> specification and subsequent  implementation.  One of the things that happens at these  meetings is that hardware companies would show off the great  USB hardware they were working on.  It also gave them a chance  to try out their hardware with various USB host manufacturers  and operating systems to make sure everything worked properly  together.</p>
<p>  One of the earlier demonstrations was a company that was making  USB floppy drives.  The company representative talked about how  well the drives were doing and mentioned that they make two versions,  one for PCs and one for Macs.  </p>
<p>  "That's strange," the committee members thought to themselves.  "Why are there separate PC and Mac versions?  The specification  is very careful to make sure that the same floppy drive works  on both systems.  You shouldn't need to make two versions."  </p>
<p>  So one of the members asked the obvious question.  "Why do you have two versions?  What's the difference?  If there's a flaw in our specification, let us know and we can  fix it."  </p>
<p>  The company representative answered,  "Oh, the two floppy drives are completely the same electronically.  The only difference is that the Mac version comes in translucent  blue plastic and costs more."  </p>
<p>  This company was of course not the only one to try to capitalize  on the iMac-inspired translucent plastic craze.  My favorite  is the iMac-styled  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/glance/-/kitchen/B000058521/%22">  George Foreman Grill</a>.  (I'm told the graphite ones cook faster.)  </p>

		<p>Fascinating how much extra people will pay for the prettier version with the same functionality.  I am all for great aesthetics and appealing design, but shouldn&#8217;t form follow function?  I find the trend in consumer products disturbing: it does not have to work great, just be pretty.  Laptop design is something I have been taking particular note of.  Laptops have become quite prettified with curves, two-toned cases, and even glowing logos.  But among my fellow students in my software engineering program, the incidence of early hinge/case failure seems to just the same as it ever was.  (IBM gets points with me for sticking with plain old monolithic black)</p>

		<p>If they want to make a translucent version and charge more, that&#8217;s all well and good.  However, if they say one is only PC compatible and the other is only Mac compatible, then something is wrong.  I would consider that false advertising.</p>

		<p>I doubt they said &quot;compatible only with PCs&quot;. They probably just put a &quot;Mac Compatible&quot; sticker on the Mac one and a &quot;Windows Compatible&quot; sticker on the PC one. Heck, Sony sells USB floppy drives as if they worked only on Sony computers.</p>

		<p>Sony also sells USB headsets for Playstation 2 that work just fine with PC&#8217;s, and if I&#8217;m not mistaken the X-Box memory cards are standard USB devices too but with the wrong connector.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&#8217;t call it false advertising.  If they designed one of them (even if design only means color scheme) to work on a Mac and not a PC, then so be it.  It&#8217;s their product.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m working on a USB-powered microwave oven.</p>
<p>This USB grill is joke, right ? I mean how much power can you draw from USB port (500mA at 5V = 2.5 Watt) ? Maybe it&#8217;s for cooking mini-burgers for the anorexic geeks.</p>

<p>Why don&#8217;t you order one and find out?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
