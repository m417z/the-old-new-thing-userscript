		<p>And the creepy thing is that Jack in the Box is running ads now that feature the mascot in the hospital with a life threatening illness. It makes me wonder did he get sick from eating at his own restaurant? :-)</p>

		<p>A certain large foods store had a recall on their brand of cookies recently. &nbsp;It was related to the Peanuts, though, so it might not be too different.</p>
<p>The worst thing about the tomato recall was that it wasn&#8217;t the tomatoes at fault!</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s been a recent recall of imported (from the U.K.) Stilton cheese in the U.S. and Canada. &nbsp;It&#8217;d be good either in the salad or served after the meal with some port (unfortunately not recalled, as far as I know).</p>

		<p>One of my coworkers has the distinction of visiting a Jack in the Box (on purpose, for he never been there and wanted to go) and not spending the next day making peace offerings to the porcelain altar.</p>
<p>The rest of us avoid naturally.</p>
<p>Still, how did this situation come to pass?</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t have the &quot;Death by Chocolate&quot; recipe handy, but surely it must have some ingredients that may have been subject to recalls.</p>

		<p>@chrismcb</p>
<p> I&#8217;ll admit I got the details wrong. That&#8217;s mainly because I absolutely loathe commercials of *all* kinds. I usually have the mute button active when commercials start and the images that stood out for me was the mascot in the hospital. At any rate, Jack in the Box food is not humane&#8230; :-)</p>

		<p>I mostly go to Jack in the Box, on the principle that they would never let it happen again (and that I can never recall them making a mistake with an order of mine).</p>
<p>Undercooked hamburger meat was pretty common back then, there are even signs in MS cafeterias today that they will not serve undercooked hamburger meat. Steak is fine to have rare, but ground meats should never be served without being fully cooked.</p>
<p>Taco Bell&#8230; I used to go to the one near MS main campus; every other one would make me sick, but that one was OK&#8230; until I learned from someone who used to work there&#8230; That they have &#8216;Tacos&#8217; and &#8216;Chicken Tacos&#8217;, not specifically stating the prior taco type is Beef&#8230; the filling came in boxes labeled &quot;caramel colored taco filling&quot;.</p>

		<p>For a few years after the big Jack in the Box problems, they were by far the cleanest and most meticulously kept restaurant around.</p>
<p>Hamburger patties more than 10 minutes old would get tossed in the trash. &nbsp;In fact, if a single customer reported getting a patty with the slightest bit of red in the middle, the new policies required the cook to be FIRED on the spot. If the cook touched a cooked burger with the same tongs used to handle raw meat, they would be immediately fired.</p>
<p>Whether they are like that anymore I don&#8217;t know, but at the time I considered it the safest restaurant in town.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
