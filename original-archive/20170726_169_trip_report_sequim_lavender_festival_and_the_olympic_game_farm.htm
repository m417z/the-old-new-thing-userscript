My family took a weekend trip to Sequim
for the
<a HREF="http://www.lavenderfestival.com/">
Sequim Lavender Festival</a>,&sup1;
hosted
by the
Sequim Lavender Growers Association,
and which has the nickname
"Lavender Capital of North America."&sup2;
</p>
<p>
Here are my notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want a hotel room for the weekend of the
    lavender festival,
    you need to reserve it early.
    (We booked ours in April.)
    Sequim is not a large town, so their hotel capacity is limited.
</li>
<li>
    The lavender festival itself is not very large by big-city standards.
    About two blocks of street-fair vendors,
    not all of which have a direct tie-in to the lavender theme.
    Many of them are just your usual street fair vendors.
    There is also one short block of food vendors,
    which includes a music performance stage
    and a beer garden.
</li>
<li>
    Traffic on festival weekend is heavy.
    We chose to drive around the sound instead of taking a ferry:
    The ferry is negligibly faster under ideal conditions,
    and conditions were
    <a HREF="http://www.ptleader.com/news/lavender-weekend-in-sequim-to-pack-farms-highway/article_3eac131c-cd21-5c2c-9f36-f02bc159dda8.html">
    less than ideal due to the heavy traffic</a>.
    The wait for the ferry was likely to be a few hours.
    (Furthermore,
    there were three accidents on Highway 101 leading into town,
    which resulted in over an hour of additional delays.)
    As consolation, the driving route took us over the beautiful
    <a HREF="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/TNBhistory/">
    Tacoma Narrows Bridge</a>.
</li>
<li>
    In my experience, the people of Sequim are friendly
    and happy to chat.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before we left Sequim, we paid a visit to the
<a HREF="http://olygamefarm.com/">
Olympic Game Farm</a>.
You drive your car through areas with deer, bison, elk, yak,
peacocks,
and llamas.
(Not all at the same time.)
You also drive past other animal areas,
and there's one place where you park your car and feed the deer
through a wire fence.
(<a HREF="http://olygamefarm.com/animals/">Full list of animals</a>.)
At the gate, you can buy loaves of wheat bread for $2 per loaf,
and this is the only food you can give the animals.
We bought four loaves and used 3&frac12; of them.
The leftover bread we gave to another family at the deer-feeding area.
</p>
<p>
My kids loved the experience of riding along in a car,
feeding animals through rolled-down windows.
The animals are not afraid to stick their entire head
into the car to score some food.
</p>
<p>
When we arrived shortly after the farm opened at 9am, there
was no line.
By 11am,
we found that the animals weren't interested in eating any more.
I guess they were full from their very starchy breakfast.
On our way out, we found a significant line to get in.
</p>
<p>
My suggestion is to avoid the traffic headaches:
Skip the official lavender festival and
create your own.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Most of the lavender farms in the area are
    <a HREF="http://www.lavenderfestival.com/when-are-the-farms-open-this-summer/">
    open all summer</a>,
    not just during festival weekend.
</li>
<li>
    If you're looking for lavender-themed gifts,
    you can go to the
    <a HREF="https://shop.purplehazelavender.com/">
    Purple Haze</a> store downtown.
</li>
<li>
    You will miss out on the giant scoop of
    lavender ice cream from the food stand,
    but you can buy smaller servings at the Purple Haze store downtown.
</li>
<li>
    You will also miss out on chatting with the locals at the festival.
</li>
<li>
    Visit the Olympic Game Farm as soon as they open,
    so you get to feed the animals while they are still hungry.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
&sup1;
Sequim is
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100406-00/?p=14393">
the town
after which
<strike>Service Quality Monitoring</strike>
Software Quality Metrics
was named</a>.
</p>
<p>
&sup2;
I can't find any organization which claims to have
assigned said nickname.
It might very well be self-bestowed.</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t believe I never made the connection between SQM and Sequim, even though everyone pronounced them the same way (skwim, for any non-locals reading).</p>

		<p>So how do you pronounce SQL; skwil?</p>

		<p>The standard pronunciation is &#8220;Postgres-Kyu-Ell&#8221;, which is an exact homophone of &#8220;Postgre-Ess-Kyu-Ell&#8221; so there&#8217;s no room for debate over which is preferable.</p>
<p>Users of nonstandard implementations (a phrase which here means &#8220;implementations which rampantly violate the SQL standard&#8221;) will of course have a nonstandard pronunciation as well.</p>

		<p>Having read the linked 2010 and link-linked 2006 posts about SQM and its undeniable enormous impact on Office design, I&#8217;d like to note that one of the last things I did before I retired from Microsoft was to take the SQM infrastructure *out* of Office clients (it has been supplanted by a new, more flexible instrumentation stack). So I&#8217;m one of the few people to have made Word and Excel smaller. You&#8217;re welcome.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
