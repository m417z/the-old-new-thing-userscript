Say you're minding your own business and you discover that
this process called <code>vmmem</code> is using up all your
memory and CPU.
What is this guy and how do you make him stop?
</p>
<p>
The <code>vmmem</code> process is a virtual process that
the system synthesizes to represent the memory and CPU resources
consumed by your virtual machines.
In other words,
if you see <code>vmmem</code> consuming a lot of memory and CPU resources,
then that means your virtual machines are consuming
a lot of memory and CPU resources.
</p>
<p>
If you want to make it stop,
shut down your virtual machines.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
Strictly speaking, what it actually represents is the resources
of the <i>other</i> virtual machines,
since Windows itself is running in a virtual machine
under the hypervisor.
You may not be explicitly using the hypervisor,
but

some other features are built on top of the hypervisor</a>.</p>

		<p>I believe you are right. The bonus chatter hints about a bare-metal hypervisor. Hyper-V is the only one Microsoft has ever made. And since a Microsoft employee has written this, it is definitely about a Microsoft product. (Bonus chatter: This principle does not always hold about other company employees, even those whose competing products sell much stronger than Microsoft&#8217;s.)</p>

		<p>That would be like killing the &#8220;Idle cpu time&#8221; process</p>

		<p>As I can see in host&#8217;s task manager, CPU usage is assigned to vmmem, but RAM consumption is assigned to vmwp.exe. It doesn&#8217;t make sense for me. Why two processes per VM? One would be ideal, no?</p>

		<p>VMWP.EXE is a real process.</p>

		<p>On my machine, I see a vmmem process consuming lots of memory (1.4GB private bytes, 350MB working set), but I have no Hyper-V machines running. The process runs as &#8220;NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\{some guid}&#8221; user. I even deleted all my Hyper-V machines &#8211; still vmmem remains.</p>
<p>I presume it&#8217;s some implicit VM, like Windows Defender Application Guard uses to run Edge (and office?) &#8211; how can I determine that?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
