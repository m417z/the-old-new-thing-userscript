<p>Back in Windows&nbsp;95, there was an elusive heap corruption bug in the graphics engine, and after a lot of analysis, the graphics folks were convinced that the corruption was coming from outside their component, and they had a pretty good idea who the corruptor was, but they needed proof.</p>
<p> One of the standard techniques of narrowing down the source of a problem like this is to put a signature value in the object and validating the signature on entry to every function that uses that object as well as on exit. If you find that the signature was valid on entry but is corrupted on exit, then your function corrupted it. Conversely, if it was valid on exit but is invalid on a subsequent entry, then somebody else corrupted it. At least that's the theory. </p>
<p> The developer who was responsible for investigating the bug decided to use this "signature value" technique. It is often the case that, for throwaway temporary signatures like this, you will use your own initials as the signature value. This is partly egotism but mostly just lack of creativity. But this particular developer had a better idea. Since he had a pretty good idea which component was corrupting the memory, he used not his own initials, but the initials of the developer responsible for the component he thought was the corruptor! That way, when that developer's component corrupted the signature, it'd just be corrupting his own initials. </p>
<p> Of course, when the developer of the suspect component saw this check-in, he felt kind of insulted. After all, his friend just accused him of corrupting memory. </p>
<p> (Epilogue: It turns out that the graphics folks were right. It <i>was</i> that other component that was corrupting the memory.) </p>

		<p>Seems to me that a couple of iterations of rand() would have been equally effective while avoiding the ego problem entirely.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;ve found that validation in and out of a function has a flaw: it leads to false positives when multiple threads are involved, because the thread that caused the corruption might not exit its function before another thread detects the violation.</p>

		<p>In the Olden Days, we used to use the hex string 0xDEADBEEF. &nbsp;Very easy to spot in the hex dump. &nbsp;And if you fill unallocated memory with it, it also tends to make programs crash, when they might otherwise run happily if the stuff were filled with zeros instead.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s plenty of common ones out there including the ever popular 0xDEADBEEF (mentioned above) and 0xCAFEBABE. I guess it depends on how much space you need to fill.</p>

		<p>LOL! &nbsp;I like the CAFEBABE and BAADFOOD examples.</p>
<p>I personally use a something like ABCD1234 or 12345678 if it is easy to pick a signature out of a memory dump. &nbsp;If a bug is really annoying me though, I might encode a swearword as a string and print it out at the start and the end of the function.</p>

		<p>Those swear words. &nbsp;We had a developer who had one situation that he just couldn&#8217;t deal with, so for the time being he replaced it with a dialog that indicated in the most profane way that something was terribly wrong. &nbsp;Then, he went ahead and finished the rest of the component.</p>
<p>The problem was he forgot to check that corner condition and it made it out to a customer who happened apon that condition.</p>

		<p>On pre OSX Macs the first IIRC 512 bytes of RAM were not used because too many people were writing to it with a null pointer. There was an extension called Even Better Bus Error that would write a signature to memory location 0 and check it on every video vertical retrace. If the signature changed EBBE would generate a bus error and halt the machine. You could catch the error in MacsBug and debug the problem. It was a great tool to check to see if you messed up and had code that wrote to a null pointer.</p>
<p>People saw that it was a popular extension so they would download and install it. Immediately their machine would start &quot;crashing&quot; with a bus error. The users had no idea what the extension was supposed to do this and sent the developer tons of nasty emails saying that his extension was buggy. Of course it wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>IIRC EBBE used DEADBEEF because not only was it easy to see it was also an invalid memory address.</p>

		<p>One of the disadvantages of little-endianess is that sigs such as 0xDEADBEEF show up as EF BE AD DE in a byte dump. Or as shorts: BEEF DEAD</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ironic the practice of using 4-char tags makes it easy to see in a dump but harder to read in the source code: you write &#8216;edud&#8217; in order to find &#8216;dude&#8217; in a dump. See ExAllocPoolWithTag()</p>
<p>I sometimes use 0x11111111 because a bunch of skinny 1&#8217;s stands out among other fat chars &#8211; and obviously because it&#8217;s endian-agnostic.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
