		<p>It&#8217;s more likely it means revenue than profit. To calculate the difference in profit, you will also need to work out the difference in the cost of developing, marketing etc. Business, Home Premium and Basic. Prices alone tell you the difference in average revenue.</p>

		<p>Makes me wonder what the uplift is for the XP downgrade program. A required upgrade here for supported access to the corporate network as of the end of this month.</p>
<p>Also interesting, and annoying, that other vendors are hooking into limiting their applications according to Vista version, increasing the OS switching cost further.</p>
<p>Home use with large drives and lots of cores is looking like the first place I&#8217;ll have any (unforced) reason to want Vista.</p>

		<p>@Sunil Joshi:</p>
<p>Except, all versions of Vista are on the DVD shipped from Microsoft. That way you can do the upgrade by downloading a license key and you Vista is now magically upgraded to whatever version you purchased.</p>
<p>Snarky comment: Sorry, XP is not on the Vista DVD. Though, that&#8217;s supposed to be a freebie if you have Vista.</p>

		<p>Worf: Putting it all on one DVD saves you some manufacturing cost, but it doesn&#8217;t save you the cost of developing the business-specific features, the cost of marketing those features, or any of the other costs involved.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>If you buy a PC that comes with Vista, and upgrade it to XP, does MS still count it as a Vista sale ? They should be able to detect the upgrade from Vista to XP because they both have to be activated online. But how is this counted ?</p>

		<p>&quot;@Abhishek: I think he was trying to be funny.&quot;</p>
<p>No I wasn&#8217;t. Upgrade doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean &quot;higher version number&quot;, it could also mean (according to wiktionary): &quot;to replace an existing object with something better&quot; which perfectly fits the description of replacing Vista with XP.</p>
<p>Maybe &quot;less bad&quot; would be even more accurate. I was just wondering if the number of sales MS claims for Vista reflects the true numer of active Vista installations and not just the people who bought a Vista license because it came with the system and who used the upgrade-to-XP option. They certainly have the possibility (through the activation mechanism).</p>
<p>&quot;Put a dozen SE engineers on it and celebrate the Second Coming of Windows.&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the current Windows OS can survive for much longer, they need to restart from scratch. Windows is old, and it shows. And I don&#8217;t mean &quot;18-year-old single malt whisky old&quot; like Unix, I mean &quot;my rust-bucket of a car is falling apart on me&quot; old. The bit rot shines through in the UI and the API&#8217;s (see e.g. this blog&#8217;s archive).</p>
<p>So while I would welcome a win2k8 WS for the short term, I&#8217;m really curious to see what MS will do in the long term, breaking backwards compatibility will dissolve their user base in one go, but staying backwards compatible will make Windows slowly fade into oblivion.</p>
<p>All in all, it&#8217;s going to be an interesting decade or two :)</p>

		<p>&quot;Until there is a viable alternative, Windows is probably not going anywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>Seeing the popularity of Linux on cheap netbooks, Apple&#8217;s ever increasing market share. More and more applications moving to being webapps (== os independent). I say there are many alternatives.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
</div><br/>
