<p>Alas,
<a HREF="http://www.woot.com/offers/schrdingers-cat-carrier">
Schr&ouml;dinger's cat carrier</a> is sold out.
</p>
<p>
Is it a real product or a fake product?
Or is it both real and fake at the same time,
up until the moment you open the box and look inside?</p>

		<p>The question is irrelevant, as one cannot make statements outside the context of measurement. Hence that is also the only correct answer according to the Copenhagen Interpretation. That also means statements that it is both at the same time until measured are factual incorrect, despite it indeed often explained as such. It is actually the most commenly mistake made when discussing QM. One however cannot make ***any*** statement about actual state, outside of probabilities (unless one abandons the Copenhagen Interpretation) based on knowledge acquired from previous measurements.</p>
<p> That said, Schr√∂dinger&#8217;s himself argued that the cat probably was dead long before the box was opened provided one waited long enough. You just cannot tell for sure though, and hence shouldn&#8217;t try and claim either way.</p>
<p>Back to the joke, it therefore obviously is fake. Since it is sold out, it is unmeasurable :-)</p>

		<p>&gt;curiosity killed the cat<br />
Do you mean the cat died when someone curious decided to measure its state?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
