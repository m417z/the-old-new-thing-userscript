<p>Back in March, I agreed to make a brief appearance at <a href="http://www.techdays.pt/"> Portugal TechDays 2008</a>. My arrival was delayed due to heavy traffic: I had taken the number 15 tram, which was jam packed, and the traffic on the road didn't help either. And then when I found the building labelled <a href="http://wikimapia.org/1458221/"> <i>Centro de Congressos</i></a>, I found the doors locked. That's because the big sign facing Rua da Junqueira is not the main entrance. The main entrance faces Travessa da Guarda. But of course, when you're standing on Rua da Junqueira, you don't know that. And right next to the big sign is a door. Which is locked. And there's no sign on the door that says "You idiot, this is the side entrance. The main entrance is around the corner over there."</p>
<p> All these problems getting to (and finding the entrance to) the meeting hall meant that I had eaten into my entire scheduling buffer and even gone a few minutes over. Fortunately, we operate on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/27/8553639.aspx"> Portuguese Time</a> and people were still settling in when I rushed onto the stage. </p>
<p> The conference organizers had sent me a slide deck template. It went roughly like this: </p>
<ul>
<li>Cover page - talk title, speaker name </li>
<li>Pages labelled <i>Do not remove</i> </li>
<li>A template labelled <i>Agenda</i> </li>
<li>A place to insert the bulk of the slides. </li>
<li>Template pages labelled things like <i>Other Resources</i>,     <i>Call to Action</i>, <i>Q&amp;A</i>. </li>
<li>Pages labelled <i>Do not remove</i> </li>
</ul>
<p> My completed slide deck therefore looked like this: </p>
<ul>
<li>Cover page - talk title, speaker name </li>
<li>Pages labelled <i>Do not remove</i> </li>
<li>Agenda:     "<a href="http://agilior.pt/blogs/rodrigo.guerreiro/archive/2008/03/14/3901.aspx">Tell stories</a>". </li>
<li>Other Resources:     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/">     Michael Kaplan</a>,     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/LarryOsterman/">     Larry Osterman</a>. </li>
<li>Pages labelled <i>Do not remove</i> </li>
</ul>
<p> As a result, my slide deck consisted almost entirely of the <i>Do not remove</i> mandatory content. </p>
<p> When I was invited, the conference organizers had told me that I had a one-hour time slot and when I arrived, I asked, "So this is one hour, right?" </p>
<p> "One and a half hours" was the reply. </p>
<p> Oh, okay. Fortunately, I brought about two hours of material, so I had plenty of content to slip back in, but I had to adjust my pacing so I hit my conclusion at the right time. I also had to be elsewhere after the talk, and extending my talk by another half hour meant that it would be a tight squeeze getting to my next scheduled event on time. </p>
<p> At about the one hour mark into my talk, people started leaving. Gosh, I'm sorry my stories sucked. Maybe they were too technical, or they were not technical enough? I don't know, because people who leave early don't leave feedback. </p>
<p> I wrapped up at the 90 minute mark, got my polite applause, and packed up my things to leave. Maybe if I rushed, I could catch the 15 tram back to my hotel in time. </p>
<p> A conference organizer person asked if I could do a short interview for a Webcast. Okay, we set up the camera and the microphone, and we were rolling. The interviewer then asked questions that I obviously can't answer, like "So tell me when Windows&nbsp;7 is going to ship." I pointed out to the interviewer, "You know I can't answer that." </p>
<p> "Yes, I know but our viewers want to know." </p>
<p> As if I'm going to say, "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize. Let me talk about something I'm not authorized to talk about so your viewers won't be disappointed." </p>
<p> Fortunately, I have a standard story that I tell whenever an interviewer asks me a question I obviously am not allowed to answer. </p>
<p> The interviewer continued by asking questions that I had answered in my talk. I thought this was strange, but afterwards I realized that the people who will watch the Webcast probably didn't see my talk. After all, who wants to see me any more than necessary? </p>
<p> Each of the questions after the first two was of the form, "One last question. Blah blah blah blah?" I think there were five "last questions". </p>
<p> The interview took about a half hour, and now I had no chance of making it back to my hotel by public transit. I hailed a cab and just my luck, I got an older cabbie whose farsightedness prevented him from reading the address I had written down on a slip of paper. I was forced to try to read it to him by reverse-engineering on the fly the pronunciation rules for the Portuguese language based on what I could remember from how the station names were announced on the subway speaker system. </p>
<p> By some miracle, I was successful. </p>
<p> What my cabbie lacked in short-distance vision he more than made up for with blood pressure. He drove aggressively through the streets, liberally honking his horn at everything in his way. The pictures I took out the cab window all came out blurry. I arrived at my hotel with plenty of time to spare. </p>
<p> I glanced at the conference schedule included in my speaker ID tag. My talk was scheduled for 60&nbsp;minutes after all. That's why people were leaving. And they must think I'm a jerk for going over my time slot. </p>
<p> And I never did get my speaker shirt. </p>

		<p>What&#8217;s a good name for a site which apparently no longer works because it&#8217;s received too many visitors via Raymond? Something akin to &quot;Slashdotting&quot;.</p>

		<p>Even had your time slot been 90 minutes, people leaving on an hour boundary is typical. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t be insulted. &nbsp;They usually aren&#8217;t trying to be rude or say your talk sucked&#8211;they just have a schedule conflict.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m surprised that reporters even think that people at Microsoft know when Windows 7 is going to ship; when you&#8217;re well over a year from release there aren&#8217;t going to be any dates set in stone yet, surely?</p>

		<p>I have a friend that sometimes answers standard questions with a humorous retort. &nbsp;For questions such as &quot;How are you?&quot; or &quot;How was lunch?&quot; or &quot;How was your weekend?&quot; he will answer &quot;Terrible, but I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; used to it.&quot; &nbsp;(I am easily amused and giggle almost every time I hear this response.)</p>
<p>If I can paraphrase my friend&#8217;s answer to the Windows 7 delivery question: &quot;The firm delivery date for Windows 7 is as yet unannounced, but we&#8217;re gettin&#8217; used to it.&quot;</p>

		<p>Another vote for the &quot;standard&quot; story.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;d like a little &quot;Why the &quot;&quot; key behaves strangely under Server 2008&quot; blog entry. It&#8217;s odd, I googled it with no results. I have to press it twice in order to type &quot;, if I press it once and then certain letters, like E for example, I get a &#203;. The same is true of &#220;, &#207;, &#214;. Not sure if you&#8217;re the person to ask, but meh, figured I&#8217;d give it a shot. :)</p>

		<p>Thank you David. It makes perfect sense now.</p>
<p>&quot;The US-International keyboard layout available on Windows and the X Window System place dead keys directly on similar-looking punctuation marks.&quot;.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
