		<p>Now this is one thing I never needed to know. Or as (I think) Sherlock Holmes put it:<br />
<br />Interesting&#8230;now I hope I will forget soon. So my brain can remember important things.</p>

		<p>&quot;Why don&#8217;t you ever see a rat vomiting?&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe because I don&#8217;t want to see a rat at all, much less a rat vomiting?</p>
<p>I saw a chicken play the piano once though.</p>

		<p>Pica also shows up in pregnant women. A flyer that my wife got from her doctor listed reasons that she would need to come in to the doctor. Among them was: &quot;Eating non-food substances such as bleach and charcoal.&quot;</p>

		<p>Aha. So that&#8217;s why when they&#8217;ve eaten poison and are staggering round they don&#8217;t try to vomit it up.</p>

		<p>&quot;I&#8217;ve seen Microsoft libraries vomit though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not vomit, throw.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah.  By the way, if the owner of this blog sees the way your code abuses exceptions, &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up.&quot;</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  From the article: &quot;One of the main functions of vomiting is to purge the body of toxic substances. Rats can&#8217;t vomit, but they do have other strategies to defend themselves against toxins&#8230;  When rats discover a new food, they taste a little of it, and if it makes them sick they scrupulously avoid that food&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, the human digestive system is exception-based whereas a rat&#8217;s system uses error return codes.</p>
<p>Human:<br />
  <br />try<br />
  <br />{<br />
  <br />    while (!Full())<br />
  <br />    {<br />
  <br />        // Caution: human can throw up exceptions here<br />
  <br />        EatFoodBite();<br />
  <br />    }<br />
  <br />}<br />
  <br />catch (&#8230;)<br />
  <br />{<br />
  <br />    RunToBathroom();<br />
  <br />}</p>
<p>Rat:<br />
  <br />bool fGoodFood = true;<br />
  <br />while (fGoodFood &amp;&amp; !Full())<br />
  <br />{<br />
  <br />    fGoodFood = EatFoodBite();<br />
  <br />}</p>
<p>or, for your highly-optimized rat:<br />
  <br />while (!Full() &amp;&amp; EatFoodBite())<br />
  <br />    ;</p>
<p>Next time, we&#8217;ll examine how the introduction of additional mouths and stomachs to a rat can dramatically increase throughput, and what changes are needed to our food dispatching loop to accommodate them.  ;-)

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
