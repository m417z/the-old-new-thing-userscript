<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/m128i">
The MSDN documentation for <code>__m128i</code></a>
says
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
You should not access the <b>__m128i</b> fields directly.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What are the dire consequences of
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20141208-00/?p=43453">
accessing the fields directly</a>?
</p>
<p>
The first consequence is portability:
The contents of the <code>__m128i</code> structure are
not standardized.
It is a 16-byte value stored on a 16-byte boundary, 
but that's all that is required.
If you go digging around inside it,
you are tying yourself to a particular implementation's
definition of <code>__m128i</code>.
</p>
<p>
The other consequence is performance:
If a <code>__m128i</code> value is in an XMM register,
and you try to access a field from it,
the compiler will store the XMM register to memory,
so that it can then extract the appropriate field.
If you want to pull out specific fields,
you are better-served using an intrinsic if an
applicable one is available.</p>

		<p>And the third one is spelt on that documentation page: People running &#8220;your code using _m128i&#8221; on Pentium III will encounter silent failure (possibly because some possible compiled instruction of mov family will be the same as movdqa from the information provided? not checking how the compiled instruction of both kind of instruction looks really), so you had better not use it.</p>

		<p>Pretty much everything modern requires at least SSE2, so you&#8217;ll have other problems anyway.</p>

		<p>I believe what is technically happening is that many SSE2 instructions are MMX instructions with a prefix like 0xF3 or 0x66 that older processors silently ignore instead of treating it as an illegal opcode.</p>

		<p>I used to own Athlon 2600+ that didn&#8217;t support SSE2. About 2008, more and more games started having problems on my computer, which I eventually tracked down to SIGILL on SSE2 opcodes. I had to do some weird hacks &#8211; replace PhysX DLLs for Borderlands, remove music files from Call of Duty&#8230;</p>

		<p>Sorry for OT, but what was behind the decision not to support 80 bit long double by Microsoft compiler (MSVC)? MSVC supports long double data type, but treats them like double (= 64 bit variable). Is there any plan to support it in the future MSVS?</p>

		<p>&#8221; what was behind the decision not to support 80 bit long double by Microsoft compiler&#8221; </p>
<p>It seems like support for them was lost in the move from 16 bits to 32 bits. They&#8217;re not portable to non x86 platforms perhaps?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
