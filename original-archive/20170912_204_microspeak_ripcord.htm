<p>
Remember: General business jargon still qualifies as Microspeak
if it is in wide enough use at Microsoft that you are expected
to know what it means and how to use it.
</p>
<p>
Today's Microspeak term is <i>ripcord</i>.
A <i>ripcord</i> is an alternate, much less risky plan
which can be easily deployed at the last moment.
You can think of pulling the ripcord
as deploying an emergency parachute to prevent your project
from plummeting to its death.
</p>
<p>
You might say that the ripcord is a backup plan to ensure
that your feature
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130716-00/?p=3793">lands</a>.
You would prefer to land the plane, but if things go really bad,
you can push the eject button and yank the ripcord.
</p>
<p>
One example of a ripcord would be a compile-time <code>#ifdef</code>
that switches over to the less-risky plan.
This would allow the feature to be turned off just prior to shipping.
Another would be a runtime check against a configuration
setting which disables a risky feature.
The runtime check allows
the feature to be turned off even after you ship.
</p>
<p>
Of course, in order to be sure that your low-risk plan really is low-risk,
you need to add the ripcord to your acceptance testing!
</p>
<p>
Here are some citations:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
When releasing a feature to Insiders,
make sure you have specific <i>ripcord</i> criteria in place
for feature functionality and reliability.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In English, this means that before releasing a feature to Insiders,
make sure you have specific functionality and reliability
criteria in place to determine whether
to keep the feature or to withdraw it.
(And if you decide to withdraw the feature, make sure you have a plan
for doing so quickly and with very low risk.)
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
You can create additional security groups as a ripcord in case
the default security groups do not adequately express your needs.
We strongly recommend that you use the default security groups,
because custom security groups are more expensive on the back-end,
and they are confusing for users.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As we see above,
the term has been generalized to mean an escape hatch
to cover any unforeseen circumstances.
In this case,
creating a custom security group is not a plan
that replaces a risky option with a less risky option.
(Indeed, it's the opposite.
It's replacing a safer option with a riskier option!)
Rather, the custom security group
is an alternative that supplements the existing
default security groups in case they prove insufficient.</p>

		<p>@Michael Dunn: I inferred it&#8217;s meaning from the ripcord on an emergency parachute; that is, a parachutist would pull the ripcord on the emergency chute if the primary chute fails.  Never mind that the primary chute also has a ripcord&#8230; I think you&#8217;re supposed to associate &#8220;ripcord&#8221; with &#8220;emergency/backup chute&#8221;, and then, this Microspeak makes sense.</p>

		<p>I updated the text. Ideally, you land the plane. But if things go really bad, you can push the eject button and pull the ripcord.</p>

		<p>At my company, we call these <i>Andon cords</i>, from the manufacturing term:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andon_(manufacturing)" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andon_(manufacturing)</a></p>
<p>If we develop a risky or dangerous feature, we also develop an Andon cord to go along with it, so that if we find a problem in production, we can quickly pull the Andon cord to immediately disable the feature.</p>

		<p>So, &#8220;ripcord&#8221; = &#8220;plan B&#8221;.</p>
<p>As for your metaphor, no, nobody does that to a plane. Only <i>some</i> fighter jets have an eject button; bombers, gunships, military cargo jets, commercial airliners, private jets and even private single/twin seat planes do not have an eject button. Also, when you use the metaphorical &#8220;lands&#8221; (verb), your plane metaphor is expected to be the plane, whereas in your text, the plane is an expendable thing.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Also, when you use the metaphorical “lands” (verb), your plane metaphor is expected to be the plane&#8221;<br />
You&#8217;re misunderstanding the metaphor. The feature is the pilot not the plane. Yes the pilot would generally prefer to land (a verb used for both planes and skydivers) in the plane, but using a parachute is an acceptable alternative to crashing.</p>

		<p>Given your explanation, I&#8217;ve understood it perfectly.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t seem to understand the repercussions of what you explained: In Microsoft a &#8220;ripcord&#8221; is something that saves a project, not ditch it. In plane, a ripcord is something that is used when the pilot ditches the plane, not save it. Hence, one must only use the latter as a metaphor when the act one is explaining is the act of a member of the project saving his/her own ass while the project crashes and burns, along with everyone in it. (A project is more like an airliner with many passengers than a fighter jet.)</p>
<p>Judging by their comments, it seems Michael Dunn and morlamweb have grasped this issue pretty well.</p>

		<p>You are assuming that a lot of effort goes into refining the nuances of Microspeak. My guess is that this started as an on-the-fly metaphor in a meeting somewhere, and it started gaining traction. At no point was a linguist consulted.</p>

		<p>LOL. I assume no such thing. What I wrote was a criticism on your poor choice of convoluted simile, where you didn&#8217;t even need one. Plain text and examples with no simile (or just the initial simile) were clear enough.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
