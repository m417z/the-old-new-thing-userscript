<p>The Operations group at Microsoft manage the servers which keep the company running. And they have their own jargon which is puzzling to those of us who don't spend all our days in a noisy server room.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Unplanned Unplanned Outage</i> </li>
<li><i>Planned Unplanned Outage</i> </li>
<li><i>Immediate Deployment Timeframe</i>.     This one even has its own TLA: IDT. </li>
</ul>
<p> From what I can gather, an <i>Unplanned Outage</i> would be better termed an <i>Unscheduled Outage</i>: We did not have it marked off on our calendar that the server would be unavailable at this time, but it ended up that way. These unscheduled outages fall into two categories: An <i>Unplanned Unplanned Outage</i> is an unscheduled outage that took place of its own volition. In other words, the server crashed or somebody accidentally kicked the power cable. On the other hand, the paradoxically-named <i>Planned Unplanned Outage</i> is an unscheduled outage that took place because the operations team took the server down out of schedule. For example, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/17/91178.aspx"> the server may have started thrashing</a>, and they think rebooting it will help. </p>
<p> But the one that sounds really Microspeaky is <i>Immediate Deployment Timeframe</i>. Here's a citation: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>Date</b>: June 7, 2011 4:52 PM </p>
<p> ...<br> Due to the critical nature of this issue, the hotfix will be deployed in an Immediate Deployment Timeframe. All affected servers will be remediated on June&nbsp;8. </p>
<p> <b>Start</b>: June 7, 2011 11:00PM<br> <b>End</b>: June 8, 2011 12:00AM<br> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> In other word, <i>Immediate Deployment Timeframe</i> means <i>as soon as possible</i>. Note, however that it doesn't mean <i>now</i>, which is what I originally thought <i>immediate</i> meant until I looked at the start/end times and compared them to the message time. There must be some other TLA that means <i>now</i>, but what is faster than <i>immediate</i>? </p>
<p> <b>Bonus Microspeak</b>: remediate. </p>

		<p>•Unplanned Unplanned Outage &#8211; something unexpected happended and the server went down</p>
<p>•Planned Unplanned Outage &#8211; management said we need to give a months notice for a planned outage but we dont want to wait that long so we will give a weeks notice and call it unplanned, but it really is planned so well call it planned unplanned.</p>

		<p>&quot;There must be some other TLA that means now, but what is faster than immediate?&quot;</p>
<p>I would not put it past Microsoft (or any other large, complex corporate entity) to have a four- or five-letter acronym that means &quot;now&quot;.</p>

		<p>the airline code for &#39;now&#39; &nbsp;is &#39;at this time&#39; (&quot;at this time please turn off all electronics&quot;) so the TLA for it should be ATT</p>
<p>The problem is that the airline code for &#39;then&#39; is &#39;at that time&#39; (&quot;at that time use of electronic equipment will be permitted&quot;). The TLA for that is also ATT</p>
<p>maybe ATI and ATA as in At ThIs time and At ThAt time</p>

		<p>No, that&#39;s exactly what it means (consistent with the definition in OED from 1837). I&#39;m guessing Raymond&#39;s wish is that the &quot;perfectly good word&quot; &quot;remedy&quot; be used instead.</p>

		<p>Well, according to the rules of Magic the Gathering that were current when I was in grade 4, &quot;interrupt&quot; is faster than &quot;instant&quot;, and &quot;instant&quot; seems to match &quot;immediate&quot;. &nbsp;Therefore, Interrupt Deployment Timeframe. &nbsp;As a bonus, it keeps the same TLA, so nobody has to be bothered with the difference between now and almost now.</p>

		<p>&quot;Faster than immediate&quot; deployments IME usually are a cause of many unplanned unplanned outages, sadly enough&#8230;. &nbsp;As well, I usually am thinking of garbage dumps as the target of a remediation. &nbsp;It&#39;s an odd mental picture when servers are put in that frame.</p>

		<p>I suppose I&#39;ll be the one to ask the obvious: Why isn&#39;t it just &quot;planned/unplanned outage&quot;. The extra &quot;unplanned&quot; seems unnecessary, because it can be removed and still be logically consistent. (There are no, say, planned planned outages, or unplanned planned outages).</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Why isn&#39;t it just &quot;planned/unplanned outage&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<p>That allows only two possibilities; there are three.</p>
<p>There are planned outages &#8211; for example, to install security updates on the servers.</p>
<p>Then there are the two kinds of unplanned outages that Raymond outlines.</p>
<p>Users don&#39;t care whether an unplanned outage is planned unplanned, or unplanned unplanned. &nbsp;In fact, they usually don&#39;t even care whether an outage is planned or unplanned! &nbsp;Users just don&#39;t want outages to happen at all; and when they do happen, users want them over as soon as possible.</p>

		<p>&quot;Intentional unplanned outage&quot; would have been clearer. You can even confuse it with &quot;intentionally unplanned outage&quot;, but that&#39;s OK because it&#39;s practically the same thing &#8212; it&#39;s an outage you could have planned, but chose not to. An &quot;unintentional unplanned outage&quot; is a crash, and an &quot;unintentionally unplanned outage&quot; is when the outage was planned, really, but you forgot to update the calendar. Finally, an &quot;unintentionally planned outage&quot; is when you tried to just hit the power switch, but someone intercepted you and insisted you plan for it.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#39;s trivial to convert intentional unplanned outages to planned ones &#8212; just schedule them 20 seconds ahead of right now. Not my fault your RSS feed is slow today. If people are already used to IDT, you can call this &quot;micro-IDT&quot;. Sapir and Whorf were really on to something with this &quot;language shapes thought&quot; thing &#8212; by synergistically leveraging idioms, we can enhance the richness of our user&#39;s experiences. I got a lot of learns out of this day.</p>

		<p>If &quot;immediate&quot; means &quot;as soon as possible&quot;, then faster than that might be &quot;premature&quot;. But as far as I know nobody ever makes an announcement that something will be done too early, it&#39;s only applicable to later analysis of what went wrong.</p>

		<p>I can see the difference, but the phrasing is confusing.</p>
<p>If I was patching the SQL Server Cluster, and I took each server down in rotation and brought it back up, I could patch those servers with no downtime.</p>
<p>If, while doing so, I made a mistake or ran into a problem that resulted in downtime- I planned the change, but did not plan the downtime. Planned Unplanned Outage.</p>
<p>It might be useful as a method of tracking the causes of outages, I guess. We categorized those as &quot;Induced&quot;, and the remediation was generally Training or Process Improvement.</p>
<p>This segues into Remediation. Used to mean &quot;Correcting an existing problem&quot;, that&#39;s fine. Our company tends to use it for any change. Requirements change on the project, how do you remediate your deliverable to comply with the new requirements. Or am I too caught up in the jargon that I&#39;m missing the point?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
