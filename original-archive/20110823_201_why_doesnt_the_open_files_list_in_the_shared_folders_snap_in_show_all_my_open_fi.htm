<p>A customer wanted a way to determine which users were using specific files on their server. They fired up the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/cc770406.aspx"> Shared Folders MMC snap-in</a> and went to the <i>Open Files</i> list. They found that the results were inconsistent. Some file types like <code>.exe</code> and <code>.pdf</code> did show up in the list when they were open, but other file types like <code>.txt</code> did not. The customer asked for an explanation of the inconsistency and for a list of which file types work and which ones don't.</p>
<p> The customer is confusing two senses of the term <i>open file</i>. From the file system point of view, an open file is one that has an outstanding handle reference. This is different from the user interface concept of "There is an open window on my screen showing the contents of the file." </p>
<p> The <i>Open Files</i> list shows files which are open in the file system sense, not in the user interface sense. </p>
<p> Whether a file shows up in the <i>Open Files</i> list depends on  the application that is used to open the file (in the user interface sense). Text files are typically opened by Notepad, and Notepad reads the entire contents of the file into memory and closes the file handle. Therefore, the file is open (in the file system sense) only when it is in the process of being loaded or saved. </p>
<p> There is no comprehensive list of which types of files fall into which category because the behavior is not a function of the file type but rather a function of the application being used to view the file. (If you open a <code>.txt</code> file in Word, I believe it will keep the file system handle open until you close the document window.) </p>
<p> The customer seemed satisfied with the explanation. They ran some experiments and observed that <i>Hey, check it out, if I load a really big text file into Notepad, I can see it show up in the Open Files list momentarily</i>. They never did come back with any follow-up questions, so I don't know how they went about solving the original problem. (Maybe they used a SACL to audit who was opening the files.) </p>

		<p>I had trouble parsing this post&#39;s title &#8212; I&#39;ve never seen &quot;snap-in&quot; used as a noun before, so I kept trying to parse it as a verb and failing. &nbsp;It makes sense after thinking about it, but it&#39;s a little atypical.</p>

		<p>@Adam &#8211; it&#39;s a standard term for Microsoft Management Console. E.g. if you launch mmc (rather than a specific shortcut from Admin tools), the File menu offers &quot;Add/Remove Snap-in&#8230;&quot;.</p>

		<p>If you want to track opened files, you can download and run Process Monitor and filter it for specific file operations or file types. &nbsp;It will then log all operations and you can search through the collected log later.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also worth noting processes always have an open handle on their working directory, and Explorer windows have a directory handle open on their currently viewed directory, so those are easily viewed in Open Files at any rate.</p>

		<p>I normally find it quite annoying when apps (such as Office) maintain file handles, as this blocks anything else from opening and viewing the file. I&#39;d love to know why Office in particular does this.</p>

		<p>Never used the Microsoft Management Console. &nbsp;Even after opening it up, I can&#39;t figure out what its purpose is. &nbsp;Is it a console for managing Microsoft? &nbsp;Is it a Microsoft tool for managing consoles?† &nbsp;The UI is not instructive. &nbsp;I have to open up the Help Topics to get useful information: &quot;Microsoft Management Console (MMC) hosts administrative tools that you can use to administer networks, computers, services, and other system components.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s some menu options that open up the Device Manager, Computer Management, and Services control panels. &nbsp;Those are definitely useful, but why go through MMC to access them?</p>
<p>† Those were rhetorical questions</p>

		<p>Adam Rosenfield: Those are not control panels. They are pre-configured Microsoft Management Console instances, the list of snap-ins and extensions being stored in an .msc file. &quot;Device Manager&quot; is an .msc file (devmgmt.msc) that only references one snap-in, Device Manager.</p>
<p>The notion was to allow administrators to create their own consoles with all the tools they needed to do their jobs in one place.</p>
<p>This is a good indication of why object-oriented applications &#8211; where the user puts together an application from a collection of objects supplied by third-parties &#8211; were utterly doomed to failure. Users just don&#39;t grasp the concept.</p>

		<p>@Adam &#8230; as per Mike Dimmick. I&#39;ve found it useful and have made my own custom consoles before now; for example I can create an MMC view that includes four different event viewer snap-ins, each one looking at a different computer in a cluster. This way I can view the logs in one place rather than flip between views with Right-click -&gt; connect to computer, and the view can be saved to disk so all I need to do next time is open the view.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll note as well that Computer Management is a special snap-in that then includes other snap-ins, as from Computer Management you can get to Services and Event Viewer (amongst others), each of which are driven by their appropriate snap-in.</p>
<p>To create a custom console, when you start MMC, go to File -&gt; Add/Remove Snap-in &#8230; select the ones you want from the list, then you can just File -&gt; Save the view you&#39;ve created.</p>

		<p>There is a connected trap with Shared Folders &amp; Open Handles. I share media files on my large external USB drive over the network via SMB. Sometimes the USB drive cannot be ejected/&#39;safely removed&#39; when a media file was played recently over the network. It seems LanmanServer sometimes keeps the file handle active on a media file long after its has been served over the network (several hours) preventing the usb drive from being ejected. The only things that I found to work &#8211; restart the OS (safe) or restart the service (unsafe?).</p>

		<p>@metafonzie &#8230; That is a completely different matter. It is related to the HD write caching (delayed writing). You can set your portable device for quick removal. Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/330174" rel="nofollow">support.microsoft.com/&#8230;/330174</a> for more information.

		<p>@SimonR</p>
<p>You asked Office to open the file, didn&#39;t you? &nbsp;And you&#39;re keeping it open? &nbsp;I don&#39;t understand how you can get upset at Office for holding a handle to a file that you asked it to open and haven&#39;t closed yet.</p>
<p>Using Notepad&#39;s behavior as a baseline to compare to &quot;real&quot; programs is silly, because as everyone here should know: Notepad is just a glorified Edit control.</p>

		<p>@Ricardo C</p>
<p>Nope. I don&#39;t think so. Quick removal is irrelevant here because the problem has nothing to do with the filesystem cache. (When you manually call Eject on a USB drive, the OS flushes the cache anyway)</p>
<p>In my usecase, I get an &quot;Unable to eject, device in use&quot; kind of error because a file handle is still kept open by the lanmanserver service.</p>

<p>Ah yes the reason why Unlocker was so loved. The data corruption was why it was so hated. Too bad there&#39;s no DuplicateHandle like API that takes the wanted value of the target handle or fixing it would be easy.</p>

		<p>@Nick: So taking notepad++ or UltraEdit (haven&#39;t used it for some time but I think it did the same) as baseline isn&#39;t better? Yeah sure those are also small editors and not much more than an edit control. I&#39;m sure Visual Studio would never.. oh it does?</p>
<p>So word is pretty much the odd one out there and I personally find the other behavior nicer as well.</p>

		<p>I always found it irritating that Notepad closes the file handle. The discrepancy between files that look open on screen and files that actually are open can cause a lot of problems.</p>
<p>The most irritating one is where you open a file in Notepad, then move the file, then some time passes and you forget that you didn&#39;t reopen the file, and then you edit the file and save it and now it&#39;s back at its original location, the file at the new location is out of date &lt;i&gt;and there&#39;s nothing that tells you something went wrong.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

		<p>@Nick: Yes, I&#39;m keeping a document open, but that doesn&#39;t mean I want to block it to everything else. I often encounter situations where I want more than one app to open a file simultaneously. Writing a program that reads a file, and I want to keep it open in Office to see what it&#39;s supposed to be reading. Looking simultaneously at a raw text view and the &#39;GUI&#39; view. Or even wanting two different Word windows open, one on each monitor, to see different parts of a file. &nbsp;Anonymous Coward points out the risk &#8211; that you do something to the file and end up with it out of date etc. But surely if I know what I&#39;m doing and am prepared to take the responsibility, I should be able to? Perhaps the solution is for &#39;editors&#39; to give users a choice whether to keep a handle to the file. But then perhaps many non-dev users would find that confusing?</p>

		<p>The SBS 2003 MMC had everything you needed; as well as the Standard Management wizards it included the Active Directory Users and Computers, Group Policy Management, Computer Management, and Exchange snap-ins, plus four others I rarely used. But then SBS 2008 went back to kiddie mode, presumably for the reasons discussed above.</p>
<p>The only time I&#39;ve designed an .msc file is to allow people to be able to eject tapes remotely. (Eject buttons tend to fail.) The .msc file is configured to open directly at the appropriate drive, at which point Eject is just a right-click away.</p>

		<p>@Anonymous Coward: &nbsp;Actually I&#39;m in the opposite position, I like that it doesn&#39;t keep the handle open than it needs to. &nbsp;If there is a shared file or a file that is modified by an automated process then opening that file in an application that keeps handles open cab block others from using that file (Excel springs to mind) &#8211; I need to make sure that I keep the file open for as short a time as possible.</p>
<p>If I open the same file in Notepad I know I can keep it open as long as I like without getting in anyone elses way and without the hassle of needing to copy the file elsewhere first.</p>

		<p>@AC: Imagine if all text editors kept the files open all the time. Now let&#39;s say you are editing a file in Visual Studio. You try to compile it: “fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: &#39;.Test.cpp&#39;: Permission denied”. Try it – open a cpp file in Word and compile it. Same can happen in Notepad if let’s say you are editing a config file for some program. You can’t run the program until you close Notepad.</p>
<p>I sometimes edit CSV files with Excel, which are used by some build process. I can’t run the build until I close Excel and lose my undo history. Fail.</p>
<p>&lt;offtopic&gt; And don’t get me started on how Excel can’t open two files with the same name. What if I want to open two versions of the same file to compare them side by side or copy from one to the other? Double fail.</p>

		<p>BTW, I love it how this forum software forgets your post the first few times. Every time you retype your post it gets better and more to the point. And Ctrl+Z? That&#39;s for sissies.</p>

		<p>Ivo: The comment box times out after a few minutes. Just routinely copy your comment and refresh (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, F5), then paste your text into the fresh comment box before posting. It will always work the first time.</p>

		<p>@SimonR: keeping the file open does NOT automatically mean that other applications cannot access the file. That&#39;s what you&#39;ve got dwShareMode parameter for CreateFile for: you (i.e. the programmer) can tell the system to open the file and block other applications from opening it for read, or only from opening it for write, or even only from deleting it. And you can open the file and allow other applications to do anything with it.</p>

		<p>@Simon R. &amp;c: I just tried compiling a file that was open in Word, and it worked just fine.</p>
<p>$ g++ /j/hello.cpp</p>

<p>Hello world!</p>

		<p>@MattS: Don&#39;t assume apps set that correctly &#8211; they are well known for asking more privilege than they really require, including exclusive mode for an app that only ever reads the file.</p>

		<p>@Anonymous Coward: I suspect a lot depends on the specific software. On quick testing, once I open a c# file in word, I can still open it in Notepad, but trying to csc it fails as can&#39;t open the file, as does trying to open it in Visual Studio. &nbsp;Interestingly, the Word/VS issue is directional: I can open in Word while viewing in VS, but not the other way around. &nbsp; I&#39;m using Vista64/Word 2007/VS2008</p>

		<p>I would think that an easy fix would be a button (maybe even a hidden button) in office products that would close open file handles without closing the file. &nbsp;Office team gets their sharepoint functionality, user can lose that feature at will. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>@MattS: That&#39;s true, but most programs don&#39;t call CreateFile directly. &nbsp;They almost always go through the Microsoft C or C++ runtime, and the Microsoft implementations call CreateFile with the share mode set to exclusive. &nbsp;You have to go out of your way and write platform-specific code to call CreateFile instead (or the fopen relative _fsopen, which lets you specify a sharing mode).</p>

		<p>@Adam: people shouldn&#39;t be using _fsopen, but _wfsopen since the former doesn&#39;t support Unicode. Sure, some headers #define this for you, but you have to make sure that it happens.</p>
<p>@SimonR: opening a file in multiple editors ideally should fail, since otherwise you can get out-of-date, inconsistency and lost-edit problems. And obviously you&#39;ve found a bug in csc.exe.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
