Today's Little Program displays a context menu with a bold item.
I sort of
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/29/235737.aspx">
talked about this some time ago</a>,
but now I'm going to actually do it.
Remember, the boldface item represents the default item.
You should set it to the action that would have taken place
if the user had double-clicked the object.
</p>
<p>
Start with our
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
scratch program</a>
and make the following changes:
</p>
<pre>
void OnContextMenu(HWND hwnd, HWND hwndContext, UINT xPos, UINT yPos)
{
 HMENU hmenu = CreatePopupMenu();
 AppendMenu(hmenu, MF_STRING, 100, TEXT("&amp;First"));
 AppendMenu(hmenu, MF_STRING, 101, TEXT("&amp;Second"));
 AppendMenu(hmenu, MF_STRING, 102, TEXT("&amp;Third"));

 SetMenuDefaultItem(hmenu, 101, FALSE);

 TrackPopupMenuEx(hmenu, 0, xPos, yPos, hwnd, nullptr);

 DestroyMenu(hmenu);
}

    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_CONTEXTMENU, OnContextMenu);
</pre>
<p>
Note that for expository purposes
(this is a Little Program, after all),
I am not heeding the advice I gave
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/21/232369.aspx">
some time ago</a>.
As a result, this program does not support multiple monitors
or keyboard-invoked context menus.
Read the linked article for instructions on how to fix the code.
</p>
<p>
When you right-click on the window,
the <code>On&shy;Context&shy;Menu</code> function creates
a pop-up window,
fills it with some dummy commands,
and says that item 101 should be the default.
Then it displays the context menu to the user,
throws away the result,
and destroys the menu to avoid a memory leak.
</p>
<p>
When the menu pops up, the item <b>Second</b> appears in boldface.</p>

		<p>I probably shouldn&#39;t post this, but I have to admit that I didn&#39;t realize that there was such a thing as a default item or how to invoke it. &nbsp;Thanks for educating me.</p>

		<p>The lack of TPM_RIGHTBUTTON on context menus is really annoying. (I think Task Manager&#39;s is the one that normally annoys me.) The only one for which there is an excuse is the taskbar jump list menu, since that has its own context menu.</p>

		<p>Dear Raymond, please clarify one dark spot in the history of TrackPopupMenuEx.</p>
<p>On Win9x we can use flag TPM_SYSMENU: menu item&#39;s click causes WM_SYSCOMMAND (instead of WM_COMMAND).</p>
<p>NT bans this useful flag. </p>
<p>Why?</p>

		<p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>Would you also be able to share how you add the right-justified text for the keyboard shortcut?</p>
<p>Save &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ctrl+S</p>
<p>Print &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ctrl+P</p>

		<p>@Steve Thresher: Not sure if this is the Win32 way or just the MFC way, but placing a tab character between the main text and the accelerator text is what I&#39;ve always done.</p>

<p>To get right aligned accelerators you would use a</p>

		<p>Thanks for the suggestions ChrisR and Grenangen. I&#39;m using the Win32 function TrackPopupMenuEx() and inserting a tab character is working for me. Inserting a just gives me a square character between the menu text and accelerator text.</p>

		<p>@Steve Hmm, that&#39;s a bit odd. a works just fine from resource files for ex. Looking at a rc file of mine:</p>
<p>MENUITEM &quot;E&amp;xit aAlt+F4&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IDM_APP_EXIT</p>
<p>This gives me the expected right alignment without the side effects t will have. </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
