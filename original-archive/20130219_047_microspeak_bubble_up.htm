<p><i>Bubble up</i> is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NVY39U/?tag=tholneth-20"> the name of a soft drink</a>, but at Microsoft, it means something else. (Remember, Microspeak is not just terms used exclusively within Microsoft, but also terms used at Microsoft more often than in the general population.)</p>
<p> To <i>bubble up</i> information is to expose the information at a higher reporting level. For example, you might have a local team report that goes into detail over all the work items the team is responsible for and the corresponding status of each item. The data from this report may <i>bubble up</i> into a group report, which summarizes the work item status across all teams. </p>
<p> As another example, if there is an error condition in a particular item, the error may be reported on the status page for that item, and it may <i>bubble up</i> to the status page for the container as well (meaning that the information will be reported there, too). </p>
<p> Information can <i>bubble up</i> in other less formal ways. For example, your manager may say, "That's important. "I'll make sure to bubble that information up in our weekly status meeting," which is a jargony way of saying, "That's important. I'll make sure to present that information in our weekly status meeting." </p>
<p> The implied metaphor is bubbles rising to the surface of a liquid, with the suggestion that reaching the top of the liquid is a good thing in some way or other. (Even though people usually don't pay attention to the bubbles at the top, and once they get there, they tend to just hang around for a while, and then <i>pop</i>. A rather ignominious end to a bubble, if you ask me.) </p>
<p> The concept of information <i>flowing to higher levels</i> is used even in the HTML DOM specification: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-flow-bubbling"> Event bubbling</a> is the term used to describe how an event travels from an element to its parents. </p>

		<p>The analogy really only works for a liquid though. Like water boiling over (is that good in your organization?) or a result of shaking things up.</p>
<p>In the atmospheric model, bubbles (such as from a kid blowing bubbles from a soap solution) float down to the surface and then pop. Is there a workplace analogy for that?</p>

		<p>@Brian: &quot;In the atmospheric model, bubbles (such as from a kid blowing bubbles from a soap solution) float down to the surface and then pop. Is there a workplace analogy for that?&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s called a company vision. They float down from on high, pop on the unsuspecting workforce, and after the initial fright things continue more or less as before.</p>

		<p>Perhaps it&#39;s that the information is inefficiently sorted to the top of the organisation?</p>

		<p>I think the analogy is flawed for error conditions. This is better:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll make sure that exception rises like scum to the status page for the container&quot;</p>

		<p>If I remember correctly, the HTML DOM event bubbling came from Microsoft via IE &#8211; Netscape was doing event capturing, I think. &nbsp;So it&#39;s still a microspeak :)</p>

		<p>Bubbles rise all the way to the top, are mostly ignored until eventually they pop and just disappear entirely. So, exactly like management reports then.</p>

		<p>Though &quot;event bubbling&quot; is kinda stretching this analogy, because items are not below their parents — childrends are in front of their parents! &quot;Event nailing&quot;? Like, the event is going further into item hierarchy as a nail going farther into the wall&#8230;</p>
<p>Though again, why people don&#39;t just use &quot;to propagate&quot; or &quot;to relay&quot; is a mysterious mystery to me.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
