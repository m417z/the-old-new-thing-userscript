<p>Thanks, everybody, for coming out to the Job Fair and attending my talk at <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/"> Reflections | Projections 2009</a>. Though I should have predicted that scheduling a talk on Saturday morning means that attendance will be somewhat sparse. Thanks to <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/staff.html"> the conference staff</a> with special shout-outs to <a href="https://twitter.com/kimvlcek"> Kim Vlcek</a>, Bhargav Nookala, Jim Wordelman, and Matt Dordal for taking care of me during the conference.</p>
<p> Returning to Seattle was also a minor adventure. On my way out out of town, I stopped by Papa Del's, generally considered the benchmark for Chicago-style pizza, but they don't sell single slices for take-out, and I didn't feel like eating an entire pizza. I guess I'll have something to look forward to at my next visit. </p>
<p> For the drive back to O'Hare, I once again stopped in Bourbonnais, this time at <a href="http://www.grinderspizza.org/"> Mancino's Grinders and Pizza</a>, which appears to be another Midwestern restaurant chain, though I didn't know it at the time. My rule of thumb when traveling is "If I've heard of it, then don't eat there." Translation: Avoid the national restaurant chains; eat something local. It may be great, it may not, but it'll be different. </p>
<p> I took too long of a dinner break, and when I arrived at the airport, the ticket agent told me my flight was taking off in five minutes. I went through security (no line!) and raced through the terminal. Of course, when you're running to your gate, your gate is inevitably one at the far end of the airport. As I ran past a pair of twentysomething white guys, one of them shouted, "Run, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chink"> Chinky</a>, run!" </p>
<p> Wow, I haven't heard that epithet since elementary school. </p>
<p> Up until that point, my interactions with the fine people of Illinois were uniformly positive, and I had found them all to be unfailingly polite and helpful. I'm going to give the state the benefit of the doubt and say that the guy and his buddy were visiting from another state. (Like maybe New Jerkland or something.) </p>
<p> I arrived at the gate in time. I'm not sure, but if I wasn't the last person on the plane, I was definitely one of the last. We landed in Seattle at around midnight, but since the last train to downtown Seattle departs at 12:06am, I asked my wife to pick me up. </p>
<p> Although I caught <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/ohanian.html"> Alexis Ohanian's talk</a> (and enjoyed it), I had to leave early to catch my flight and missed <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/north.html"> Ryan North's talk</a>, which the post-conference chatter suggests was a monster hit. I'll have to wait to catch it when the <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/videos.html"> video</a> is posted. </p>
<p> <b>... until I met a man who had no feet</b>: My travel day was nothing compared to the gentleman in the seat next to me, who was in hour 25 of a 30-hour itinerary: Minsk to Kiev to Warsaw to Chicago to Seattle to Kennewick to home (the last leg by car). </p>
<p> <b>More travel day chatter</b>: The scientists on <a href="http://thepolarisproject.org/blog/"> the Polaris Project</a> have to suffer through <a href="http://thepolarisproject.org/blog/?p=238"> a four-day trek from Bellingham, WA to Cherskiy, Russia</a> even though the two cities are only 3000 miles apart. Reason: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_American_Act"> Federal regulations</a>. </p>

		<p>Finally, you emulate us!</p>
<p>My friend and I did this in Singapore airport in 2002. When we came out of immigration and started running, a couple of security people start running with us asking about our flight and calling ahead to hold it while we board. The flight took off within a minute of us getting in.</p>
<p>We were so late, they had already unloaded our luggage as a security measure (we were in 24-hour transit at Singapore, so our luggage was booked through). The checked-in luggage eventually reached us a day or two later.</p>

		<p>Whenever I&#8217;m stuck in an airport it helps to remember that when &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; was written, it was considered science fiction.</p>

		<p>My way of finding a good local restaurant depends on where I am. If I&#8217;m in my car, I use the GPS&#8217;s built-in Zagat guide. If I&#8217;m some place with Internet access, I go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.flavortownusa.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flavortownusa.com</a> to find a place nearby that has been featured on &quot;Diners, Drive-ins and Dives&quot; on the Food Network. Another good strategy is to find some place with a chef &#8212; bad restaurants don&#8217;t have chefs.</p>
<p>I also like to go places I&#8217;ve heard of but have never been to. For example, I&#8217;ve heard of Wolfgang Puck but had never been to one of his restaurants. When I was in Seattle and found out he had a cafe there, I had to try it.</p>

		<p>I have a Korean friend who played football in high school. &nbsp;He would have to remind the opposing team that he was technically a gook and not a chink. &nbsp;If you were going to insult him, at least have the brains to do it correctly. &nbsp;Kind of like Steve Martin&#8217;s rant in Roxanne.</p>

		<p>My wife and I were passing through Salt Lake City last July and overheard someone say, &quot;No chink food either&quot; as they passed a Chinese restaurant. &nbsp;We both looked at each other in shock and said, &quot;People still say that?!&quot; &nbsp;Amazing.</p>

		<p>1) Papa Del&#8217;s is the Champaign-Urbana benchmark for Chicago-style pizza, but the pizza in Chicago proper is better yet.</p>
<p>2) If I have checked luggage, I never run for a plane. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not worth it to arrive and find your luggage didn&#8217;t make it. &nbsp;(Of course for a short weekend trip, you probably just had carry on&#8230;)</p>
<p>3) Shamefully, it is completely possible that those jackasses were from the area.</p>

		<p>I love running to catch flights!</p>
<p>It happened to me once because I confused the boarding time and departure time. I was sitting in the lounge, watching TV on my laptop and drinking a Diet Coke, when suddenly I hear them calling for all passengers of the flight&#8230; I looked at my boarding pass again, then at the watch &#8211; I had one minute to cross the airport. I was late, but the plane hasn&#8217;t left and they haven&#8217;t taken out my luggage, so they hurried me on board&#8230; There was someone else who was one minute behind me. When he got on board I saw them closing the doors, and the plane quickly began to taxi, then stopped, and the captain said that we missed our scheduled departure window and since the airport is extremely busy we&#8217;ll have to wait about 40 minutes for a new one.</p>

		<p>Maybe the airlines should just stop allowing these &quot;last minute&quot; people to board the airplane.</p>
<p>If you arent at the gate on time, your bags get taken off the airplane and you aren&#8217;t allowed to fly period.</p>

		<p>I was disappointed in the Chicago pizza I had at Papa Del&#8217;s. &nbsp;And I like pizza. &nbsp;It just seemed too thick and undercooked.</p>
<p>Chez Panisse, Alice Waters&#8217; restaurant in Berkeley, makes a good pizza and a great calzone. &nbsp;But it&#8217;s entirely different than Chicago pizza. &nbsp;(And when you go to Chez Panisse for the first time, there are better things to order from there than pizza.)</p>

Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
