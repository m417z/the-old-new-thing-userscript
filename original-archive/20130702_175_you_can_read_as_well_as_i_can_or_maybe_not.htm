Occasionally, somebody will ask for help on a distribution list,
and it turns into a really annoying case of hand-holding.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: X
</p>
<p>
I'm using the XYZ toolset to do some document management,
and I want the server to run a script whenever somebody tries to
modify the master template,
so it can run validations before accepting the update,
such as verifying that the person making the change has
received the proper approvals.
Is that possible?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It turns out that this is something the XYZ toolset already
knows how to do.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: Raymond
</p>
<p>
You can create a <code>conditions</code> configuration file
which adds a condition that validates that the request
satisfies whatever conditions you require.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: X
</p>
<p>
Yes, that is what I am looking for.
Where can I find information on how to write the validation
script and how to implement it on the server?
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: Raymond
</p>
<p>
On http://xyztoolset/, go to <i>Server setup</i>,
then <i>Conditions</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another colleague with a lot of experience with the XYZ toolset
stepped in with some more useful advice:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: A
</p>
<p>
Instead of developing scripts from scratch, you may want to
start with the pre-written scripts that come with the XYZ toolset
add-on pack.
There are already modules for things like scanning the
<i>Description</i> field for approval IDs.
Note also that you may want to include some way of changing
the rules dynamically as your processes change
(for example, maybe one of the approvers goes on vacation and
delegates approval authority to somebody else,
or maybe your project goes into a "no approval necessary" phase)
rather than just hard-coding the rules.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: X
</p>
<p>
That's a good idea.
Is there a way to easily disable a validation script?
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: Raymond
</p>
<p>
Um, you can just
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/08/04/9856634.aspx">
build this into your validation script</a>.
</p>
<pre>
if (File.Exists(@"\\project\admin\no_validation")) {
   return Validation.Passed;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: A
</p>
<p>
Or you can have a magic word in the <i>Description</i> that
disables validation.
Features like this and the one Raymond describes are available
in the add-on pack.
Look in the <code>Sentinel</code> and <code>Description&shy;Match</code>
modules.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: X
</p>
<p>
I'm having trouble getting this working.
The documentation says I should do something like
</p>
<pre>
&lt;condition file="$\path\to\file.ext"
           action="C:\path\to\validate.xyz" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
If I use a shared network path for my validation script,
I get "access denied".
</p>
<pre>
&lt;condition file="$\Nosebleed\MasterTemplate.xml"
           action="\\project\admin\validate.xyz" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
If I use an internal path:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;condition file="$\Nosebleed\MasterTemplate.xml"
           action="$\Scripts\validate.xyz" &gt;
</pre>
<p>
I get "file not found".
I added $\Scripts\validate.xyz to the document repository,
so the server should be able to see it.
Am I missing something obvious here?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(I like how this person just made up a feature,
in this case, using a repository path as an action
rather than a physical file path.)
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: Raymond
</p>
<p>
My psychic powers tell me that the account under which the
server is running does not have access to
<code>\\project\<wbr>admin\<wbr>validate.xyz</code>.
And adding the validation script to the document repository
allows the server to access it only if <i>the server
has an active (and up-to-date) workspace joined to the repository</i>.
Sure the server has a copy of validate.xyz, but that copy
is in the repository <i>database</i>.
(Adding a file to the repository is more than just a "copy" operation.)
</p>
<p>
I would not be surprised if having the server also maintain
a live workspace in itself is not a recommended practice.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: X
</p>
<p>
I agree with your assessment of the "access denied" issue,
but I really don't want the validate.xyz script to reside
on an external share.
Where is the best place to put the script?
On the server or a share?
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: Raymond
</p>
<p>
The documentation for the XYZ add-on pack recommends
putting the scripts on the server,
accessible via a share.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: X
</p>
<p>
But that's what I did, and the result was "access denied."
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: Raymond
</p>
<p>
No, that's not what you did.
The recommendation is to put the scripts on the server
(C:\Scripts\validate.xyz) and then share out your scripts
(net share Scripts=C:\Scripts) so administrators can update
them remotely.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: X
</p>
<p>
I read the XYZ Toolkit documentation for <code>conditions</code>,
and it says
"Get an IT-managed share created."
I suppose I need to contact the IT department to have that done.
Correct?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
At this point, I got tired of hand-holding.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: Raymond
</p>
<p>
You can read just as well as I can.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Privately, I sent a message to <i>A</i>:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: Raymond<br>
<b>To</b>: A<br>
</p>
<blockquote STYLE="border-left: solid black .75pt; padding-left: 1em"><p>
You can read just as well as I can.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Actually, that statement is a lie.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
My colleague "A" replied,
"Yes, I thought that to myself when you used that line last week, too!"</p>

		<p>Even if it was an actual customer that wouldn&#39;t change the fact that they were a lazy ass.

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
