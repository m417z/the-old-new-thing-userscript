<p>A customer wanted to know what it means when the <code>Load&shy;Library</code> function returns the special value <code>0x10000000</code>.</p>
<p> Um, it means that the library was loaded at <code>0x10000000</code>? </p>
<p> Okay, here's some more information: "We're trying to debug an application which loads DLLs and attempts to hook their registry accesses when they call <code>Dll&shy;Register&shy;Server</code>. It looks like when the special handle is returned from <code>Load&shy;Library</code>, the registry writes go through and bypass the hook. On the other hand, when a normal value is returned by <code>Load&shy;Library</code>, the hook works." </p>
<p> There is nothing special about the value <code>0x10000000</code>. It's an address like any other address. </p>
<p> At this point, your psychic powers might start tingling. Everybody who does Win32 programming should recognize that <code>0x10000000</code> is the default DLL base address assigned by the linker. If you don't specify a custom base address, the linker will base you at <code>0x10000000</code>. </p>
<p> Now things are starting to make sense. The DLL being monitored was probably built with the default base address. The value <code>0x10000000</code> is special not because of its numeric value, but because it matches the DLL's preferred address, which means that no rebasing has occurred. And this in turn suggests that there's a bug in the registry hooks if the DLL is loaded at its preferred address. </p>
<p> The code in question was copied from a book, so now they get to debug code copied from a book. </p>
<p> Wait, we're not finished yet. </p>
<p> You may have answered the customer's question, but you haven't <i>solved their problem</i>. </p>
<p> Hooking and patching DLLs like this is not supported. But what <i>is</i> supported is the <code>Reg&shy;Override&shy;Predef&shy;Key</code> function. In fact, the <code>Reg&shy;Override&shy;Predef&shy;Key</code> was designed <i>specifically to solve this very problem</i>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The <b>Reg&shy;Override&shy;Predef&shy;Key</b> function is intended for software installation programs. It allows them to remap a predefined key, load a DLL component that will be installed on the system, call an entry point in the DLL, and examine the changes to the registry that the component attempted to make. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The documentation continues, explaining how such an installation program might use the <code>Reg&shy;Override&shy;Predef&shy;Key</code> function to accomplish the desired task. </p>

		<p>The danger with RegOverridePredefKey is, as Mike notes, that it changes the registry environment that the target is expecting. &nbsp;In my own experience, we ran into this problem using the WiX tool heat to extract SelfReg data: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://marc.durdin.net/2009/12/case-of-hidden-exception.html" rel="nofollow">marc.durdin.net/&#8230;/case-of-hidden-exception.html</a></p>
<p>@Maurits: I am guessing Mike retyped RegOverridePredefKey instead of copying and pasting&#8230;</p>

		<p>Mike: That kind of issue can be infuriating; I&#39;ve had quite a few &quot;fun&quot; debugging sessions trying to get various applications to run without Admin permissions on our shared student lab machines &#8211; then the added complication of mandatory user profiles. One tried to ensure only one copy was running at a time by creating a lockfile in the root of C &#8230; another felt the need to install itself each time it was run, by copying a few components into c:Windows. The automatic redirection stuff proved very useful when we finally managed to move to Windows 7.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve even had broken installers mangle the file association for .exe files, so running any application from the shell failed. That was &#8230; interesting.</p>
<p>Good to know about RegÂ­OverrideÂ­PredefÂ­Key though; as an alternative route, aren&#39;t the filtering techniques the Sysinternals regmon (now part of procmon) tool used more robust? (I was quite fond of one free snapshot tool, but it used a &#39;brute force&#39; approach of dumping the whole registry before and after, then comparing.)</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=Reg%C2%ADOverride%C2%ADPredef%C2%ADKey&amp;form=IE8SRC&amp;src=IE-SearchBox" rel="nofollow">http://www.bing.com/search</a></p>
<p>Trying to reverse engineer what a DLL writes to the registry is a very bad practice. I&#39;ve seen components fail to write *everything* they need when presented with an empty key. I&#39;ve also seen other components writing absolutely everything they could possibly need including things they don&#39;t own and should never touch (e.g. standard Automation registry keys).</p>

		<p>This comment needs to be put in a more accurate context &#8211; &quot;Everybody who does Win32 programming should recognize that 0x10000000 is the default DLL base address assigned by the linker&quot;. Are you referring to the Visual Studio linker? Any particular version? It&#39;s obviously not true, let alone evident to everybody who does Win32 programming, in general. For example, I am using Delphi 7 and it appears to be 0x400000 (or as they like to call it, $00400000).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
