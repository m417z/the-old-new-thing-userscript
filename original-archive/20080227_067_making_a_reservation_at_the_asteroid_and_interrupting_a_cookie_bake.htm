<p>Some months ago, I wanted to make a reservation at my favorite Seattle restaurant for special occasions: the  <a href="http://www.asteroidcafe.com/"> Asteroid Cafe</a>. (Asteroid trivia: Their original Wallingford location was so small, you had to go into the kitchen to use the rest room. When they moved to Fremont, they made a special point of putting the rest room in the kitchen for old times' sake.)</p>
<p> One evening, I called to make a reservation, and since they aren't open on Sundays, I was taken off guard when a live human being answered. I said that I was expecting the answering machine since I thought they were closed. The person who answered explained, "Well, we <i>are</i> closed. I'm not really supposed to be here. I'm just baking some cookies." And then he took my reservation. </p>
<p> I'm assuming he actually works there and wasn't some guy who broke into the restaurant to bake cookies. </p>

		<p>I always break into other people&#8217;s kitchens to bake cookies. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t you? &nbsp;Otherwise, you have to clean up your own mess.</p>

<p>Is that more or less rude than going into the kitchen to use the rest room?</p>

		<p>I actually don&#8217;t much care for the Asteroid&#8217;s new location. &nbsp;Once upon a time they were my top three favorite restaurants in Seattle, but something changed in the move, but what I can&#8217;t put my what. &nbsp;They lost their coziness, and the food no longer matches the ambiance.</p>
<p>Oh well. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve since found at least one other italian place in Seattle that I find just as satisfying as the &#8216;roid, and it&#8217;s closer to home&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
