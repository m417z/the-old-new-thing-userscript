<p>  The law was originally passed under pressure from the temperance  movement who opposed "free pour" because it created the opportunity  for bartenders to "sweeten" a drink.  By requiring the liquor to  come from a fixed-sized bottle, portion sizes could be kept under  control.  </p>
<p>  This worked great for a while.  But then social pressures shifted and  economics started happening.  Across the country, the typical size of an alcoholic beverage  started shrinking. But South Carolina's drink size stayed the same,  because the size was mandated by law.  The result: absurdly huge drinks, like the Long Island Iced Tea  that comes in a pitcher.  South Carolina ended up with the stiffest drinks in the  country, exactly the opposite of what the original drafters intended!  </p>

<p>  The effort to repeal the law has been going on for many years,  but somehow it always falls short.  Maybe this year...  </p>

		<p>Glass is easily recyclable so it shouldn&#8217;t be a problem. The bottle tops are another matter though.</p>

		<p>Why not use the UK solution. Alcholic drinks must, by law, be poured in standard measures. For beer, that means pint glasses either designed to be filled up to the brim, or with a marked &#8216;pint&#8217; line on them. For hard liquor that means poured using standard sized shot measures, either using a measuring cup or (more frequently) via a device attached to the bottle which dispenses the required amount each time it&#8217;s used. This keeps the idea of a standard measure (which could be varied by law over time if required), but eliminates the hassle and extra garbage generated by separate mini-bottles.</p>
<p>The standard measures help pubs and bars to track their costs more easily, and it means that customers know how much alcohol they are getting. Customers are protected both ways &#8211; they won&#8217;t get ripped off with a short pour, and they won&#8217;t get an unexpectedly or deceptively stiff drink. It also means there is more sense in asking for doubles.</p>

		<p>Tony: Because then South Carolina would end up like Utah, and no one outside of Utah wants to be like Utah.</p>
<p>Utah uses a elctro-mechanical dispenser system on bottle tops to control the exact amount of alcohol in each drink, and there can only be a certain amount in any drink.  2.5 ounces I think, which means many mixed drinks are either tiny, or simply can&#8217;t be served.</p>

		<p>Ben,</p>
<p>Do your research before you open your mouth please. I have worked for BFI for a number of years. We put glass in the landfill. Glass is too heavy to process in a cost effective manner and almost all of it ends up in landfill. Virgin plastic is still much cheaper than recycled glass. Some is used for road base at the landfill, but 95 percent goes to fill. Dumbass.</p>

<p>Maybe you should have done some research into this blog and found out that the tone of discussion here is usually a little more polite.</p>
<p>&quot;Glass is too heavy to process in a cost effective manner and almost all of it ends up in landfill.&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s true where you are.  I see that transportation costs can make it uneconomic.  However, if the mini-bottles are only needed in South Carolina surely they should be made there, so the glass waste would not need to go so far. Besides which, since they&#8217;re apparently a standard size it might well be possible to reuse them (after washing) rather than recycling them.<br /></p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think glass varies by density across the country, Ben Hutchings.</p>
<p>They still use mini-bottles on airplanes and they are sold in Georgia, and probably other states, for those who like to smuggle liquor into their favorite collegiate sporting events.</p>
<p>If recycling is so effective, then why do municipalities have to coerce citizens to recycle?  Why don&#8217;t municipalities pay the citizen for recyclables that they want to recycle and charge the recycling company for all of that recycled material they collected for them?</p>
<p>Because there is no market for it.</p>
<p>Why is there no market for it?</p>
<p>Because it is not scarce.</p>
<p>Why isn&#8217;t it scarce?</p>
<p>Because there is plenty of glass factories and silica to make those cute little bottles.</p>
<p>And it continues to be cheaper to just throw it away.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
