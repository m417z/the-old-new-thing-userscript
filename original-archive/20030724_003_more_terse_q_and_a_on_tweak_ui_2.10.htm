I'm going to try to alternate between programming entries (where I actually try to     teach something) and random entries (where I get to spout off or go into storytelling     mode). So here's another random entry.      </p>
<dl>
<dt>
<p>             Why does Tweak UI put up a totally incomprehensible error message ("Cannot locate             entrypoint GetDllDirectoryW in Kernel32.dll") when I try to run it on an unsupported             OS?          </p>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>                 To make sure there is absolutely no way of running it on an unsupported OS.&nbsp;                 From experience, I've learned that people would run Tweak UI on a toaster if they                 could. If I used a simple runtime check, somebody would just override it. So instead                 I made the dependency on Windows XP SP1 and Windows Server 2003 so strong that no                 amount of patching would get it to work, because the block is being done by the OS                 program loader.&nbsp; Not a single byte of Tweak UI has even run at this point, so                 you can NOP out anything you like, it won't get the program to run.              </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<p>                 Tweak UI has a bad default for the X-Mouse autoraise delay.              </p>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>                     Remember, Tweak UI merely provides an interface to existing functionality. I can't                     go changing the defaults; the defaults aren't mine to change. (In this case, the default                     comes from SystemParametersInfo(SPI_GETACTIVEWNDTRKTIMEOUT).)                  </p>

		<p>There&#8217;s always the &#8216;change the name of the imported DLL&#8217; trick, and supply a DLL which simply passes through onto the system DLLs.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t CAP do this (change KERNEL32.DLL to FERNEL32.DLL in the import directory)? Or am I thinking of a different tool?</p>

		<p>I ran TweakUI once on my blender&#8230; I never could get it to load on my Toaster. :(</p>
<p>Oh, and I really like reading your trivia. Thanks for the laughs :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
