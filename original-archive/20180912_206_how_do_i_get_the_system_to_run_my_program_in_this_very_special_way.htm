<p>
A customer registered their program to be run automatically
under conditions not important to the story.
They found, however, that the program didn't work because
the program was written with an application framework that
looks for configuration files in the current directory,
but the system wasn't setting the current directory properly.
They couldn't change the directory in their program because
the code that looks for the configuration file is in the
framework, and it runs before any of their code does.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and I forgot to mention that
mention that the
<a HREF="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Fizzbin"><code>FIZZBIN</code></a>
environment
variable needs to be set to
<code>KRONK</code>,
except on Tuesdays,
in which case it needs to be
<code>SHRONK</code>.
<a HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DeIExLcURQ">
Except at night</a>.
</p>
<p>
Okay, maybe the customer's requirements weren't that weird,
but you get the idea.
</p>
<p>
You can't get the system to do all these things for you,
but you don't have to.
</p>
<p>
Write a helper program and register the helper with the system.
The helper program sets the current directory,
sets the <code>FIZZBIN</code> environment variable,
does all the fancy preliminary nonsense your precious
program requires,
and then launches the real program.
</p>
<p>
Bingo, your current directory, environment variable,
and favorite teddy bear are all set up waiting for you.</p>

		<p>Uh that was a bit&#8230; underwhelming. This is done routinely by anybody doing sysadmin-like work, how could the customer be so helpless to require help straight from Microsoft from something so trivial?</p>

		<p>It probably involves some stuff about the start menu and quite possibly application pinning. We still have our .NET framework app that if you pin it it doesn&#8217;t start. The WinForms library doesn&#8217;t have any methods at all to change the pin launch data.</p>

		<p>FYI, there are a lot of questions in MSDN forums that ask for &#8220;best practice&#8221; of doing something trival (or not).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22best+practice%22+site%3Asocial.msdn.microsoft.com&#038;oq=%22best+practice%22+site%3Asocial.msdn.microsoft.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/search?q=%22best+practice%22+site%3Asocial.msdn.microsoft.com&#038;oq=%22best+practice%22+site%3Asocial.msdn.microsoft.com</a></p>
<p>Not necessarily because they&#8217;re newbie or too lazy to figure out, but sometimes the overhelming number of ways avaliable makes you wonder which one is the best, and sometime it&#8217;s because the subject is too trival that someone may already have builtin way to do so.</p>

		<p>Try search for &#8220;best practice&#8221; on MSDN forums.</p>
<p>Sometimes there&#8217;s overhelming number of ways to do &#8220;trival&#8221; things so you wonder what is best, other time you found something too trival that problem someone has written builtin way to do it.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s too simple. The Right Way would be to binary edit the framework&#8217;s DLL (or the main executable if it&#8217;s static linked) to change the import of KERNEL32.DLL to something like FIZZKRNL.DLL, which is a DLL which forwards everything to the real KERNEL32.DLL except when it&#8217;s one of the CreateFile calls looking for the configuration files, in which case it replaces the passed file name on the fly, or when it&#8217;s a GetEnvironmentVariable looking for FIZZBIN, in which case it returns the correct value directly.</p>
<p>(Yes, I did have to do something like that once. No, a helper program wouldn&#8217;t have helped in that particular case.)</p>

		<p>This is probably the only scenario where <code>exec</code> becomes useful, because then the helper program doesn&#8217;t require any additional assumptions. (If the calling and called programs are well written then they won&#8217;t mind an interposed helper program but you can&#8217;t always rely on that.)</p>

		<p>I remember doing this kind of helper for a game that tended to randomly crash on multicore processors. A simple call to SetProcessAffinityMask() before launching the program&#8230; (or, well, Process.GetCurrentProcess().ProcessorAffinity, since that computer didn&#8217;t have an IDE but did have the .Net Framework installed)</p>

		<p>This works for simple autostart entries but won&#8217;t work for services. Let&#8217;s say you have myservice.exe launched via the service control manager (with a ServiceMain entry point). If you change the service configuration to start a different binary which configures the &#8216;special requirements&#8217; then proceeds to CreateProcess myservice.exe and exit then Windows spews event id 7039 in the event log and terminates the service.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
