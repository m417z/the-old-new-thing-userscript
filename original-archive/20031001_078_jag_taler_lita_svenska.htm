<p>         Attended my first formal Swedish lesson last night. It's great to recapture the simultaneous         thrill and frustration of trying to have a conversation in a language you don't really         know.      </p>
<p>         It's a small class - Swedish isn't exactly one of the "big-name" languages out there.         I always feel sorry for the student who can't seem to shake the bad American accent.         I remember in high school, we had a student who spoke German with a thick Midwestern         accent. It was painful to listen to.      </p>
<p>         I thought it was just me, but it seems to be a common trait: When people are learning         their third language and they get stuck, they instinctively fall back, not on their         first language, but on their second. For me, it means that when I can't find the Swedish         word for something, I substitute the German word. One of my classmates falls back         on Spanish. (Technically, German isn't my second language, but I never got very good         at the other language before German, so German acts as the de-facto second language.)      </p>
<p> I'm pretty sure nobody finds this fascinating aside from me... </body></p>

		<p>What I find fascinating is that Swedish is an actual language.  I always thought &quot;Swedish&quot; was simply English with elongated vowel sounds and the occassional &quot;bork bork bork&quot; tossed in for good measure.</p>
<p>Learn something new everyday, I guess!</p>

		<p>It happens with me, as well.  I&#8217;m idly attempting to learn Japanese, and occaisonally when I&#8217;m trying to create sentences that I absolutely do not have the vocabulary for, I end up substituting a Spanish word.  The way I characterize it is my brain is in &quot;Foreign Language&quot; mode.  And for me, &quot;Foreign Language&quot; mode is synonymous with &quot;Spanish Mode&quot; because there really hasn&#8217;t been any other state that fits in FL mode, therefore by default I grab a Spanish word.  I don&#8217;t pick an English word because FL mode has long been established as different from &quot;Native Language&quot; mode &#8212; I&#8217;m not allowed to draw from NL mode in FL mode except in extreme cases.</p>
<p>Also, Japanese has the same vowel sounds as Spanish, so there&#8217;s that.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m amazed, and humbled, that you want to learn Swedish (of all languages)! What made you decide to learn it?</p>
<p>Anyway, you swapped &#8216;e&#8217; with &#8216;a&#8217;, it&#8217;s spelt &quot;Jag talar lite svenska.&quot; (I speak some Swedish.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a useful online dictionary you can use (ENG-SWE/SWE-ENG): <a href="http://www-lexikon.nada.kth.se/skolverket/swe-eng.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www-lexikon.nada.kth.se/skolverket/swe-eng.shtml</a></p>
<p>If you want a more complete dictionary, I suggest you buy WordFinder 7 from <a href="http://www.wordfinder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wordfinder.com/</a> &#8211; It&#8217;s simply great.</p>
<p>Till slut kanske jag kan skriva p&#229; svenska h&#228;r! :) Good luck!</p>

		<p>Actually, the substitution seems to happen with a word in the language &quot;one level up&quot;&#8230; my third language is German (approximately), but I had some Russian in high school, so when I now try to learn Japanese, I substitute with the appropriate Russian word without thinking :) It&#8217;s a mess&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m currently taking Spanish lessons, but when I can&#8217;t figure out the word I don&#8217;t substitute it with my second language (english), but with french (which I don&#8217;t speak at all!). Only because spanish looks like weird french to me.</p>

		<p>I found that this doesn&#8217;t happen just for words, but for pronunciation as well. I studied German for a year in college, but I tended to speak it with a Spanish accent.</p>

		<p>I do that with German and Japanese &#8211; I try to say a sentence in German and end it in Japanese. Very odd, since it happens so smoothly.</p>

		<p>My languages go like this:<br />
Native &#8211; English; 2nd &#8211; French (several years); 3rd &#8211; Mandarin (1 year)<br />
French and Mandarin are obviously very different, but whilst I was actively studying Mandarin, I found it really hard to speak French without the Mandarin words interjecting themselves.  Like, I would want to say &quot;Donnez-moi ce livre&quot; but what came out was &quot;Donnez-moi ce shu&quot;. ;)  Like Joe said earlier, every non-English language got thrown together in my brain&#8217;s &quot;Foreign Language Mode&quot;<br />
And now when I try to speak Spanish, I find myself saying it with a French accent. Weird.</p>

		<p>Don&#8217;t worry about substituting Swedish words with German ones, the languages are actually rather close. Due to the great German influence during the medieval ages about a third of the words in Swedish are lended from German.</p>
<p>This differentiates Swedish somewhat from the other Scandinavian languages. For example, &#8216;f&#246;nster&#8217; in Swedish is taken from the German word &#8216;Fenster&#8217;, whereas the Norwegian word is &#8216;vind&#246;ye&#8217; (wind-eye) which has become &#8216;window&#8217; in English.</p>
<p>Most of the everyday words in the Germanic languages (German, English, Dutch, Danish, Icelandish, Norwegian, Swedish, ..) share the etymology though. For example the word &#8216;hand&#8217; is (almost) the same in all the languages. Other examples I can think of are &#8216;foot&#8217;/&#8217;fot&#8217;, &#8216;apple&#8217;/&#8217;&#228;pple&#8217;, &#8216;glass&#8217;/&#8217;glas&#8217;, &#8216;bed&#8217;/&#8217;b&#228;dd&#8217;, &#8216;lamp&#8217;/&#8217;lampa&#8217;.</p>

		<p>I find this very fascinating. My languages are Swedish, English, Thai, German and Mandarin (very limited yet). And my de-facto fallback language is Thai. It was actually quite funny (well for me it was embarassing) when I was in France at the end of this summer and was able to understand some French, but not knowing how to respond, I sometimes out of reflex answered in Thai.<br />
So please keep writing about your encounters with Swedish. I find it very interesting (and not only because I&#8217;m Swedish).</p>

		<p>I find it interesting.  I notice whenver I couldn&#8217;t remember a word in Mandarin (my 3rd language), I&#8217;d fall back on Russian (my 2nd) rather than English.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
