<p>Commenter <a href="http://xenon.arcticus.com"> Chris 'Xenon' Hanson</a> points out that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#1612950"> fiddling with the <code>WS_<wbr>DISABLED</wbr></code> style directly via <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Long</code> leads to strange behavior</a>. However it isn't the case that "most widget classes work fine." Reaching in and fiddling the style bit directly is like reaching into a program's internal variables and just changing the values: All the other work that is associated with changing the value simply doesn't happen.</p>
<p> It's like taking a book you checked out of the library, re-shelving it, and then going into the library computer and marking it as "returned". The bookkeeping will say that the book has been returned, but all the other processes associated with a book return has not taken place: People who had placed a hold on the book aren't notified. The "number of books checked out" counter isn't updated. (Which gets interesting when you come to the end of your senior year and the system won't let you graduate because its records say that you still have 1 book outstanding, yet when you say "Show me all the books I have checked out" it returns no records.) </p>
<p> In the case of windows, merely setting the <code>WS_<wbr>DISABLED</wbr></code> style does not generate <code>WM_<wbr>ENABLE</wbr></code> messages, it doesn't generate accessibility notifications, it doesn't do focus bookkeeping, all it does is set the flag and goes home. Eventually, some code will stop working because something "impossible" happened (in this case, a window transitioning from enabled to disabled without ever receiving a <code>WM_<wbr>ENABLE</wbr></code> message). </p>
<p> Similarly, the way to change a window's visible state is to use the <code>Show&shy;Window</code> function and not to manipulate the <code>WS_<wbr>VISIBLE</wbr></code> style directly. </p>
<p> "I think I filed a suggestion on MSDN2.microsoft.com's suggestion box to advise people not to fiddle with the <code>WS_<wbr>DISABLED</wbr></code> flag at runtime via <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Long()</code> since it seems like a viable route if you don't know otherwise." </p>
<p> Actually, the advice already exists right at the top of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms632600.aspx"> Window Styles</a> page where it  says "After the control has been created, these styles cannot be modified, except as noted." And for <code>WS_<wbr>DISABLED</wbr></code>, it says "To change this after a window has been created, use <code>Enable&shy;Window</code>." </p>

		<p>Hmm.. the linked Window Styles page says &quot;After the window has been created, these styles cannot be modified, except as noted.&quot; &#8211; for most styles including border &amp; caption there is no notice.</p>
<p>However the documentation of SetWindowPos flag SWP_FRAMECHANGED seems to indicate you are allowed to change them: &quot;Applies new frame styles set using the SetWindowLong function.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen code fiddling with the frame/caption styles to go fullscreen and back, now I wonder if thats allowed or if the window needs to be recreated.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m sorry, but this is just bad design. &nbsp;It is equivalent to having a class with public fields that the documentation says you aren&#39;t supposed to change. &nbsp;If they aren&#39;t supposed to be fiddled with directly, make them private and have accessor methods or some other type of method that will change them and do all the other bits that need doing. &nbsp;The API should tell you what you can and can&#39;t do, not the documentation.</p>
<p>Perhaps MS should generate a message when specific styles are changed in SetWindowLong()? &nbsp;Then it could still have the encapsulation failure, but it would be mitigated. &nbsp;Kind of like how x86 CPUs implicitly do things when certain bits in eflags are changed.</p>

		<p>Wow. I&#39;m nanofamous for 15 picoseconds.</p>
<p>In my defense, I&#39;ll only say that there&#39;s a crapload of example code out there, much of it published by Microsoft in the early days, that horks around with window style bit directly. Also, a lot of things that are implemented by Windows styles don&#39;t have a wrapper function, or the wrapper function was added in a later binary API, meaning if you want to manipulate bit X in an executable that&#39;s compiled to run on API prior to the introduction of X&#39;s wrapper API, the only way to do it is via twiddling the X bit directly. And, a lot of times, this is fine. But sometimes it&#39;s not.</p>
<p>As many other posters have noted, if everyone had to do it all over again, using SetWindowLong to change style bits would never have been done. But that can be said about a lot of things in Windows, and many other OSes and APIs as well. I&#39;m just here as a cautionary tale.</p>

<p>Which comes back to the old design heuristic: &quot;don&#39;t cache information you can regenerate easily because then you risk it getting out of sync&quot;, which is closely related to normal forms in database design, the &quot;don&#39;t repeat yourself&quot; adage of object-oriented design, and so on&#8230;</p>

<p>How would you achieve this, given that you need to have a C-compatible API as a basic design requirement?</p>

		<p>@Jules:</p>
<p>&quot;How would you achieve this, given that you need to have a C-compatible API as a basic design requirement?&quot;</p>
<p>Same way you always do, and the same way COM works when using C, by passing the object an argument to the function (which is all C++ really does under the covers anyway).</p>
<p>(Passing it as an opaque handle if you want to discourage people seeing/touching the internals.)</p>
<p>Of course, the API already works that way using HWNDs and we don&#39;t set the style bits directly (we tell SetWindowLong to set them), nor do we even know where they are in memory. The issue people are criticising is that the API exposes those bits in a poor way (though it was probably a good idea at the time).</p>

<p>True. But take into account that GetWindowLong() and SetWindowLong() have been there from the times of Windows 1.01. Which ran in a 8086 with 256 KB of RAM. In the times where programmers were trusted not to be stupid.</p>
<p>The current specification reduces the implementation of GetWindowLong to a single line of code (something like WindowDataByHandle(hWnd)-&gt;WindowAttributes[nIndex] = dwNewLong; ). The implementation you propose would involve a finite number of Get/Set functions, to handle each of the bits that can be modified. And this should be implemented for each window class that define custom style bits (PBS_MARQUEE comes to mind). So &quot;finite&quot; would probably mean several dozens (or even hundreds) of APIs.</p>
<p>You choose: 25 bytes of object code, or a few KB. When you are running in 256 KB, the choice is clear.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen Raymond make such comments before &#8211; but I think it less a matter of trust, and more that things were so difficult that if you could accomplish anything, you were probably already not stupid.</p>

		<p>&quot;Reaching in and fiddling the style bit directly is like reaching into a program&#39;s internal variables and just changing the values&quot;</p>
<p>You mean, apart from the fact that he&#39;s calling a public API function with a publicly defined parameter, and the function is returning and saying &quot;yes, that&#39;s all OK&quot;? If he was actually calculating offsets to struct pointers, or walking the stack, to find memory locations to poke, I&#39;d accept the point. But as it is, I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s valid.</p>
<p>As you point out, the documentation says that these styles cannot be modified. Clearly, this is in error because, as has been shown by demonstration, they *can*. If they could not, SetWindowLong() would return 0 indicating error, and GetLastError() would return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER or similar. Rather, you &quot;should not&quot; or &quot;must not&quot; modify the styles except as noted.</p>

		<p>@Karellen:</p>
<p>int *p = null;</p>
<p>*p = 42;</p>
<p>is perfectly valid code, which will compile perfectly fine and throw no errors. It will, however, crash at runtime. Just because something is valid in one sense does not mean it is valid in another, and the behavior itself is well documented.</p>

		<p>There are also weird cases like the progress bar where you have to both send PBM_SETMARQUEE *and* set/clear PBS_MARQUEE to turn marquee mode on/off.</p>
<p>(MSDN mentions having to set the style but not having to clear it as well. I wonder why either is necessary, since the message handler could implicitly modify the style. Maybe it&#39;s unintentional but too late to change.)</p>

		<p>&quot;To enable and disable a window, use the EnableWindow function&quot; &#8211; from the people that bought you the ability to shut down from the &quot;Start&quot; button :-) And, pre-empting anyone who claims this is snarky, it&#39;s just a bit of humour. I actually like the concept of the start button. Far better than trying to find anything in Win 3.11. Maybe it should have been called &quot;Attention&quot; or &quot;Oi!&quot; or something else.</p>

<p>is patently NOT &quot;valid&quot; code. &nbsp;It is certainly legal, compilable code, but that is NOT what constitutes validity, otherwise there would be no &quot;bugs&quot; in any software produced as the result of a successful compilation.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230; that bought you the ability to shut down from the &quot;Start&quot; button :-) And, pre-empting anyone who claims this is snarky, it&#39;s just a bit of humour.&quot;</p>
<p>Humour that&#39;s been done to death. I doubt it can be appreciated by anyone who reads here for more than a week.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;To enable and _disable_ a window, use the EnableWindow() function</p>
<p>Is it just me or the underlined part somehow doesn&#39;t go well with that function name? :p</p>
<p>Seriously, there should have been DisableWindow() function as well. Having a function that does two things and naming it such that what it does is not obvious unless you examine the passed variables is not a bad design, it is just retarded.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Just like how the <code>setbuf</code> function removes buffering and QWidget::setEnabled is used to disable the widget. If it offends you so much, pretend the function is called <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Enabled&shy;State</code>. -Raymond</i>]</div>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
