<p> That reminded me of a similar "inadvertent confirmation" from a local news story many years ago. Someone was admitted to the hospital with acute poisoning, and the local newspaper called to determine whether it was an attempted suicide. The hospital confirmed that the person had been admitted, but declined to discuss whether it was due to a suicide attempt. "Our privacy policy forbids us from revealing any further information about patients who are admitted after an attempted suicide." </p>

		<p>If DoJ launches an investigation, that&#8217;s an active response. &nbsp;The hospital&#8217;s case is more passive, and could it be that if a third-party inquirer even mentions the word &quot;suicide&quot; that invokes a business rule at the hospital to clamp down for the remainder of the inquiry? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine an intelligence agency counting on or encouraging a DoJ investigation to make a deliberate misinformation release appear to other spies to be true&#8230;</p>

		<p>I think I agree with keith. &nbsp;The wording kind of makes it sound like an admission, but it really seems to be more of a blanket statement; i.e. &quot;We can neither confirm nor deny that it was a suicide attempt&quot;.</p>

		<p>If that hospital spokesperson was really trying not to confirm anything, they would have stopped at &quot;Our privacy policy forbids us from revealing any further information.&quot;</p>
<p>The person might as well have said: &quot;The policy prohibits releasing information on patients who attempt suicide, which obviously applies in this case, so I can&#8217;t tell you anything.&quot;</p>

		<p>These people need to be prepared to give complete non-committal answers. &nbsp;Like when I get my wife&#8217;s Christmas gifts. &nbsp;She tries to get &quot;clues&quot; from me. &nbsp;I have to be prepared to answer questions like, &quot;Is it something that I wear?&quot;</p>
<p>I have to prepare myself to tell her that I won&#8217;t answer any questions about that topic ever. &nbsp;If I don&#8217;t then she&#8217;ll see my face and be able to infer if she is right (she knows me way too well.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when I walk in the door from my shopping, I am full on prepared to say, &quot;Maybe. &nbsp;I will never ever say anything to any of your questions except &#8216;maybe&#8217;.&quot;</p>

		<p>Scientology is notorious for suing people who publish their &quot;secret&quot; information by invoking copyright law.</p>

		<p>google for Erin Andrews, who was filmed naked in a hotel room. Nobody could recognize her on the video but to quote another forum:</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Saw this quote from Erin Andrews from the AP (you know when the AP is reporting on it, it&#8217;s gone big time).</p>
<p>She said she decided to confirm it &quot;To put an end to rumor and speculation and to put the perpetrator and those complicit on notice that they act at their own peril&quot;</p>
<p>&#8212; Now why you&#8217;d want to &quot;put an end to rumor and speculation&quot; and confirm it, I don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s enough rumor and speculation on the internet that I think most people ignore it (honestly I think most of us hadn&#8217;t even heard of this alleged video until it was confirmed).</p>
<p>But you gotta give her credit for being brave and coming foward. Plus coming foward is a big F-ck You to the guy who filmed it.</p>
<p>Also I guess it would be pretty hard to persue any legal action against the guy who filmed it without coming foward (that&#8217;s probably her real motivation for admitting it). We&#8217;ve all heard the news stories about the guys being busted for setting up video cameras in bathrooms or locker rooms. I don&#8217;t know how stiff the legal penalties are, I don&#8217;t remember what they get charged with, but I would think she could really nail him with a civil case. She could claim &quot;irreperable harm to her career&quot;, which I don&#8217;t think is true, but I&#8217;m sure a jury would buy it. Plus the burden of proof is much lower for a civil case versus a criminal case (remember the Robert Blake trial&#8211; acquiited of murder in the criminal case but nailed in the civil suit).</p>

		<p>Happens with a certain secretive Fruit company as well. When new product rumors abound, we see the photos and wait a few days. If the photos are still up, it&#8217;s a dud rumor. If there&#8217;s a legal request to take them down, bingo!</p>
<p>Though, I think they&#8217;ve stopped doing that for precisely that reason&#8230;</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s at least one option that the Justice Department has to prevent this kind of confirmation, called a &quot;Glomar Response&quot;</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_response" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_response</a></p>

		<p>The prerequisites are like the sign in liquor stores that say “We card everyone under 30.” &nbsp;Whenever I get carded I point to their sign and tell them I’m not under 30 so you don’t need to card me. &nbsp;For some reason they don’t follow their own rules and check my Id anyway.</p>

		<p>@Joe Sixpack:</p>
<p>The logic you presented in the liquor store argument is a specific type of logical fallacy. &nbsp;Wikipedia refers to it as Affirming the Consequent: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent</a></p>
<p>Wikipedia has this example:</p>
<p>A: All Republicans are pro-life.</p>
<p>B: That&#8217;s not true. My uncle&#8217;s pro-life and he&#8217;s not a Republican.</p>
<p>To put it the way you did:</p>
<p>A: They card everyone under 30.</p>
<p>B: That&#8217;s not true. &nbsp;You&#8217;re over 30 and they carded you.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the catch? &nbsp;The sign says nothing about carding people over 30.</p>

		<p>@R. Bemrose:</p>
<p>Not quite. &nbsp;The point is they need to check my Id to determine if they need to check my Id.</p>
<p>The sign implies some people are carded others are not. Unless they card everybody they can&#8217;t (reliably) know if they carded everybody under 30. &nbsp;The sign should read &quot;We card everybody&quot; because it is the only way they can ensure they carded everybody under 30.</p>
<p>Because of this the sign is silly just like it silly for me to suggest that they don&#8217;t need to card me because of what the sign says.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
