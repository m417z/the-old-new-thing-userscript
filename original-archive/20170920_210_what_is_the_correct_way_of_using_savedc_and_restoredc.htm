<p>
There are these two functions <code>SaveDC</code>
and <code>RestoreDC</code>.
How do they work?
</p>
<p>
Each device context (DC) maintains a stack of saved states.
When you call <code>SaveDC</code>,
the current state of the DC is saved and pushed onto the stack,
and you get a positive integer representing that saved state.
If you call <code>SaveDC</code> again,
a new saved state is created and pushed onto the stack,
and you get a new integer that represents the second state.
Each call to
<code>SaveDC</code> pushes the current state onto this internal stack.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways to call the <code>RestoreDC</code> function.
One is to pass a negative number.
This indicates how many states to pop off the stack,
and the last state popped off the stack is applied to the DC.
</p>
<p>
The other (more common) way to call the <code>RestoreDC</code> function
is to pass a specific state.
In that case, the specific state is restored, and that state is
popped off the stack.
And since it's a stack, this also means that any states that were
pushed onto the stack after that point are also popped off.
</p>
<p>
And of course you cannot restore a state to a DC different
from the DC you saved it from.
(Because each DC has a separate stack of saved states.)
</p>
<p>
For concreteness, let's say that we've saved the state three times:
</p>
<pre>
SelectObject(hdc, GetStockObject(NULL_BRUSH));
int state1 = SaveDC(hdc);
SelectObject(hdc, GetStockObject(WHITE_BRUSH));
int state2 = SaveDC(hdc);
SelectObject(hdc, GetStockObject(BLACK_BRUSH));
int state3 = SaveDC(hdc);
SelectObject(hdc, GetStockObject(DC_BRUSH));
</pre>
<p>
State 1 has the null brush,
state 2 has the white brush,
state 3 has the black brush,
and the current state (not saved) has the
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050420-28/?p=35843">
DC brush</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here's what could happen next:
</p>
<table BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="3" CELLSPACING="0" STYLE="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<th>Negative argument</th>
<th>Equivalent positive argument</th>
<th>Result</th>
<th>Stack</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>RestoreDC(-1)</code></td>
<td><code>RestoreDC(state3)</code></td>
<td>Current brush is black</td>
<td>state2 (top), state1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>RestoreDC(-2)</code></td>
<td><code>RestoreDC(state2)</code></td>
<td>Current brush is white</td>
<td>state1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>RestoreDC(-3)</code></td>
<td><code>RestoreDC(state1)</code></td>
<td>Current brush is null</td>
<td>empty</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that the state that is applied gets popped off the stack,
which means that each state can be restored at most once.</p>

		<p>My completely unfounded assumption would be that it does nothing, but there&#8217;s an array of various backward compatibility shims to handle poorly-written programs that expect it to do nothing in subtly different ways.</p>

		<p>According to the documentation ( <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd162929(v=vs.85)" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd162929(v=vs.85)</a>.aspx ): &#8220;nSavedDC [in]: The saved state to be restored. If this parameter is positive, nSavedDC represents a specific instance of the state to be restored. If this parameter is negative, nSavedDC represents an instance relative to the current state. For example, -1 restores the most recently saved state.&#8221; Zero is not in the set of documented values, so it&#8217;s technically undefined. I can&#8217;t see what specifying zero would do besides nothing, but there is a lacuna in the documentation so a conforming implementation could in theory reformat your hard drive! :-)</p>

		<p>SaveDC returns zero on error, so it would be sensible for RestoreDC to ignore it.</p>

		<p>In wine, at least, RestoreDC(0) returns FALSE (i.e. failure.)</p>

		<p>As a side note, I think at least one win32k update had problems with SaveDC/RestoreDC, right?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
