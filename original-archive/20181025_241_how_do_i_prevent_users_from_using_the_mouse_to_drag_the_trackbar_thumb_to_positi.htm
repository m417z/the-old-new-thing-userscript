A customer had a
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb760149(v=vs.85).aspx">
trackbar common control</a>,
set the range to 0&ndash;100,
set the line size to 5
(so that pressing an arrow key moves the thumb by five units),
and set the page size to 20
(so that pressing the <code>PgUp</code> and <code>PgDn</code> keys
move the thumb by twenty units).
This ensures that the keyboard can set the trackbar position only
to values that are multiples of five.
But the user can still drag the thumb with the mouse and set the
position to any value, even values that aren't multiples of five.
The customer wanted to limit the trackbar to positions that are
multiples of five.
</p>
<p>
The trackbar allows the thumb position to be any value between the
minimum and maximum.
It's like a scroll bar in that way.
If you want the trackbar to operate only in multiples of five,
then just divide everything by five.
Set the range to 0&ndash;20,
set the line size to 1,
and
set the page size to 4.
When you read the trackbar position,
just multiply it by five when you read the value out.
</p>
<p>
Take
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20030723-00/?p=43073">
the scratch program</a>
and make the following changes:
</p>
<pre>
<font COLOR="blue">#include &lt;strsafe.h&gt;</font>

BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
 <font COLOR="blue">g_hwndChild = CreateWindow(TRACKBAR_CLASS, TEXT(""),
    WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE,
    0, 0, 100, 100,
    hwnd, (HMENU)100, g_hinst, 0);

  SendMessage(g_hwndChild, TBM_SETRANGE, TRUE, MAKELPARAM(0, 20));
  SendMessage(g_hwndChild, TBM_SETPAGESIZE, 0, 4);</font>

  return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>
The line size defaults to 1, so we didn't have to set it explicitly.
</p>
<pre>
<font COLOR="blue">void OnHScroll(HWND hwnd, HWND hwndCtl, UINT code, int pos)
{
 if (hwndCtl == g_hwndChild) {
  TCHAR buf[128];
  pos = (int)SendMessage(hwndCtl, TBM_GETPOS, 0, 0) * 5;
  StringCchPrintf(buf, ARRAYSIZE(buf), TEXT("pos = %d"), pos);
  SetWindowText(hwnd, buf);
 }
}

    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_HSCROLL, OnHScroll);</font>
</pre>
<p>
When we are told that the scroll position changed,
we fetch the current trackbar position,
<i>multiply it by five</i>,
and then show the result.
</p>
<p>
The user can drag the trackbar thumb to any unit position,
but since we multiply the result by five, the effective behavior
is that they can drag the thumb to any position that is a multiple
of five.
</p>
<p>
This works great until you get a bug report
(perhaps from a government agency)
that your program is not accessible
because the accessibility tools report a scroll bar
whose minimum, maximum, and position are all off by
a factor of five.
</p>
<p>
To fix this problem, we'll have to take a different approach.
We'll take up this issue next time.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
