		<p>In curling you need to be able to move down ice rapidly but still be able to stop and stand still.  Skates would wreck the ice surface, so what you do is put duct tape on the sole of one shoe.  You can move by keeping the slippy taped foot on the ice and push yourself along with the grippy foot.</p>
<p>Serious curlers have special teflon shoe covers made, but if you&#8217;re just going out for fun, duct tape will do just fine.</p>
<p>And remember, the best part of curling is the yelling.  SWEEP!  SWEEP HARDER YOU IDIOTS!  NOT THAT HARD!</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that this is the only dedicated facility west of the Rockies.  Long ago in my childhood days, there was a curling club in Fairbanks, Alaska. The urban legend (or maybe it was true?) was that it was one of the few curling clubs in the world that needed heaters to keep the ice warm enough to play.</p>

		<p>I remember NBC showed curling twice earlier this year (US and world championships, I think).  But the matches were on tape delay and heavily edited, so I couldn&#8217;t really get a feel for the game as a whole. :/</p>

		<p>Wow, I had no idea that there were that few curling clubs in parts of the US.  Living in Canada, I guess I took for granted that every town would have atleast one rink.  As for the sliders, I recommend curling shoes (check out <a href="http://www.asham.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.asham.com</a>) &#8211; they look just like normal sneakers, but the sole of one shoe will be slippery, while the other has a good grip on the ice.</p>

		<p>hmmmmm, I get into Sumo about the same way. I love it when it&#8217;s on TV but never think of it otherwise.</p>

		<p>I remember NBC showing quite a few games during the last winter olympics (although they were probably on their various cable channels rather than NBC proper).  As for cool curling links, I really like the flash animations of the curling strategy:<br />
<a href="http://www.curlingbasics.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.curlingbasics.com/</a><br />
One of the best uses of Flash I have ever seen and certainly useful to someone like me who was introduced to the sport for the first time last Olympics.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
