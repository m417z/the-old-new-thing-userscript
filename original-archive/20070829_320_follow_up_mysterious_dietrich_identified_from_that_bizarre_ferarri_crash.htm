<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/20/849576.aspx"> Last year</a>, a spectacular crash of a $1 million Ferrari left a lot of questions unanswered. Who were those mysterious men who picked up Eriksson? How did a fully loaded automatic pistol get under the seat of a person who stopped to help? Why exactly does the San Gabriel Valley Transit Authority have an anti-terrorism unit? And who is this mysterious Dietrich who was allegedly driving the car when it crashed?</p>
<p> Well, the authorities think they have an answer to that last question. <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003832646_car12.html"> Trevor Karney is in custody</a> on charges of drunken driving, among others. He gave a false address to the police, and while they were trying to track him down, he slipped out of the country, then slipped back in. His story was (get this) that he was a passenger in a Mercedes that was behind the Ferrari, and when it crashed, the driver of the Mercedes stopped, Karney got out, and the Mercedes drove off without him. </p>
<p> Authorities believe that Karney is the mysterious Dietrich, and that he was a passenger in the crashed Ferrari. </p>
<p> (Eriksson was sentenced to 3&frac12; years in prison for embezzlement and drunken-driving.) </p>

		<p>3&#189; years for crashing a $1 million Ferrari? Totally worth it.</p>

		<p>There cannot be a stranger ending to an otherwise interesting device made by the company these guys worked for (Gizmondo, the game platform running Windows CE, not to be confused with Gizmodo, the gadget blog)&#8230;.</p>

		<p>3.5 years wasn&#8217;t just for crashing the ferrari, apparently this dood is a &nbsp;lifetime criminal and is facing many charges. &nbsp;There is a huge wired article on this guy and his past, basically it sums up that he is a gangster from the streets of Finland, who used his criminal ways to live a life of splendor. &nbsp;Any I highly recommend looking up the article and reading up.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the wired article about this whole thing and more for those too lazy to search. &nbsp;It&#8217;s quite interesting and I&#8217;m also really surprised Dietrich actually exists.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
