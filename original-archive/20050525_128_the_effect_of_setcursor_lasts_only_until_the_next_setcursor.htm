<p>
Of course the effect of
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/resources/cursors/cursorreference/cursorfunctions/setcursor.asp">
the <code>SetCursor</code> function</a>
for a thread
lasts only until that thread changes the cursor to something else.
Any moron knows that, right?
</p>
<p>
The tricky part is that the <code>SetCursor</code> may come from
an unexpected place.
</p>
<p>
THe most common place people run into this is when they do something
like this:
</p>
<pre>
// Put up the hourglass
HCURSOR hcurPrev = SetCursor(hcurWait);
... do some processing ...
// Restore the original cursor
SetCursor(hcurPrev);
</pre>
<p>
This puts up the hourglass during the processing.
But if you pump messages (or if a function you call pumps messages),
then the hourglass will go away and return to the normal arrow.
</p>
<p>
That's because when you pump messages, this opens the gates for
messages like <code>WM_NCHITTEST</code> and <code>WM_SETCURSOR</code>.
The latter in particular will typically result in the cursor changing,
either to a cursor selected by the window itself or to the class
cursor if the message makes it all the way to <code>DefWindowProc</code>.
</p>
<p>
If you want to keep the hourglass up even while pumping messages,
you need to let the window know that "If you are asked to set the cursor,
please put up an hourglass instead of what you would normally display
as the cursor."  That window would then have to alter its
<code>WM_SETCURSOR</code> handling to take this setting into account.
</p>
<pre>
case WM_SETCURSOR:
 if (ForceHourglass()) {
   SetCursor(hcurWait);
   return TRUE;
 }
 ...
</pre>
<p>
Note that forcing the hourglass is only the tip of the iceberg.
Even though the cursor is an hourglass, the window is still active
and can receive other message, such as mouse clicks and keypresses.
If your program is not ready to receive new input during this phase,
you need to detect this case and not go into some recursive state
if the user, say, impatiently clicks the "Compute!" button while you
are still computing.</p>

		<p>What about calling SetClassLongPtr() with the GCLP_HCURSOR param.  Is this an acceptable alternative, or does this have issues of it&#8217;s own?</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s why OLE doesn&#8217;t work. Your application can be all innocently repainting its window in WM_PAINT, including asking OLE to paint any embedded objects that may be lying around&#8230; but while it&#8217;s waiting in a message pump for that repaint to finish, anything can happen.<br />
<br />Including the entire window getting resized because the user has just pressed Alt+L to lock his computer. And of course your paint routine knew things like that wouldn&#8217;t happen, didn&#8217;t it? And of course it calculated and saved the window size and so on, to save time, didn&#8217;t it?</p>

		<p>Does this apply to ShowCursor as well? I&#8217;ve noticed that the cursor, once hidden, tends to reappear if my app changes video modes for our head-mounted display. (Since we use OpenGL rather than Direct3D, it&#8217;s a hack involving ChangeDisplaySettingsEx, ShowCursor, and some window resizing.)</p>

		<p>Never mind. Adding a WM_SETCURSOR handler seemed to clear everything up.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
