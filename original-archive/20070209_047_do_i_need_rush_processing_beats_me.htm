<p>During the preparations for the 2005 PDC, I was filling out an application for a corporate credit card. (The rant behind why I was filling out this application in the first place will have to wait for another day.) One of the options was to check a box to request rush processing at an additional charge of $10.</p>
<p> There was one key piece of information missing: How much faster is rush processing compared to regular processing? </p>
<p> I needed the card in three weeks. The web site didn't say how long normal processing took. It didn't say how long rush processing took. It just asked me if I wanted to pay extra to go faster. </p>
<p> I took my chances and decided not to request rush processing. The confirmation page included the standard information, giving me an order number and confirming various bits of information that I had previously entered. And then it said, "This will typically take 7 to 10 business days." </p>
<p> Thanks a lot for giving me that crucial information <i>after it's too late for me to do anything about it</i>. Fortunately, ten days was plenty of time. </p>

		<p>Often the two queues differ by other parameters than average wait time.</p>
<p>Standard : typically from 7 to 10 days.</p>
<p>Rush : guaranteed in 12 days.</p>

		<p>When I ordered my phone from Vonage, they had 3 shipping options and the most expensive one said next-day, the next one said 2 days, and the third one said 3-5 days. I chose the cheapest one and got my phone the very next day. It&#8217;s almost as if their profit model is based on people choosing the higher priced shipping options.</p>

		<p>Nish, I have the same experience with &quot;super saver&quot; shipping at Amazon. 7-10 day &quot;super saver&quot; shipping usually comes the exact same time as 2-day shipping.</p>
<p>I think it all depends on how close you are to the nearest Amazon warehouse, how many other orders there are, and whether stuff you order is already in stock at that particular warehouse. In other words, I think it&#8217;s just a fluke.</p>
<p>That said, if you know about it&#8230; you can save a ton of money. I never order from Amazon now unless I can get &quot;super saver&quot; because free 2-day shipping rocks.</p>

		<p>The last time I renewed my UK passport, the standard time was 2 weeks for processing. &nbsp;However, you could pay extra for fast processing, which only took 24-48 hours.</p>
<p>The only slight wrinkle was that you had to call and arrange the appointment for fast processing 2 weeks in advance.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still trying to work that one out.</p>

<p>It seems to be something of a fluke. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My experience is that Super Saver shipping is usually 2 days, but every once in a while something&#8217;s only in stock in their California warehouse and can take a week to arrive.</p>

		<p>What I hate is paying an extra $30 for rush shipping, only to find out that &quot;rush&quot; applies only to shipping and not to the 3 weeks that processing itself takes. If I&#8217;m going to be without my product for 3 weeks while you sit on the order, why would I care if it takes an extra few days to get to me?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve encountered the same thing at online stores. My understanding is that &quot;rush&quot; orders are placed in a separate &quot;rush&quot; queue that is always emptied before any non-rush orders are processed. Since the processing time might vary wildly depending on the number of orders in each queue at any given moment, it is probably difficult to come up with a reasonable estimate of processing time. The situation is further complicated by the unpredictability of actual delivery time.</p>
<p>In your case, they gave you an estimate anyway &#8212; but too late in the process. I agree that this is nonsensical.</p>
<p>*Some* upfront estimate would be nice. However, that puts the store in danger of being held to its estimates by unreasonable customers. If they had told you upfront that delivery &quot;typically take[s] 7 to 10 business days&quot; without rush processing, and it ended up taking just over three weeks, many people in your shoes would have then complained.</p>

		<p>Raymond: In your case, the wrong decision would have cost you $10. In the case I was referring to, the wrong decision could have lost quite some time &#8211; and what much developer time is worth $10?</p>
<p>(The decision being &quot;is this process hung and do I kill it, or does it just appear to be hung?&quot;. And by the way it wasn&#8217;t based on a progress bar, the damn thing didn&#8217;t show a progress bar until tens of minutes later.)</p>

		<p>How long did it *actually* take?</p>
<p>Have you spoken to anyone who did request rush processing?</p>
<p>Is the $10 charge on the card, or to you?</p>
<p>Also, as your story was amusing, why do I need more information to evaluate it?</p>

<p>The last time I renewed in the UK I just turned up at the office in London and they gave me a number. They had a sign up telling how many were being processed an hour so I could time it in the pub, without losing my turn. Stunningly efficient.</p>

		<p>I once bought a phone online from Carphone Warehouse (UK Mobilde phone company). Throughout the order preocess they assured me it would be delivered the next day. When I got to the payment confirmed screen, it said &quot;Due to high demand, delivery is currently 3 days.&quot;</p>
<p>Funny they didn&#8217;t tell me that earlier in my order&#8230;</p>

<p>Except that every Microsoft patch/Service Pack that I&#8217;ve ever installed makes you agree to the EULA before you can install it. That&#8217;s giving you all the information while you can still do something about it (eg hit the Cancel button).</p>
<p>What? You didn&#8217;t bother reading the EULA before clicking &quot;I Agree&quot;? Not Microsoft&#8217;s fault, all the info&#8217;s there but they can&#8217;t force you to pass your eyes over the wole thing.</p>
<p>Ok so it could be worded better for a non-lawyer to skim and parse, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re not giving the info at the right time.</p>

		<p>Jim, you&#8217;re missing my point about changing the rules during the game.</p>
<p>&quot;The game&quot; here is the lifetime of Windows 2000, meaning the time it&#8217;s installed. I believe most computer literate people to read &quot;Service Pack&quot; as something performing service on a (defect, or at least suboptimal) piece of software.</p>
<p>When changing the rules of the game by changing the software license, and you are stuck there (or perhaps we should have all installed yet unproven XP by then and sent the bill to you?), then I and millions of people have every right to be seriously pissed off.</p>
<p>Yes, MS did present the EULA for sp3 before it was installed. Thanks to that, millions of machines were never patched until sp4 (where they reverted the horrible stuff from sp3).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
