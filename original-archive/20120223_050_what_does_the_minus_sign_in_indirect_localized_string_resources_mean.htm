<p>The syntax for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd374120.aspx"> indirect localized string resources</a> is <code>@</code><i>filename</i><code>,-</code><i>stringId</i>, optionally followed by a semicolon and a comment. A customer wanted to know what the minus signs stands for.</p>
<p> The minus sign doesn't "stand for" anything. It's just part of the syntax. It's like asking what the semicolon at the end of a C statement stands for. It doesn't stand for anything; it's just part of the rules for C statements. (And if the minus sign has to stand for something, what does the comma stand for?) </p>
<p> Okay, so maybe the question was really "Why does the syntax for indirect localized strings include a minus sign? Isn't the comma enough?" </p>
<p> From a parsing standpoint, the comma is enough. The syntax for indirect strings was influenced by the syntax for icon locations, which also takes the form <i>filename</i><code>,</code><i>number</i>. We saw some time ago that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/05/26/422076.aspx"> the number after the comma can be positive or negative or zero</a>. If positive or zero, it specifies the zero-based icon index. If negative, then it specifies the (negative of the) icon ID. </p>
<p> The indirect string syntax follows the same pattern, except that they don't support string indices. (As we saw earlier when we studied <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/30/65013.aspx"> the format of string resources</a>, a null string is indistinguishable from no string at all, which makes string indices largely meaningless since you can't tell whether a null string should be counted towards the index or not.) Since the only thing supported is IDs, and IDs are expressed as negative values, the first thing after the comma is always a minus sign. </p>
<p> Next time, we'll take a closer look at that comment field. </p>

		<p>It&#39;s like a flag. The @ stands for our land, the , stands for our history, and the &#8211; stands for defense against invaders.</p>

		<p>So basically indirect-string:filename?index=123 vs. indirect-string:filename?id=456</p>

		<p>Icons don&#39;t use a @ in front of the filename. So it&#39;s not that the format for strings is the same as the one for icons, it&#39;s just that an implementation detail for icons that&#39;s meaningless for strings was for some reason used for strings. That&#39;s fine, but it seems a bit silly to pretend there&#39;s a good reason for it (unless it&#39;s just a way to get in a free sneer at the person asking the question).</p>

		<p>Since we&#39;re on topic of localization: will Windows ever learn to use plural forms in languages that use more than two of them? (Actually, does the current MUI format even allow for something like this?)</p>

		<p>I wish I was reading oldnewthing back in 2003.</p>
<p>That entry does explain the weird phrasing I see all around the UI (the most common &#8211; &quot;X items selected&quot; in Slovenian is translated as &quot;This number of items is selected: X&quot; &#8211; and it sounds much worse in Slovenian). Such phrasing is really unusual in Slovenian, and stands out, which is why I was wondering if the support for plural forms can be added in a future version of Windows (I&#39;ve also seen places where &quot;X things&quot; was used [in Slovenian], which was not the right plural form for X). A certain popular open-source localization framework has a working solution.</p>
<p>BTW, that article mentions that Slovenian has dual &#8211; this is true, but we actually use 4 different forms depending on the number of items.</p>

		<p>So what you&#39;re saying is that the minus sign stands for &quot;use icon id rather than index&quot;, as semicolon in C++ stands for &quot;end of statement&quot; and comma stands for &quot;end parameter with another parameter following&quot;.</p>

		<p>Reading that old topic again, since I&#39;ve read something about complex script from Micheal Kaplan&#39;s blog, I&#39;d think the rotating rule should be governed by the fonts themselve instead of specific code of the toolbar. (I checked to see there&#39;s no such indicator in complex script specification, just suggesting it&#39;s possible to do so there)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
