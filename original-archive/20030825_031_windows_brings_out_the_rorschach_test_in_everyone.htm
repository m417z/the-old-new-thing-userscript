<p>         It seems that no matter what you do, somebody will get offended.      </p>
<p>         Every Windows 95 box has an anti-piracy hologram on the side. The photographer chose         his infant son as his model, since the human face is very hard to copy accurately.         The baby sits next to a computer, and as you turn the hologram, his arm rises and         points at the computer monitor, which bursts into a Windows 95 logo.      </p>
<p>         How cute. And everybody loves babies.      </p>
<p>         Until we got a complaint from a government (who shall remain nameless for obvious         reasons) that was upset with Windows 95 because it depicted naked children.      </p>
<p>         "Naked children!?" we all thought to ourselves.      </p>
<p>         They were complaining about the hologram on the box. The baby wasn't wearing a shirt.         Even though the baby was visible only from the waist up, the offended government assumed         that he wasn't wearing pants either.      </p>
<p>         We had to produce a new hologram. In the new hologram, the baby is wearing a shirt <u>and</u>&nbsp;overalls.         But since this was a rush job, we didn't have time to do the arm animation.      </p>
<p>         So if you still have your copy of Windows 95, go look at the hologram. If the baby         in your hologram isn't wearing a shirt, you have a genuine collector's item. I have         seen the "naked baby" hologram but unfortunately my copy of Windows 95 has a clothed         baby.      </p>
<p>         If you hunt around the web, you can find lots of other people who claim to have found         subliminal messages in Windows 95. My favorite is the one who claims to have found         images in the clouds bitmap. Hey, they're clouds. They're Nature's Rorschach Test.      </p>
<p>         Windows XP had its own share of complaints. The original wallpaper for Windows XP         was Red Moon Desert, until people claimed that Red Moon Desert looked like a pair         of buttocks. People also thought that one of the generic people used in the User Accounts         control panel people looked like Hitler. And one government claimed the cartoon character         in the original Switch Users dialog looked like an obscene body part. We had to change         them all. But it makes me wonder about the mental state of our beta testers...      </p>

		<p>I used to work at Microsoft. I remember &quot;urban legends&quot; about user complaints about some OS filenames. Supposedly, HIMEM.SYS sounds too much like hymen, so it must be obscene.</p>
<p>And Windows 98 (I think) had some MTV content. Some of the MTV content was about teen sex education (I think). People complained because one of the filenames was TEENSEX.GIF, which obviously must be pornographic. It was just a bitmap of the Mars and Venus sex symbols.</p>

		<p>Lol!  I remember that wingdings thing.  There was a GREAT article by, I believe, Penn of Penn &amp; Teller in one of the PC mags about it.  It was absolutely hilarious.  He came up with another word that, when translated to Wingdings Paranoia, meant &quot;Planes carrying Christians in snowstorms must stop!&quot;  Priceless.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing the trouble people will go through in order to be pissed off.</p>

		<p>Well, outraged self-righteous people find offensive subliminal messages in Disney films too&#8230;I agree, some people seem to be looking for a crusade to fight.</p>

		<p>ianel told me that the pakistani government complained that the original timezone picker in the &#8217;95 betas (which allowed you to click on your country in the map) attributed the three pixels representing kashmir to india&#8217;s timezone and unless microsoft switched clicks on them to pakistani time they would ban sales of the product. the interactive feature was thus disabled.</p>

		<p>Well considering that both India and Pakistan still claim Jammu and Kashmir to be their own (even though it is technically in both countries), I guess they had the right to complain.  The method that XP uses for time zones (City Name + GMT offset) would have solved it nicely.<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
