		<p>CAD was used in DOS to reboot, and I&#39;m pretty sure that Windows NT simply reused the key combination because it was guaranteed not to be used by any normal program.

		<p>I think it&#39;s a bit ironic that, having read the entire thesis of &quot;To Wash It All Away&quot;, I find the only part that isn&#39;t true is the passage about browser caches. Whenever I have a problem that defies all other attempts at debugging, clearing the browser cache tends to reliably work.</p>
<p>But maybe he&#39;s talking about clearing a cache to fix a problem on somebody else&#39;s web site, and not the one you&#39;re developing. </p>

		<p>That Hampton, FL link reminds me of Linndale, OH. It&#39;s a village of 179 people just outside of Cleveland that manages to fund approximately 80% of its $1,000,000/year budget with speeding tickets on a 422 yard (yes, as in 1266 feet) stretch of I-71 that runs through it. The segment of roadway within the village limits is so small, village police officers actually have to leave their own jurisdiction to enter and exit the highway.</p>
<p>Even with the abolishment of their mayor&#39;s court by Ohio state legislation last year, the village plans to continue patrolling and issuing citations as they always have.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve been through Hampton, FL, once or twice. &nbsp;It&#39;s just south of Starke, which is ALSO a speed trap, only there, the speed limit drops from 65 to 55, and then to 35 for about a mile, and everybody goes through at exactly 35mph, under the watchful eye of a bunch of cops just waiting for someone to accidentally go 36.</p>
<p>Someone put up a billboard a bit north of Starke, saying it&#39;s a speedtrap&#8230;so the town put up a billboard north of the first one, saying &quot;Starke is not a speed trap. We care about your safety.&quot;</p>
<p>There is no good reason to travel US-301 unless you&#39;re actually going to one of the small towns near it&#8211;it&#39;s narrow and runs through a bunch of little towns, which slows it down&#8230;and of course there&#39;s the two speed traps. &nbsp;Take an interstate instead&#8211;they&#39;re MUCH faster.</p>

		<p>This reminded me of a story I heard a couple weeks ago about another speedtrap town; I think this one&#39;s in California. &nbsp;9 police officers covering a 12-block &quot;town&quot;. &nbsp;They like to cite people for having an &quot;obstructed view&quot;&#8211;basically if you have anything hanging from your rear-view mirror, they&#39;ll ticket you a couple hundred bucks in the name of &quot;safety.&quot; &nbsp;Reason TV, now that I think of it, had the story about it: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIBDlm9ohxI">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a>. &nbsp;The video&#39;s a couple of minutes long and shows a map of the town. &nbsp;The best part is the reporter asking the chief of police why he&#39;s got something hanging off his OWN rear-view mirror.</p>

		<p>No matter how hard I fought to have my thesis as plain-english and readable as possible, my advisor would routinely tell me to stick in words like &quot;methodologies&quot; and replace &quot;use&quot; with &quot;utilize&quot;. &nbsp;My thesis title was like 2 lines of an obtuse mix of academic jargon, but thankfully at least this was before the &quot;Title: Subtitle&quot; trend.</p>
<p>If I had to give it the lol my thesis treatment, it&#39;d simply be &quot;If you want your program to be fast, make sure your processors always have work to do&quot;.</p>

		<p>Lots of those animal names have the same meaning in Swedish as in German too. :)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>racoon &#8211; tvättbjörn (wash bear)</p>

		<p>I found ghosting amusing when I was documenting the behaviour of the Amstrad PC1512 keyboard; there were various positions in the key matrix with no key, but I could make them produce scancodes by pressing the right three keys that did exist. So NumLock + Scroll Lock + Keypad Enter caused the otherwise nonexistent scancode 0x73 to be generated, and so on.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
