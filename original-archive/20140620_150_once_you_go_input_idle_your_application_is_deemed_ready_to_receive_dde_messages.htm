<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/02/26/1763683.aspx"> Feel free to stop using DDE</a>.</p>
<p> There was one customer who confessed that they were still using DDE, and they asked for help debugging a DDE problem. They found that sometimes, when their application was launched for DDE, it never received the <code>WM_<wbr>DDE_<wbr>INITIATE</wbr></wbr></code> message. Instead, the <code>Shell&shy;Execute</code> function returned <code>ERROR_<wbr>DDE_<wbr>FAIL</wbr></wbr></code>. If launched from Explorer, the error message shown to the user was "There was a problem sending the command to the program." </p>
<p> It took a long time to figure out what was going on, and there were a number of dead ends, but I'll cut to the chase: The problem was that one of the features they added to their program included code that ran during process startup, and that code pumped messages as part of its initialization. Message pumping was not expected there, which is why it took so long to isolate. </p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/25/9984720.aspx"> The <code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Input&shy;Idle</code> function was created for DDE</a>. It's how a DDE client determines that the DDE server is ready to accept commands. And as soon as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/26/9985422.aspx"> any thread in your process</a> goes input-idle, the entire process is declared to be input-idle, and you end up becoming eligible to receive DDE messages, <i>even if you're not really ready for them</i>. </p>
<p> In the case of this program, the accidental message pump caused the application to be considered ready to accept DDE commands even though the main DDE server hadn't gotten off the ground yet. The initiation message went to the splash screen, and the splash screen said, "Why are you bothering me with stupid DDE messages? I'm just a splash screen!" </p>
<p> TL;DR: If your application includes a DDE server, make sure not to pump messages until your DDE server is ready to receive commands. </p>

		<p>I get that error message if I double click an office (excel/word/powerpoint/etc.) file while the appropriate office2010 application is still starting up and displaying it&#39;s splash. I seriously hope that office 2010 isn&#39;t using DDE!</p>

		<p>I looked in to the registry for the &quot;open as read-only&quot; verb for Excel 2013 and was astonished to see it was still using DDE. I suppose if it ain&#39;t broken, don&#39;t fix it?</p>

		<p>Hildar: The idea is to reuse an existing Word/Excel/etc. process rather than creating a new one for each file being opened. What would you expect them to use, if not DDE?</p>

		<p>Is there a recommended way for applications to open documents in an existing process without DDE? </p>
<p>Of course it can be done with various IPC mechanisms; I&#39;m specifically asking if one is recommended.</p>

		<p>@immibis, use COM. &nbsp;Explorer will use COM activation if you register your application for a file type with DropTarget (I think there are multiple places in the registry where you can do this), so your application will execute once if the class factory is registered with REGCLS_MULTIPLEUSE.</p>
<p>See Raymond&#39;s entry &quot;How do I accept files to be opened via IDropTarget instead of on the command line?&quot;</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/03/10006065.aspx">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/10006065.aspx</a></p>
<p>See MSDN entry &quot;Application Registration&quot; (in &quot;File Types and File Associations&quot;)</p>

<p>See the Shell SDK &quot;DropTarget Verb Sample&quot;</p>

<p> &nbsp;It really is just a sample, e.g. you&#39;d want to register the class factory as REGCLS_MULTIPLEUSE, you&#39;d (un)register stuff in the registry at (un)installation time.</p>
<p>@Raymond, I&#39;m curious, did you author this sample? &nbsp;The comments are actually quite good.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
