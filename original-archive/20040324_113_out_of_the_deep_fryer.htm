		<p>With their slogan and menu changes I got the feeling that McDonnald&#8217;s no longer loves to see me smile. But then they go and do something like <a target="_new" href="http://www.i-am-asian.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.i-am-asian.com</a> and now I don&#8217;t know what to think.</p>

<p>True, but the cheeseburger also happens to be smaller than the salad; if you select &quot;View per 100g/ml&quot; then the numbers are 5.9 grams of fat for the salad, and 9.5 for the cheeseburger.

		<p>I was disappointed yesterday to find that Burger King (at least here in Manchester, NH) has discontinued its Veggie Burgers after being on the menu for a year or so.</p>

		<p>Of course, the thing that everyone seems to be missing is this:</p>
<p>Most people (unless they&#8217;re really strange) don&#8217;t eat fries with their salads.</p>
<p>Most people do eat fries with a cheeseburger.</p>
<p>And thus endeth the mystery &#8211; it is still a lower calorie meal. And it&#8217;ll fill you up much more than a cheeseburger&#8230;.</p>

		<p>While there are decent veggie burgers, I thought the BK version sucked. One would think in Manchester, NH, there would be reasonable alternatives to BK&#8217;s offering.</p>

		<p>A similar chuckle several years back when McDonald&#8217;s introduced their morning muffins. The Apple bran muffin had more fat (and more overall calories) than their cheeseburger!</p>

<p>&gt; But then they go and do something like<br />
<br />&gt; <a target="_new" href="http://www.i-am-asian.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.i-am-asian.com</a> and now I don&#8217;t<br />

<p>I think most Asians wouldn&#8217;t know what to think either.  Most Asians aren&#8217;t American.  If they find that site and see the assertion that Asians are Americans, they&#8217;d probably spend a few seconds to note one more weirdity about Americans, then forget about it, and move on to another site.</p>
<p>Back to the base note, surely the salad&#8217;s fat content is in the dressing.  Does McDonald&#8217;s offer non-oil dressings?</p>

		<p>Let&#8217;s not ignore that it&#8217;s not how much fat you consume that makes you fat.  Atkins and similar diets are predicated on more or less discounting fat content of food.  But we&#8217;ve been so inundated with the &quot;fat is bad&quot; message and &quot;you are what you eat&quot; (both untrue) for years that I give Raymond a pass on pointing out this non-inconsistency.</p>
<p>Not to say that McDonald&#8217;s is ever going to be a healthy choice, but who cares?  I&#8217;m thin, it tastes good, match made in heaven!  ;-)</p>

		<p>Simon, fries in your salad are commonly referred to as &quot;Pittsburgh-Style&quot;.  In Pittsburgh, you always get them when ordering anything but a house salad.  It&#8217;s really kind of strange.</p>

		<p>Too lazy to check, but I wonder how the salad mentioned compares to Big Macs, Quarter Pounders, or Double Quarter Pounders.  I thought cheeseburgers were for kids&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
