		<p>I have often had targets spotted at Airsoft games (in a forest):</p>
<p>&quot;Behind the tree&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just past that bush&quot;</p>
<p>This usually leads to mockery:</p>
<p>&quot;Behind the tree!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which one?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The one with leaves on!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The green one!&quot;</p>
<p>etc</p>

		<p>So may times during FPS games will I start to call out my position when under fire and die before I can articulate it. &nbsp;L4D/L4D2 is easier so long as your team follows a line of travel because then there are only the two directions of ahead and back and most people watch you when you&#39;re ahead.</p>

		<p>I work in a rather large casino (largest on this side of the planet, over half a mile long) and it is most certainly quite common to hear extremely poor location descriptions from the patrons, especially when they stop you to get directions to one of the 4 parking garages (they dont know which one they parked in, and several of the garages are so large that they have multiple entrances into the building)</p>
<p>There is simply no generic description that will ever suffice (We have 28 &quot;restaurants&quot;, 4 &quot;hotels&quot;, 6500 &quot;slot machines&quot;, 380 &quot;table games&quot;, 5 &quot;ballrooms&quot;, &#8230;)</p>
<p>If you ever visit Foxwoods, do yourself a favor and remember the name of the garage you parked in!</p>

		<p>Foxwoods needs to do something besides name their garages. &nbsp;Paint dice on the walls of one, chips in another, cards in another, etc.. and modify these by floor. &nbsp;That way you can ask a customer what was on the wall in front of his parking space, hear &quot;a royal flush,&quot; and respond with &quot;you are parked on the 3rd floor of such and such garage.&quot;</p>

		<p>GWO: So casino patrons think &quot;I can&#39;t find my car, so I guess I&#39;ll give up and go back to gambling&quot;?</p>

		<p>@bilbert You assume that Foxwoods *want* it to be easy for people to leave. &nbsp;Most casinos consider disorientating the patrons (in space and time) to be a feature, not a bug.</p>

		<p>Overheard as I was entering a Casino&#8230; &quot;I&#39;m just leaving that job in Kent, I&#39;ll be there in 20 minutes&quot; (the casino was not in Kent)</p>
<p>Resolved right then and there that if I ever felt the need to lie about gambling, it would be time to stop forever.</p>

		<p>Gabe: While I can&#39;t speak to impulsive gambling, I have observed that very behavior elsewhere:</p>
<p>&quot;Well, maybe we parked in the other garage.&quot;</p>
<p>*begins walking across mall*</p>
<p>&quot;Ooo, shiny! I forgot Gizmo Co. was releasing Widget N+1 today!&quot;</p>
<p>*returns to shopping*</p>

		<p>@Gabe: No, but every time they go from one car park to another, they have to walk past a load of gaming machines, enticing them to return to gambling. And that will work on some of those people. &nbsp;Hell, in Vegas there are slot machines on the walk between the passport control and the baggage claim &#8211; some people are not very strong willed about such things.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
