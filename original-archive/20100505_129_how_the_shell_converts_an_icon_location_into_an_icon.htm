A customer had trouble getting an icon to display for a registered
file type.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
In my resource file, I specify the icon like this:
</p>
<pre>
101 ICON awesome.ico
</pre>
<p>
And when I register my file type, I set it like this:
</p>
<pre>
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.xyz\DefaultIcon]
@="C:\path\to\awesome.exe,101"
</pre>
<p>
However, when I view an <tt>.xyz</tt> file,
my awesome icon doesn't appear.
On the other hand, if I change the <tt>101</tt> to a <tt>0</tt>,
then it works.
Why?
Isn't the number in the resource file the resource&nbsp;ID?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Why yes, in fact, the number in the resource file is indeed
the resource&nbsp;ID.
But the number after the comma in the <code>Default&shy;Icon</code>
<i>isn't</i>.
</p>
<p>
The format of shell icon locations (used most visibly
by <code>Default&shy;Icon</code>, but also used in other places)
is <code>&laquo;file&raquo;,&laquo;index&raquo;</code>,
where the index is a zero-based index of the icon in your
resources.
In other words,
an index of zero means "Give me the first icon in the file."
The resource compiler sorts icons numerically by resource&nbsp;ID,
so the first icon in the file is the icon with the numerically
lowest resource&nbsp;ID.
In the above example, apparently there are no icons with resource&nbsp;IDs
less than 101;
that would explain why asking for icon index zero results in the awesome
icon.
</p>
<p>
The function behind all this icon hunting is <code>Extract&shy;Icon</code>.
The icon location string is split up at the comma into a path and
an integer, and that path and integer are passed to the
<code>Extract&shy;Icon</code> function.
Since the <code>Extract&shy;Icon</code>
function interprets the integer
as the icon index, that's what the integer in your icon location
string means.
</p>
<p>
In Windows&nbsp;95, the
<code>Extract&shy;Icon</code> function was enhanced
so that you could also specify an icon by its resource&nbsp;ID
by passing its <i>negative</i> as the icon index.
In other words, if you place a negative number after the comma,
then its absolute value is interpreted as the resource&nbsp;ID.
</p>
<p>
We learned some time ago that
there's a hole in this model:
It doesn't work if you want a resource&nbsp;ID of 1,
because
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/05/26/422076.aspx">
the value &minus;1
has a special meaning to <code>Extract&shy;Icon</code></a>:
Instead of extracting an icon, it tells you how many icons there are.
</p>
<p>
The workaround for this is actually straightforward,
and you should be able to figure it out on your own
based on information provided in this article.
How do you specify that you want the icon whose resource&nbsp;ID is 1?</p>

		<p>From the information in the text, I&#8217;d guess that ResourceIDs are strictly positive (that is, positive integers excluding 0). Negative numbers are reserved in ExtractIcon for accessing by ResourceID and 0 is used as an index.</p>
<p>Therefore, the icon with resourceID 1 is always at index 0 (assuming it exists) because no ID can be less than it.</p>

		<p>@Alexandre:</p>
<p>No guesses are necessary.</p>
<p>You can rule out 0 because Raymond clearly says that there is &quot;a hole in this model&quot; which implies exactly one hole. If 0 were a legal resource ID, then the text would have allowed for more than one hole in the model (as it cannot be determined whether 0 is negated or not). &nbsp;A similar argument eliminates negative resource IDs.</p>
<p>Other sorts of resource IDs (strings, complex numbers, brainwave patterns) are eliminated because the compiler is able to sort them numerically.</p>
<p>However, I had to rely on the fact that Raymond implied there was a guaranteed way to access the resource with resource ID 1 to eliminate the possibility of non-integer numeric resource IDs.</p>

		<p>Thanks for posting this. I had wondered why resources in the registry had negative IDs and this explains it.</p>
<p>(I wrote a little LoadString.exe that looks up the string resources referenced in the registry and ran into the negated IDs there. Wish RegEdit displayed the strings automatically these days, since they are used so much for localised strings.)</p>

		<p>&quot;is &#171;file&#187;,&#171;index&#187;, where the index is a zero-based index of the icon in your resources. In other words, an index of zero means &quot;Give me the first icon in the file.&quot; The resource compiler sorts icons numerically by resource ID, so the first icon in the file is the icon with the numerically lowest resource ID&quot;</p>
<p>based on this text i would also say to specify 0 as the index. This is assuming that resource ID&#8217;s are not zero based but start at one. as the text says an index of zero means give me the first icon in the file and the &quot;file&quot; is sorted by resoure ID assendenly. so if the first resource ID is 1 it would be the first icon in the file.</p>

		<p>It must have to be something like causing the integer to roll over by using a value of -65536. Because the line is parsed to pass everything after the &#8211; sign to Extract&#173;Icon which takes an unsigned int. Max int value is 65535.</p>

		<p>@Bob, @kog999</p>
<p>If resource IDs can be 0, 0 would get you the icon with resource ID 0, since 0 would be numerically lowest.</p>
<p>Likewise, if resource IDs can be 0 then 1 does not guarantee getting an icon with resource ID of 1 because if you have an icon with resource ID x&gt;1 and no icon with resource ID 0 then 1 is the 0-indexed icon and x would be the 1-indexed icon.</p>
<p>So I have to say that resource IDs probably can&#8217;t be 0 and it&#8217;s really easy to look up whether that&#8217;s true.</p>

		<p>The answer is to be found in the embedded link about the special meaning of -1: &quot;The format of the icon registration is a filename, optionally followed by a comma and a decimal number.&quot;</p>
<p>Couple that with the fact that the resource compiler sorts icons numerically by resource ID, I will surmize that omitting the optional numeric paramter will default to the first resource, which will be resource #1.</p>

		<p>The fact that icons are sorted by resource ID will surely be key to the answer. Assuming that resource IDs are per definition greater than zero, the resource with ID #1 will always be found at index 0.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not the resource compiler that does the &quot;sort icon by resource IDs&quot; magic last time I checked. It was the Visual Studio resource editor.</p>
<p>Last time I checked (a few VS / PSDK versions ago I might specify), there was still this comment in every generated .rc file about how ICON resources had to be declared in resource ID order for consistency between Windows 9x and Windows NT (one of which, apparently, used the lowest ID whereas the other used the first icon).</p>

		<p>Oh, I don&#8217;t care&#8230; I just found an answer to that particular question. &nbsp;I think the sarcasm of my first answer was not obvious.</p>

		<p>Btw, this is usually not a problem.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve yet to see an application that uses resource id less than 100 for image. (most of them use hundred/thousand digit to seperate id for different resource types.)</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s actually fairly common to have the app icon have a resource id of 1 &#8212; primarily because that ensures that it&#8217;ll get used as the &quot;main&quot; icon for the app, since it&#8217;ll come first (assuming they&#8217;re stored in order of id).</p>
<p>But yes, like Koro said, there are a whole bunch of warnings in generated .rc files and even in some of the PSDK docs that imply that icons are stored in the order they&#8217;re defined, which is not necessarily in id order.</p>

		<p>You can load the icon with resource ID=1 if you use it&#8217;s index instad of it&#8217;s resource ID.</p>

		<p>The answer is in the question. Ask for it by name and pass &#8216;0&#8217; after the comma.</p>

		<p>@anonymous: &nbsp;Another &#8220;please fix&#8221; directed at Raymond. &nbsp;How rude. &nbsp;He is not &#8220;the&#8221; one and only Windows programmer in charge of fixing everything that is demanded of him. &nbsp;I will venture to guess that he couldn&#8217;t fix things like this if he wanted to. &nbsp;(I suspect it&#8217;s out of his direct area of responsibility.)</p>
<p>Raymond has made it clear that he writes these posts on his own time. &nbsp;I think they are fascinating, and it annoys me to see someone interject a &#8220;please fix such and such&#8221; into the comments.</p>
<p>Try <a href="http://wfp.microsoft.com/" rel=nofollow target=_new rel="nofollow">http://wfp.microsoft.com/</a> or <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/common/survey.aspx?scid=sw;en;1076" rel=nofollow target=_new rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/common/survey.aspx?scid=sw;en;1076</a>.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Don&#8217;t worry about &#8220;anonymous&#8221;. He repeats this request about once a month via private email, both to me and to other Microsoft bloggers. It&#8217;s sort of like this buzzing mosquito noise we barely hear any more. Dear anonymous: Like I already said, your request has already been submitted to the appropriate people. Repeat requests accomplish nothing aside from annoying the people who approve/deny requests. (Tip: You don&#8217;t want to annoy the person who can help you.) And thank you for comment-hijacking yet another article. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>It automatically uses icon with resource id 1? Just type the path.</p>

		<p>It depends.. if it takes simply -1 as a special, could specifying -01 change the way it reacts to it?</p>
<p>Though they&#8217;re the same number, they might be handled differently?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
