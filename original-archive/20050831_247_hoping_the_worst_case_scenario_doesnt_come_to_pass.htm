<p> A few years ago, <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> and <a href="http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/"> American RadioWorks</a> ran <a href="http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/wetlands/hurricane1.html"> a story on the consequences to New Orleans of a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane</a> [<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1150366">NPR part 1</a>] [<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1150367">NPR part&nbsp;2</a>].

<p> As you probably know, I'm fascinated by language, particularly the slang terms of various professions, such as <a href="http://www.drliew.net/archives/000673.html"> the rich acronym soup of the emergency medical field</a> (my sick favorite being "CTD"). In the hurricane story, we hear the director of emergency management use the acronym <a href="http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/wetlands/hurricane2.html"> KYAGB</a>, which stands for "Kiss your..." </p>

		<p>When the hurricane went to the East of New Orleans, I thought we would get luckly. For those who don&#8217;t know, the worst of a hurricane heading north is to the east of the eye due to the winds causing the nasty storm surge.</p>

		<p>I knew a guy who was consulting on a new computer system for paramedics. They wanted to call it Emergency Medical System or EMSYS for short. After the paramedics stopped laughing they had to explain that emesis (pronounced the same) means vomit.</p>
<p>(googling, there seems to be a medical school system with the same name. What jokers)</p>

		<p>The impending disaster in the Canary islands will devastate much of the eastern coastline of north America. I wonder how prepared everybody is for that emergency, or if many people even know about it.</p>
<p>Again, it&#8217;s a question of when, not if.</p>

		<p>If New Orleans is built below sea level, can it ever become unflooded? Sounds like &quot;flooded&quot; is the natural steady state for the region formerly known as New Orleans.</p>

		<p>New Orleans is built below sea level, and it does not drain at all to my knowledge.  However, they have a system of levees to keep the water out from the mississipi, and also a number of turbines to drain rain water from the city.  Those turbines were the plan to drain the city before the hurricane, but they drain something like 1 inch an hour. The breaches need to be fixed first for any draining, and I would bet power needs to be restored for the turbines.</p>

		<p>An EMT friend of mine says that EMTs or paramedics who are dealing with an unruly patient in an ambulance will sometimes ask the driver for a BFR: a Bumpy F&#8211;kin&#8217; Ride.  Apparently the driver can raise or lower the suspension on a whim.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
