<p>Code names are rampant at Microsoft. One of the purposes of a code name is to impress upon the people who work with the project that the name is only temporary, and that the final name will come from the marketing folks (who sometimes pull through with a catchy name like <i>Zune</i>, and who sometimes drop the ball with a dud like <i>Bob</i> and who sometimes cough up monstrosities like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jonathanh/archive/2005/08/05/what-s-the-longest-microsoft-product-name.aspx"> <i>Microsoft WinFX Software Development Kit for Microsoft&reg; Pre-Release Windows Operating System Code-Named "Longhorn", Beta 1 Web Setup</i></a>).</p>
<p> What I find amusing are the project which change their code names. I mean, the code name is already a placeholder; why replace a placeholder with another placeholder? </p>
<p> One such example is the experimental project released under the code name <a _href="http://www.microsoft.com/max/" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/max/"> Max</a>. The project founders originally named it M. Just the letter&nbsp;M. Not to be confused with <a href="http://www.jamesbondwiki.com/page/M"> this thing code named&nbsp;M</a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd129519(VS.85).aspx"> this other thing code named&nbsp;M</a>. </p>
<p> In response to a complaint from upper management about single-letter code names, the name was changed to <i>Milkshake</i>, and the team members even made a cute little mascot figure, with a straw coming out the top of his head like a milkshake. </p>
<p> I'm not sure why the name changed a second time. Perhaps those upper level managers didn't think Milkshake was a dignified-enough name. For whatever reason, the name changed yet again, this time to <i>Max</i>. (Wikipedia claims that the project was named after the pet dog of one of the team members; I have been unable to confirm this. Because I haven't bothered trying.) </p>
<p> There's no real punch line here, sorry. Just one example of the naming history of a project that went by many names. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: Apparently the upper management folks who complained about the single-letter code name M were asleep when another product was <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/whs_preview.asp"> code-named Q</a> (now known as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/11/09/9919504.aspx"> Windows Home Server</a>). </p>

		<p>Let&#39;s not forget the entire programming language known as &#39;M&#39;. AKA MUMPS. Or colloquially around these parts: &#39;that piece of crap language, don&#39;t you dare put me anywhere near that thing&#39;. Which is different from Microsoft&#39;s own M language, of course. And definitely not to be confused with M, AKA MATLAB &#8211; another completely unrelated programming language.</p>

		<p>Windows Home Server was originally code-named &quot;Quattro&quot;, but that got changed to &quot;Q&quot; due to fear of infringing on others&#39; trademarks.</p>

		<p>Actually, Raymond, here&#39;s the full story on the Windows Home Server codenames:</p>
<p>The incubation PROJECT for Windows Home Server, when I first started it, was called Quattro. I named it this because this was my fourth attempt to incubate a home server project at Microsoft. The &quot;team&quot; was literally just myself when I first wrote the words &quot;Project Quattro&quot; on a document.</p>
<p>As we progressed and the incubation project transitioned into actually building a PRODUCT, we needed a codename (because the final product name had not been decided and we needed to call it SOMETHING). I wanted to just call it Quattro, but there&#39;s always a risk of using trademarked names for codenames, even if they are never intended to &quot;go public&quot;. &nbsp;Quattro is trademarked by multiple parties including Audi, Schick, and Borland (!). Microsoft&#39;s legal department has guidelines to avoid codenames that might infringe on trademarks and one is to use names of physical places (e.g. cities). &nbsp;My project planner, Todd, suggested <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qaanaaq" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Qaanaaq</a> but we deemed that too esoteric. &nbsp;Then we just decided on &quot;Q&quot;.</p>
<p>After Windows Home Server v1 shipped and we were starting to work on V2, someone on the team came by my office and asked me &quot;Charlie, where did you grow up?&quot; &nbsp;I said &quot;Vail, Colorado&quot;. &nbsp;The next thing I knew V2 was codenamed &quot;Vail&quot;&#8230;.</p>

		<p>I thought this would be about Memphis/Cairo/Blackcomb/Longhorn (Yes, I know that these are not synonymous, but they were so broadly defined that they overlapped. I also know that Cairo turned into Windows 98 and Longhorn into Vista. Wikipedia claims Blackcomb is Windows 7. I&#39;m dubious, but if they&#39;re right 7 itself went from Blackcomb to Vienna to Seven). I recall a joke about the then upcoming Windows .NET, that they could remove the E and just call it Windows NT again.</p>

		<p>And, let us not forget &quot;M&quot; the released product name of the &quot;Microsoft Editor&quot;, MSFT&#39;s first (as far as I know) full screen text editor. I can&#39;t recall now if it was intended as a general purpose text editor, or specifically for programmers. &nbsp;It would soon lead to PWB &#8211; The Programmer&#39;s Work Bench and then to QuickBasic and eventually VisualStudio.</p>

		<p>As someone who worked on windows client, my recollection is: &nbsp;&quot;Longhorn&quot; started out as the umbrella under which Whistler and Blackcomb (Client/Server) lived, and then later came to mean &quot;Vista&quot; (Client &#8212; we got longhorn hats at one point while we were killing ourselves to ship pre-reset, if I recall correctly), and then when Vista neared actual shipping, somehow Longhorn magically morphed to mean Server. &nbsp;I think Longhorn was one of the most misunderstood codenames ever, and that was by the people working on it. :)</p>

		<p>But why was Max killed? What was wrong with a cool WPF app for P2P sharing of photos? Such products should be released unsupported instead of killed. Whoever killed it must be the same guy who decided to kill Windows PowerToys and created the atrocious policy of no unsupported downloads.</p>

		<p>At my current job, we use trees as code names. By the time we release, we are so used to the code name we still use it internally. [Does a quick check.] And, yep, the code name is still in the file version resource for our latest release.</p>

		<p>I was an intern on the Microsoft Max team in summer 2006. I think the milkshake reference was from a song that not everyone liked. I can&#39;t confirm about the dog, but I think I remember hearing that the dog belonged to one of the PMs.</p>

<p>Extremist: A build of Max without the sharing features was released after the project ended, but I can&#39;t find the link now. I think all you could do was view photos.</p>

		<p>For a long time we used to use the names of small towns in rural Utah for our code names. &nbsp;Then someone came up with the idea to use restaurant names in the hopes that the management team would send the project team there for lunch upon completion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That worked well, but now no one will work on the projects named after po-dunk towns for fear they will be sent there for lunch instead.</p>

		<p>And of course, sometimes the &#39;codename&#39; will stick! &nbsp;I worked on an internal tool code named &#39;Espresso&#39;. &nbsp;So of course, when we shipped, we called it&#8230; &#39;Espresso&#39;. &nbsp;Nobody could be bothered to come up with a &#39;real&#39; name!</p>
<p>As far as I know the tools is still in use, but was renamed for V4 into something boring.</p>

		<p>@Hotchin: The same thing happened where I work. My company was developing a tool for monitoring breakages in our build system, which had been affectionately codenamed &#39;Terry&#39;, after Terry Tate (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzToNo7A-94" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a>). There was some consternation that this probably wasn&#39;t an appropriate name for a finished product, but the damage was done. That&#39;s what it&#39;s called to this day.</p>

		<p>I have a rule, called &quot;Lippert&#39;s Rule For Naming Products&quot; which is that management is allowed to change the name of my product *once per version*. If they change it twice, *they* can be the people who scrub the source code looking for stray instances of the now-forbidden string. I did it once, I&#39;m not gonna do it again. I instituted this rule after &quot;Windows Script Thingies&quot; because &quot;Windows Scriptlets&quot; became &quot;Windows Script Components&quot; in the space of a couple of days; the rule has served me well since then. &nbsp;(And I know what you mean about monstrosities, having worked on &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005 Tools For Microsoft Office System 2003&quot; or whatever the heck VSTO&#39;s formal name was. It had &quot;Microsoft&quot; in it *twice* for heaven&#39;s sake.)</p>

		<p>mrod, Max required the online service and with it shut down, it was dead. I don&#39;t remember any build released that worked without the then non-existant service.</p>

		<p>How appropriate.. Windows Embedded Compact 7 (WinCE 7, for those who keep trying to figure out the name lineage (&quot;Windows Embedded&quot; sounds great, until you run into Compact, Mobile (Handheld?), Standard, Enterprise and Server, which mean CE, WinMo and XP/7&#8230;) shipped today, codenamed &quot;Chelan&quot;.</p>
<p>Raymond&#39;s timing is uncannily impeccable again.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the problems with codenames per version is you&#39;re dependent on a table to map the name to a version, and some are known better by their number, others by name. And when the official pages delete the codename, that mapping can get lost. And then your customers will ask for support&#8230; either by version or name, usually the one you&#39;re least familiar with.</p>

		<p>Our MSFT product has gone through 3 name changes in several weeks. One of the devs grew tired of it, and created an official &quot;productname.sed&quot;, with little sed scripts replacing it everywhere it appears.</p>

		<p>Strange that the only two single-letter code names should be M and Q. Sounds like something straight out of 007.</p>

		<p>I worked on Max. It was indeed named after somebody&#39;s dog.</p>

		<p>Neil &#8211; one of the reasons &quot;Q&quot; appealed to me was Q was the gadget guy in Bond and Windows Home Server is a gadget&#8230;</p>

		<p>I can&#39;t help but picture the Milkshake mascot as &quot;Master Shake&quot; from Aqua Teen Hunger Force. &nbsp;I&#39;m kind of hoping this really was the logo.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Shake" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Master_Shake</a></p>
<p>For those not familiar with the show or the character, I guess wikipedia&#39;s description of &quot;acerbic manner&quot; captures it well enough. &nbsp;Definitely not your first choice for corporate mascot.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
