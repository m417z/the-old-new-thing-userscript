<p>Icons are all multiples of eight pixels in width. It's not just because computer people like powers of two.</p>
<p> Back in the early days of Windows, video cards were monochrome or, if you were lucky, 16-color. These were all planar video modes, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/01/273018.aspx"> the mechanics of which were discussed earlier</a>. Now imagine copying a bitmap to the screen where both the bitmap and the screen are planar. If the starting coordinates of the destination was an exact multiple of eight, then the bitmap could be copied via block transfer instructions. On the other hand, if the destination was not a perfect multiple of eight, you had to do a lot of fancy bit shifting to get it onto the screen. </p>
<p> This is the source of the <code>CS_BYTEALIGNCLIENT</code> window class style. With this style set, the window manager will try to position the window so that the x-coordinate of the client rectangle's upper left corner sits at a perfect byte boundary of video memory. If you were running at a 1bpp video mode (monochrome or 16 color), this meant that the x-coordinate was a multiple of eight. By positioning the window this way, a bitmap copied to the upper left corner of the client rectangle would be copied via fast block transfer instructions. </p>
<p> If you look at dialog box dimensions from Windows&nbsp;95 or earlier, you'll find that they are nearly always a multiple of 32 DLUs in width. Since four horizontal DLUs equal one average character width, you had to keep your dialog width a multiple of 32 to ensure that the final dialog size was a multiple of eight. </p>
<p> Keeping bitmap widths such that they represented exact byte boundaries was important for performance on the machines of the day. Copying blocks of pixels around was typically performed in three major steps: A thin vertical strip from the left edge of the bitmap to the first byte boundary, then the bulk of the bitmap up to the last byte boundary, and finally a  thin vertical strip from the last byte boundary to the right edge. If you kept your eyes open, you could actually see these three stages of drawing occurring. (Like I said, machines of the day weren't all that fast.) Keeping things byte aligned and at byte width meant that the two thin vertical strips had zero width and therefore could be optimized out. </p>
<p> Of course, in today's world of 32bpp displays, all these old considerations are largely irrelevant. </p>

		<p>A lot of the old planar memory modes were not actually planar.  The video card just represented them that way.  The innovativeness of several graphics programmers led to Modes like X and Z which were definitely nonplanar but performed very well.</p>
<p>In addition, anything over 64kb had to be panned under 16 bit operating systems due to memory limits.  DOS usually could address 20 bits worth of memory or 1 megabyte.  This was stored in two registers both 16 bits.  One was a segment and the other was the offset.  The segment was shifted 4 bits and added to the offset.</p>
<p>The problem was that this algorithm actually allowed for more than 20 bits of memory resulting in inconsistent results between earlier and later x86 processors.  Intel patched this but this phenomena lead to the High Memory Area.</p>
<p>Those were fun days ;)</p>

		<p>Nowadays, 4, 8, or 16 byte alignment for mmx and sse is what&#8217;s important for game and video processing, though that&#8217;s an edge case compared to system icons. With aligned sse2 access some filters can double or triple their processing speed by eliminating all those extra pixel fixups, when memory and cache bandwidth are the crucial bottlenecks.</p>

		<p>Paul: screen resolution aren&#8217;t constrained by Windows, it&#8217;s all about the video driver</p>
<p>For instance, VMware comes with optimized video drivers for Windows guests, and from version 5 they support arbitrary resolutions automatically adjusted to fill the VMware window</p>

		<p>Re: screen resolutions<br />
<br />Screen resulutions are dictated by the physical proportions of monitors. Most (all?) monitors have a with to height ratio of 4:3. Video modes that follow these proportions (640&#215;480, 800&#215;600, 1024&#215;768, etc) have a square aspect ratio, which means that a square drawn on the screen will appear square. Under non square aspect modes, one side will appear longer, even though the number of pixels is the same.<br /></p>

<p>Actually, you can set your Windows icon widths to any value between 16 and 72 (or 128 if you edit the registry). It&#8217;s under Display Properties &gt; Appearance &gt; Icon. I have mine set to 64px with lots of custom icons taken from the internet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not a well tested feature. Windows uses a terribly ugly resizing algorithm, and it always scales up instead of down when given a choice (so if the *.ico has a 48&#215;48 and a 128&#215;128, 64&#215;64 will look awful). If you really want an unorthodox icon size, you&#8217;ll want to get a tool like <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.axialis.com/iconworkshop/" rel="nofollow">http://www.axialis.com/iconworkshop/</a> and manually resize all the icons you want to it.

<p>Apple specifies that you should create 16&#215;16, 32&#215;32 and 128&#215;128 versions of your icons. Like Windows, the OS will accomodate other sizes, but you won&#8217;t get the best results.</p>

		<p>While most displays are 4:3 there are quite a few that are not. My LCD is 5:4 and there&#8217;s a lot being manufactured at 16:9 and other widescreen ratios. And there&#8217;s a lot of programs (mostly games but some video codecs do it too) that are &quot;smart&quot; and adjust their drawing assuming your display is 4:3 no matter what your resolution.</p>

<p>So do icons snap to multiple-of-8 offsets when you drag them to the desktop?  Are all menus and windows aligned these days so that your icons will be at the proper offset?

<p>How many people use black-and-white bitmapped displays these days anyway?</p>
<p>It may be true that if you are using modern 3d graphics cards, having a multiple-of-two icon size will let it be mapped as a texture more easily which can improve performance if you are using the 3d accelerator to render your 2-d display.

		<p>&quot;On the other hand, if the destination was not a perfect multiple of eight, you had to do a lot of fancy bit shifting to get it onto the screen.&quot;</p>
<p>Not to mention you would have to read from video memory, a huge performance hit, in order to combine the bit patterns.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 8 bits, not 8 pixels. On screens with a colour depth of 8-bit (256 colours) or more (i.e. everything these days) it has no effect, since that would be less then one pixel.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the code was no longer present, as less them 256 colours hasn&#8217;t been supported for along time.</p>

<p>&gt; Back in the early days of Windows</p>
<p>But by the time Windows 3 came out (if not earlier), Microsoft already knew that the number of horizontal DLUs per average character width varied by country, right?</p>
<p>&gt; If you look at dialog box dimensions from<br />
  <br />&gt; Windows 95 or earlier, you&#8217;ll find that they<br />
  <br />&gt; are nearly always a multiple of 32 DLUs in<br />
  <br />&gt; width.</p>
<p>Fortunately Windows 2000, XP, and 2003 allowed the user to resize many dialog boxes that used to be fixed size, so in this era the user would be able to get all of the text displayed and read.  Do you know why Vista has taken a giant step backwards?  I don&#8217;t know if the sizes in Vista are multiples of 32 DLUs but the sizes have reverted to being fixed, with no way for the user to view the entire contents.

<p>Yes. POS systems nowadays in place like supermarkets still uses 9-inch monochrome CRTs because they&#8217;re cheap and they fit their need.</p>
<p>OS developer should take care every hardware that are still in use by lots of people at the time of release, or they just can&#8217;t be justified to get them updated.<br /></p>

		<p>You are kidding, right Norman? Vista doesn&#8217;t allow resizing of it&#8217;s dialogs? If this is still around after the betas it will surely be the worst UI design choice I&#8217;ve seen from the Windows team in ten years. I&#8217;ve come to expect a much higher standard than that.</p>
<p>(The Office team however, is another story alltogether. Remember when Word 97 had a custom-made Open/Save-dialog that didn&#8217;t allow resizes? You could only display 8-10 files at once, which meant finding the right file to open could take 30 seconds if you had many documents in the folder. What amazed me most was that they had actually taken the time to design something that had less functionality than the standard dialog that they could have gotten for free. I would have been furious if I was on the Windows team.)</p>

<p>Office 97 was made when Windows 95 was current, therefore the system dialogs were still fixed size too. It wasn&#8217;t until Windows 98 (SE?) when they became resizable.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not kidding.  I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it if I hadn&#8217;t tried it.  Since I have an MSDN subscription at present I was able to use the beta bug submission tool to point them to a few screenshots, but who knows if they&#8217;ll read or care.</p>
<p>Actually I was amazed that the owner of this blog didn&#8217;t pounce on them before I did.  Even though this isn&#8217;t a .Net blog, I&#8217;d have thought Mr. Chen would be pretty outraged by this absurd destruction of the user interface.</p>

		<p>Screen resolution: 640&#215;480, 800&#215;600, 1024&#215;768&#8230; Why do video drivers generally restrict us to these sizes?  You might want to keep the aspect ratio of 4:3 (or 16:9) the same, but let me pick one of the dimensions, so I can have&#8230; 900xwhatever, or 1100xwhatever.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
