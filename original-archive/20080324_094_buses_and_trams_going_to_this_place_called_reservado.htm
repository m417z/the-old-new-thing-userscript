<p>One thing I noticed in Lisbon is that I will occasionally see a bus or tram whose destination sign says <i>Reservado</i>. I couldn't find a place called <i>Reservado</i> anywhere in my guide book. It must be new.</p>
<p> Hi, everybody. I'm back from vacation, and it's taken me a while to catch up on all that happened while I was away. In addition to deleting all the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/02/18/7761978.aspx"> trackbacks from scraper blogs</a>, I deleted two comments that could get me fired, but I left most of the off-topic discussion because it didn't appear to get too out of control. I even let stand Yuhong Bao's multiple violations of the anti-spam policy (posting multiple comments to the same article in rapid succession). I removed the discussion of managed shell extensions since it had absolutely nothing to do with dragging a virtual file. (And because most of it was wrong anyway.) </p>
<p> I did not delete Igor Levicki's comments, even though he accuses me of doing it. The software that runs this Web site has a set of heuristics (the details of which I am not familiar with since I don't actually run the Web site) which auto-rejects comments which, in the opinion of the heuristics, are spam or offensive. For example, <a href="http://adarsha.mv.googlepages.com"> mvadu</a>'s attempts to post a comment was repeatedly rejected by the filter, but he eventually figured out what the filter was objecting to and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/03/12/8080101.aspx#8174173"> came up with something that kept the filter happy</a>. </p>
<p> Similarly, Igor Levicki's <a href="http://www.levicki.net/articles/blogments/2008/03/14/Pre-emptive_Raymond_Chen_comment_-_Igor_Levicki_sucks.php"> complaint that I ignored his first comment</a> has a very simple non-malicious explanation: I didn't respond because I was on vacation. (If you don't respond to something you never saw, does that count as ignoring it?) But of course, he made this remark in full knowledge that it was completely unfair, because he <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/03/07/8080064.aspx"> posted a comment on the very entry that announced that I would be away</a> and that the Web site would be running on autopilot. </p>
<p> And Igor and gb, I'm sorry you found the drag and drop series boring. If you go back through the archives, you'll see that the first major topic of discussion when I started this Web site was a twelve-part series on scroll bars. How much more boring can you get than scroll bars! </p>
<p> I wrote the drag and drop series because many customers came to us with problems that were the result of failing to understand how to drag virtual content. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/09/18/4966024.aspx"> The only thing they knew how to do</a> was <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/03/19/8080215.aspx"> drag files around</a>, and they were trying to use files as proxies for virtual content. If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. </p>
<p> Many of these programming series are written for selfish reasons: So that I have to explain something only one more time. </p>

		<p>Since I can&#8217;t edit my previous post, I&#8217;ll just have to make a new one.</p>
<p>Raymond: Do you find that writing these things out actually helps? &nbsp;In my experience, you can write as much you can want, but you can&#8217;t make people to read. &nbsp;I can&#8217;t tell you how many people have told me they plain hate reading, a position I cannot understand at all.</p>
<p>[Note: Not everybody hates reading. &nbsp;There are those who are interested in the knowledge, but more often than not it is the decision makers (or at least those people whose opinions matter) who refuse to read.]</p>

		<p>Reservado must be near the town of Ausfahrt that many have trouble locating on German maps.</p>

		<p>I hope you figured out what the Reservado trams were up to! &nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be interesting to get on one, and see what kind of private event or mystery destination they take you to&#8230;</p>

		<p>I guess the &quot;Reservado&quot; was meant as a joke, but here goes the explanation: &quot;Reservado&quot; means that the bus, tram or train is not in service because it is moving to its intended route from the depot, or at the end of the service it is moving to the depot.</p>
<p>Greetings from Lisbon :-) I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed your stay here!</p>

		<p>Tom, Several of Raymond&#8217;s posts have certainly helped me, either because I remembered reading them or found them (older ones I had not read yet) via a web search when trying to work things out.</p>
<p>Of course, you&#8217;re more likely to receive a question from someone who look properly than you are to receive a thank-you note from someone who looked and found your pre-made answer. I know that&#8217;s the case with some of the FAQs I&#8217;ve put on the web. Sometimes I wonder why I waste my time writing them when &quot;nobody reads them,&quot; but in reality they do get read by a lot of people and you can never completely reduce the &quot;can&#8217;t be bothered to look&quot; crowd.</p>
<p>(Not to mention those who do look but fail to find through no fault of their own; e.g. different choice of language/keywords.)</p>

		<p>Why not disable external trackbacks? I don&#8217;t see a point in them. People come to your site to read about you, not follow the discussion.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait until the whole web 2.0 idea that &quot;users generate valuable content&quot; eventually gets seen as ridiculously idealistic. Some users do&#8230;others waste everyone else&#8217;s time.</p>

		<p>Actually I found this DnD tutorial really interesting and I really want to try but I get stuck when trying to compile a COM component. Do I really have to load the entire Visual Studio just to get a couple of missing binaries so I can use the Platform SDK? According to the Mingw32 FAQ, only the MSVC compiler is capable of compiling COM components.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just trying to write some Win32/64 software that gets things right according to the (partially) written rules/recommendations from msdn and those put forth by raymond and his fellow blogging colleagues.</p>

		<p>Got to say I agree with some of the other people here. Is it really worth arguing with an unemployed &quot;assembler expert&quot; from a rapidly shrinking country on the fringes of Europe? It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s any danger of Microsoft offering him a job anymore, so you&#8217;re not likely to run into him in the corridor. Why not just ignore him?</p>

		<p>Raymond said: &quot;I didn&#8217;t respond because I was on vacation.&quot;</p>
<p>But you did answer to my first comment in that post here:</p>

<p>I coulnd&#8217;t have known at which point you stopped checking your blog so I assumed you are either still at home/work or you have Internet access at the place you were staying during your vacation. That is why I posted another comment there, in hope that you will see it.</p>
<p>Raymond said: &quot;I&#8217;m sorry you found the drag and drop series boring.&quot;</p>
<p>Hey, no need to apologize, it is your blog after all.</p>
<p>Even though that particular drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop subject was a bit boring to me you could have noticed so far that I usually refrain myself from making such useless comments.</p>
<p>Truth to be told I included that sentence in my blogment just as an excuse to link to your latest article where I wanted pingback to appear.</p>
<p>I otherwise enjoy reading your blog as you perhaps noticed by my sometimes hyper-active commenting and (sometimes baseless) arguing.</p>
<p>I will edit my blogment to include your clarification about censoring/filtering.</p>
<p>@Scott Yost, Adrian:</p>
<p>I am not a troll, thank you. You two on the other hand act as if you have the moral right and proper knowledge to judge the others.</p>
<p>Anon said: &quot;Is it really worth arguing with an unemployed &quot;assembler expert&quot; from a rapidly shrinking country on the fringes of Europe?&quot;</p>
<ol>
<li>I am not unemployed.</li>
<li>
<p>I am an &quot;assembler expert&quot; just without those quotes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will ignore the shrinking comment for now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The country I happen to live in does not determine who I am. Of course, any person with a brain would know that.</p>

<p>Anon said: &quot;It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s any danger of Microsoft offering him a job anymore&quot;</p>
<p>Has it perhaps crossed your tiny mind that I would never accept such an offer?</p>
<p>Anon said: &nbsp;&quot;so you&#8217;re not likely to run into him in the corridor. Why not just ignore him?&quot;</p>
<p>As if I would ever resort to violence to prove my point?</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t you just crawl back into your corner and continue chewing that plaster?</p>

		<p>I wonder what has become of this blog nowadays. Is it necessary to publish a blog post which, for the most part, consists of showing up individuals that posted certain comments on this site? Why not just ignore them? I can only speak for myself when I say that I&#8217;m not actually not interested in reading how your personal &quot;dispute&quot; with the likes of Igor runs along&#8230;who cares if there are people out there who found the D&amp;D series boring? No one is forced to read this blog after all. I can&#8217;t deny that I&#8217;m under the impression that over time, these comments get to you. Really, just disable comments then.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I love your blog. You can even use it in Google queries like &lt;hmodule oldnewthing&gt;, &lt;&quot;dc brush&quot; oldnewthing&gt; and get useful information back.</p>
<hr />
<p>Und obwohl mir bewusst ist, dass dies dein persoenliches Blog ist, waere ich doch sehr dafuer, kuenftig die oeffentlichen Anprangerungen etwas herunterzufahren &#8211; es mag zwar augenscheinlich sehr subtil sein, die Leute fuehelen sich aber dennoch angegriffen (ganz abgesehen davon, dass andere Leser in dieselbe Kerbe schlagen und ebenfalls ihre Meinung ueber die Betroffenen kundtun).</p>

		<p>Igor, I thought you were going away? Not that I don&#8217;t mind you, but you have this giant chip on your shoulder. You provide almost no constructive comments, and constantly bash people and things on this blog. This is why people want you to leave. Like Raymond has said, this isn&#8217;t a bash Vista blog. This isn&#8217;t a bash Microsoft blog, and you continue to do this.</p>

		<p>I hope you enjoyed Lisboa &#8211; it seems the town is very polarizing.</p>

		<p>My wife and I always joke about the &quot;Nicht Einsteigen&quot;* destination to be found on some trams, buses, and trains in German speaking countries.</p>
<p>Once, having fallen asleep on the last train, I found myself in a place which must indeed be the aforementioned Nicht Einsteigen &#8211; a big yard full of trains. Guess the driver missed me when he went around checking.</p>
<p>* Basically &quot;do not get on&quot;</p>

<p>I was just being polite and replied to Raymond who was addressing me personally.</p>

		<p>Reservado is commonly used for &quot;Not for public use&quot;. Those buses are reserved to a specific group of people and usually only have a pick up point and drop off point, so you wouldn&#8217;t be able &nbsp;to get on. Buses and trams going to the depot usually say &quot;Fora de Servi&#231;o&quot; which means &quot;Out of Service&quot;.</p>

		<p>Yep, could&#8217;ve sworn Igor announced his departure a while back.</p>
<p>Still, I mainly read this blog for the soap opera that develops in the comments, so I&#8217;m not totally unhappy he&#8217;s back (except that he upsets Raymond, which isn&#8217;t cool).</p>

		<p>@Vlad</p>
<p>hear hear! I often compulsively search for Raymond&#8217;s responses in the comment sections. Those are some of the best reads in this blog.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
