<p>Somebody with a rude name wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/09/20/10351107.aspx#10351587"> what the <code>SEE_<wbr>MASK_<wbr>UNICODE</wbr></wbr></code> flag does</a>.</p>
<p> It does nothing. </p>
<p> The flag was introduced when porting the Windows&nbsp;95 shell to Windows&nbsp;NT. It happened <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/09/12/10348441.aspx"> further back in history than I have permission to access the Windows source code history database</a>, but I can guess how it got introduced. </p>
<p> One of the things that the porting team had to do was make Unicode versions of all the ANSI functions that Windows&nbsp;95 created. Sometimes this was done by <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762153(v=vs.85).aspx"> creating separate A and W versions of a function</a>. Sometimes this was done by <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb774950(v=vs.85).aspx"> having separate A and W versions of an interface</a>. Sometimes by <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb773217(v=vs.85).aspx"> adding additional fields to the A version of a structure</a> with a flag that says whether the ANSI or Unicode members should be used. </p>
<p> My guess is that the porting team initially decided to make <code>Shell&shy;Execute&shy;Ex</code> use that third model, where the <code>SHELL&shy;EXECUTE&shy;INFO</code> structure had a <code>SHELL&shy;EXECUTE&shy;INFO&shy;EX</code> extension with Unicode strings, and the mask specified whether the caller preferred you to use the ANSI strings or the Unicode strings. </p>
<p> Presumably they decided to change course and switch to having separate <code>SHELL&shy;EXECUTE&shy;INFOA</code> and <code>SHELL&shy;EXECUTE&shy;INFOW</code> structures. But when they switched from one model to the other, they left that flag behind, probably with the intention of removing it once all existing callers had been updated to stop passing the flag, but <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/25/5658731.aspx"> they never managed to get around to it</a>. </p>
<p> So the flag is just sitting in the header file even though nobody pays any attention to it. </p>

		<p>This post is intereesting, though what interests me more is the original post (comment) was made nearly one and a half years ago. In all that time no one stumbled across the question and posted an answer. Even more interesting, is knowing Raymond&#39;s system of having a queue of posts over a year long makes me wonder if Raymond&#39;s answer was written a year and a half ago and only just now emerged.</p>

		<p>I wonder if, a hundred years from now, Microsoft will ressurrect the source code for the pre-2000 versions of MS-Windows and MS-DOS and donate them to a museum. Major versions of MS-Windows are important cultural artefacts of our era, and it would be good to be able to look back to the days when the computing landscape of the future was shaped and understand the reasons behind the decisions which will have left their mark on the whole of humanity.</p>

		<p>@Cesar</p>
<p>Right. Like we keep in a museum the source code of mainstreams from the 60&#39;s. Ever wondered to look at their OS&#39;s? Me neither. The future will say &quot;You had to use fingers on a keyboard to type?&quot; as same way we do to our fathers &quot;You had to punch holes in papers to make it compute?&quot;. And remember, Apollo missions were all based on those punch holes!.</p>

		<p>@voo: Yea, as mentioned in the other thread, I think it is the move from SLM to SourceDepot, which AFAIK was done just before Win2000 RTMed.</p>

		<p>@Danny, there&#39;s a whole bunch of people who call themselves &quot;computer archeologists&quot; and who absolutely love looking at old software, often with a special interest towards (but certainly not limited to) operating systems. And there already are museums of that kind, although because of the nature of software, most of them are accessed online rather than physically. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://os2museum.com">http://os2museum.com</a> is one example (don&#39;t be fooled by the name, it&#39;s far far more than OS/2 and given the apparent ratio of OS/2 to non-OS/2 stuff, by now I suspect that the name is just a relict). The Computer History Museum in Mountain View, on the other hand, is an example for a big and hugely popular museum that does host all kinds of older systems. Granted, it&#39;s mostly the physical machines, but they do have some software and some restored machines with (presumably) their original operating systems.</p>
<p>Funny story, I started my computer archeology back when I was a little kid. My father&#39;s PC had the then recent MS-DOS 5.0 on it and I got a huge kick out of installing DOS 2.11 on a floppy disk and looking at the differences. Nowadays I install PC/IX and Xenix 86 in emulators.</p>
<p>So, yes, as Cesar says, I absolutely think that yesterday&#39;s operating systems will be important cultural artifacts in the future, at least for some subset of humanity.</p>

		<p>Windows 2000 was developer in SLM, the Source Depot transition happened right after it. Presumably, the transition included some form of history, but maybe that got archived in order to keep the size of the depots maintainable.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
