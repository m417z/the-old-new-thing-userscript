<p>Cellist Joshua Roman has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/11/2079141.aspx"> quite a dedicated following here in Seattle</a>, but those Joshua Roman groupies may have to dust off their frequent flyer cards, because the young cellist is <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/thearts/2004154757_roman31.html"> resigning his position at the end of the season in order to pursue a solo career</a>.</p>
<p> There has been quite a bit of turmoil at the Seattle Symphony in recent years. The former concertmaster <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/classical/220097_ssoconcertmaster.html"> was forced out</a>, <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/classical/224521_talvi17.html"> leaving bitter feelings behind</a>, and <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002213706_concertmaster20.html"> the long search for a replacement</a> concluded with not one, not two, but <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/thearts/2003900131_concertmaster25.html"> four permanent concertmasters</a> who will divide the leadership duties among themselves. A lawsuit filed by a violinist claiming "<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/classical/263313_orch17.html">intentional emotional distress arising out of the hostile environment and harassment ... over a long and extended period of time</a>" <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/arts/music/16waki.html"> tickled the interest of <i>The New York Times</i></a> in late 2007 (and generated a number of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/arts/30letters.html"> letters to the editor in response</a>), although for us locals, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003305424_symphonyproblems15.html"> it's old news</a>. (<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004145991_websymphony26.html">The lawsuit was dismissed</a> in early 2008.) </p>
<p> Makes you wonder how they find time to play music. </p>

		<p>I wonder how much Roman&#8217;s departure will hurt ticket sales? &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Rumor has it that this was his plan all along, but he omitted to tell the orchestra until after he had secured the first chair.</p>
<p>What little I&#8217;ve heard him and heard of him is a one-trick pony: all elegance and detached precision. Combine him with Gerard Schwarz&#8217;s son Julian and you&#8217;ve got yourself a cellist.</p>
<p>Looking around the auditorium I suspect it won&#8217;t hurt ticket sales for the major symphony series. I&#8217;m not there to hear improvements in the elegance-detachment factor of the cello section and I can barely see his mop from my seat.</p>

		<p>Too bad about Joshua, but he&#8217;s gotta go where he wants to go.</p>
<p>Julian&#8217;s not bad as a cellist. He has room to grow, but he&#8217;s doing a decent job. Give him another 10 years and let&#8217;s see how he grows.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
