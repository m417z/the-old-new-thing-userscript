<p>
A customer had a dialog box with two large text controls.
Something like this:
</p>
<pre>
IDD_DIALOG_WELCOME DIALOGEX 0, 0, 305, 280  
STYLE DS_MODALFRAME | WS_POPUP | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU  
FONT 8, "MS Shell Dlg", 400, 0, 0x0  

BEGIN  
ICON   IDI_MAIN, -1, 0, 0
LTEXT  "Contoso Deluxe 2.0", 10, 0, 300, 24
LTEXT  "Check out all the new stuff in this version.",
       -1, 13, 17, 290, 20  
ICON   IDI_WHATSNEW_EFFECTS, -1, 13, 45
LTEXT  "New effects", -1, 43, 45, 270, 20  
LTEXT  "The super-blaster effect now blasts twice as \
much as the old blaster. Blast away with all your might!",
       -1, 43, 60, 225, 50  
ICON   IDI_WHATSNEW_STYLES, -1, 13, 115
LTEXT  "New styles", -1, 43, 115, 240, 20  
CONTROL  "", IDC_WHATSNEW_STYLES_PLACEMENT, "Static",
       SS_OWNERDRAW, 43, 131, 225, 87
END  
</pre>
<p>
The "super-blaster" text is rather long,
but at least it fits under 255 characters,
which is the limit for static text controls.
The text that goes into the
<code>IDC_<wbr>WHATS&shy;NEW_<wbr>STYLES_<wbr>PLACEMENT</code>
control is longer than 255 characters,
so the dialog creates a RichEdit control at runtime,
places it where the
<code>IDC_<wbr>WHATS&shy;NEW_<wbr>STYLES_<wbr>PLACEMENT</code>
control goes,
and fills the RichEdit with the required text.
</p>
<p>
The problem the customer had was that no matter how hard they
tried, they couldn't get the RichEdit control to look the same
as the static text control.
In particular, they couldn't get the line spacing to match up,
which results in an ugly inconsistency within the dialog box.
</p>
<p>
Their question was "How do I get this RichEdit control to look
just like a static control?"
</p>
<p>
This is another case of
<a HREF="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node=XY+Problem">
an XY problem</a>.
The customer has a problem X:
"I have some text that is too long to go into a static control."
And the customer has an idea for a solution Y:
"I know!
I'll use a RichEdit control instead of a static control,
and then I'll make the RichEdit control visually indistinguishable
from a static control."
The customer then asks for help with Y,
when their real problem is X.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, since the customer explained their entire scenario,
we got to see what X is, and the solution to X doesn't involve
a RichEdit control at all.
</p>
<p>
What the customer can do is change the last 
control to a plain text control:
</p>
<pre>
LTEXT  "", IDC_WHATSNEW_STYLES_TEXT,
       43, 131, 225, 87
</pre>
<p>
And then instead of
creating a RichEdit control at runtime,
positioning it, and filling it with text,
they simply fill the
<code>IDC_<wbr>WHATS&shy;NEW_<wbr>STYLES_<wbr>TEXT</code>
with the text.
</p>
<p>
The 255-character limit the customer observed
is a limit of the resource
compiler, not a limit of the static text control itself.
The static text control will take as much text as you give it.</p>

		<p>Well, I can understand the confusion here though. I couldn&#8217;t find any kind of mention of a limit even with the resource compiler documentation. Of course, I could just be failing here.<br />
Anyway, you try to do something and you run into a problem, if there is no documentation available telling you that there is a limitation in the tools you are using then it is easier to assume that the problem is in the underlying implementation. It is especially true since there is no documentation saying that the static text control doesn&#8217;t have a limit. So from the developer&#8217;s point of view, both the resource compiler and static text control limits are implementation defined.</p>

		<p>Yep&#8230; this is one of those cases where the customer is quite legitimately trying to work around a bug in the tools, and it&#8217;s not unreasonable that they might have assumed the limit was in the text control, not the resource file&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Simon, what bug? To me, it&#8217;s like a customer who wants to buy gas up front using a 2gal gas can, but wants their car to behave as it the entire 10gal tank was filled and didn&#8217;t realize they could just buy 10gal cans. Customer ignorance is not a bug in the tool.</p>

		<p>The tool limitation is the resource compiler. But they didn&#8217;t realize that they didn&#8217;t need to switch to an entire new control. To take your analogy, it&#8217;s like a customer who wants 10 gallons of gas in their Camry but have only a 2 gallon can. To fix this, they buy a Prius, because the Prius has a 10-gallon tank, and they buy a 10 gallon can. But the Prius doesn&#8217;t look the same as a Camry, and they want help to make the Prius look more like a Camry. What they didn&#8217;t realizes is that the Camry also has a 10 gallon tank. They didn&#8217;t need to buy a Prius at all. All they needed to do was buy a 10 gallon can for their Camry.</p>

		<p>This may be down to the fact that the packed resource format uses Pascal-style length-counted strings rather than C-style null-terminated strings (see <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040130-00/?p=40813" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040130-00/?p=40813</a>) and these would have been limited to 255 bytes in ANSI.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
