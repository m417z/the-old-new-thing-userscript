		<p>@Maurits, did you <em>read the</em> article? An employee acting against Microsoft policy is not &quot;Microsoft itself&quot;, and he specifically mentions the possibility of malicious insiders.</p>
<p>Since you didn&#8217;t read the article, I don&#8217;t find your opinion on the arguments presented in the article compelling.</p>

		<p>Maurits, if you had understood the article, you would know that hashing doesn&#8217;t protect privacy. Figuring out who you are based on what URLs you visit is not likely to be easier than figuring out what URLs you visit based on the hashes you send.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any phisher could just add a random component to the URL and be able to make unique hashes to evade detection. So not only does sending hashes not prevent abuse of the information, but it makes the whole system useless by being trivial to circumvent.</p>

		<p>MS is making up excuses for retrieving the full url, this is not a unsolvable problem IF YOU WANT. At least the protocol and the domain/site/ipnumber part of the url could be hashed.</p>

		<p>What&#8217;s the point of hashing?</p>
<p>So instead of reporting you went to <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com</a>, it reports you went to 0x7e1b567a?</p>
<p>Since anti-phishing requires known sites, then hashing requires the bad URL. Well, it&#8217;s trivial when storing the hashes to store the original URL that goes with it (say, a more efficient lookup method is found). Oh wait, when we ;og the hash, we can translate it to the real URL too! It&#8217;s just another column in the database, so it comes &quot;for free&quot;.</p>
<p>Also makes it hard to do similarity matches. If bankofamerica.example.com is bad, maybe bankofamerica.example.net is too?</p>

		<p>Of course, the <em>real</em> problem with the argument is that the sort of attacker that most people are worried about aren&#8217;t necessarily going to be the kind that need to &quot;confirm that you&#8217;ve been to a specific site&quot; as he assumes.</p>
<p>Another possibility would be to have the client download a massive list of bad urls (or a section of it &#8211; maybe all the &quot;g&quot;&#8217;s) every time you visit a website, or as part of a periodic update.</p>
<p>Of course, another possibility is that we shouldn&#8217;t all be having this discussion on Raymond Chen&#8217;s blog when he didn&#8217;t write the article.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
