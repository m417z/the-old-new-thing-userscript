		<p>(I thought this might have been plagiarised, because I knew I&#8217;d read it before, but it turned out to just be a widely-linked piece from 2005, talking about the <em>last</em> Fantastic Four movie.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been more annoyed by the various toy <em>Superman</em> vehicles, which are even more ridiculous than an ATV for the Human Torch.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right &#8211; Supes can fly to the moon in a few seconds and doesn&#8217;t need a spacesuit once he gets there, but apparently he does still need a poorly-painted motorcycle from Guangzhao while he&#8217;s down here.</p>
<p>Every comics reader knows, of course, that on the occasions when Supes loses his powers, he has a Fortress of Solitude with a number depending on the writer and era of far better vehicles in it.</p>
<p>Not to mention a 100% chance of being able to borrow any of several incredibly badass BatVehicles, or indeed an Invisible Jet, as long as he brings it back with a full tank.</p>

		<p>From the linked article:</p>
<p>&quot;&#8230;but this guy who lives down the block from me is constantly ripping around our neighborhood on one of these stupid four-wheelers&#8211;and without a helmet, no less!&quot;</p>
<p>I think this is a self-solving problem &#8211; this kind of guys ofen apply for Darwin awards.</p>

		<p>I saw a similarly bad toy about a year ago, probably designed by the same company: [url=<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_</a>(comics)]The Flash[/url] on a motorcycle. Yes, apparently the superhero known for his amazing speed sometimes feels the need to drive a motorcycle to the scene of a crime.</p>
<p>What were they thinking?</p>

		<p>The problem is always with the nearly-solved problem. If the guy crashes and doesn&#8217;t manage to kill himself but just goes for the Maim Prize, someone has to scrape him up and do some patching. This is expensive. Why can&#8217;t types like that just take up skydiving without a &#8216;chute and get it over with? *grumble*</p>
<p>Love the article tho. &quot;Children are not idiots. &nbsp;Okay, most of them are idiots.&quot; &#8211; my kind of guy. :-D</p>

		<p>Taschen&#8217;s &#8217;70&#8217;s-advertising &quot;art&quot; book includes an ad (p. 131) for Star Wars toys. Among plastic blasters with &quot;laser&quot; sound, a plastic TIE fighter, a Darth Vader action figure, and similar items are three Star Wars (snap-together) plastic toy vans.</p>
<p>Yes, &quot;now you can have one of the hottest and most exclusive Star Wars products anywhere&quot;&#8211;including glow-in-the-dark decals &quot;for exciting ghostly images of your favorite characters.&quot; Three models: Darth Vader van kit, Luke Skywalker van kit, or Artoo-Detoo [sic] van kit.</p>

		<p>Ok, Human Torch, point taken, yadda yadda. But Spiderman could use an ATV. Doesn&#8217;t anybody remember when he came to Canada (Toronto?) how much he complained about how hard it was to get around with all the low buildings? Imagine if he were REALLY out in the boonies, for sure he&#8217;d need to get around on a vehicle.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
