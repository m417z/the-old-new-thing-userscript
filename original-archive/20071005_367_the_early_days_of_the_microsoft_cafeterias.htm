<p>A tour of Redmond campus cafeterias back in the old days took much less time than <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/09/21/5021766.aspx"> it would require nowadays</a>. Back then, the cafeterias were tiny affairs, the size of maybe three offices not counting the prep area, with a seating capacity of maybe a dozen tables. Each cafeteria had a theme, so going to lunch back in the day was not "Let's go to the nearby mega-cafeteria and decide what we'll have." It was "Let's decide what we'll have, and then go to the mini-cafeteria that is serving it."</p>
<p> Here are the cafeterias on campus back in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miri_%28Star_Trek%29"> The Before Time</a>, along with their specialties: </p>
<ul>
<li>Building 1: <i>Lite Bite</i>.     Low-calorie and vegetarian food. </li>
<li>Building 4: <i>Wild Pizza</i>.     Pizza, a hot entree, and sandwiches made to order. </li>
<li>Building 5: <i>Burger Bar</i>.     The grill, and home of the famous Blibbet Burger. </li>
<li>Building 8: <i>American Fare</i>.     Traditional American food for the meat-and-potatoes kind of guy. </li>
<li>Building 9: <i>International Cuisine</i>.     A different featured country every week. </li>
<li>Building 10: <i>American Fare</i>.     Traditional American food for the meat-and-potatoes kind of guy. </li>
</ul>
<p> All cafeterias had a salad bar, and the cafeterias in buildings 8 through 10 were <i>extra large</i>: In addition to the featured theme, they also had a grill and made sandwiches to order. (It was like three cafeterias in one!) </p>
<p> I myself have never even seen a Blibbet Burger, much less eaten one. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/07/14/438777.aspx"> Larry Osterman has some Blibbet memories</a>, and <a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2006/05/microsoft_dinin.html"> Adam Barr has more cafeteria memories</a>. </p>

		<p>In fact Burgermaster was a pre-programmed speed dial number on the Microsoft&#8217;s Northup Way phone system (pre-Redmond). &nbsp;And then just a few steps through the parking lot and down the steps to pick it up.</p>
<p>The &quot;cafeteria&quot; in the Northup Way building was a nice lady who made sandwiches from a cart on the second floor.</p>

		<p>Speaking of burgermaster and Blibbet Burgers, that sounds a lot like Hardee&#8217;s Monster Burger. &nbsp;Two slabs of burger, three slices of cheese, four strips of bacon on a buttered bun. &nbsp;Just in case you were thinking you might get away with it, it&#8217;s also got mayo.</p>
<p>Damn, I miss those things.</p>

		<p>So, um, now I know why MS has such a good health plan.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
