<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100630-01/?p=13553#comment-844323">someone</a>
wants to know why you cannot run a separate
32-bit instance of Explorer on 64-bit Windows.
This used to work in Windows Vista, but stopped working
in Windows 7.
</p>
<p>
The ability to run a 32-bit instance of Explorer on 64-bit Windows
was a feature in Windows Vista
as a temporary solution in order to get Explorer to show
both 64-bit and 32-bit Control Panel icons.
In Windows Vista, there was a separate Control Panel inside Control Panel
called "View 32-bit Control Panel Icons".
This ran a separate copy of 32-bit Explorer so it could load
the 32-bit Control Panel icons and let you use them.
</p>
<p>
However, this was only a temporary solution.
</p>
<p>
In Windows 7,
the work was done to integrate the 32-bit Control Panel icons
into the main Control Panel,
so you didn't have the 32-bit Control Panel icons hanging out
in some sort of 32-bit ghetto.
In addition to making the Control Panel much prettier,
it also made things much easier for users,
since they didn't have to go digging into two Control Panels
to find the icon they wanted.
</p>
<p>
Once that work was done, a standalone 32-bit copy of Explorer was 
no longer needed,
and the code to support that configuration could be removed.
</p>
<p>
If you were
<a HREF="https://xkcd.com/1172/">
relying on that feature</a>,
well, you're out of luck.
But
earlier this year, I explained how
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170328-00/?p=95845">
you can work around it</a>
and get access to your 32-bit shell extensions.</p>

		<p>But the problem with the new settings is that you can only have one settings pane open at once. Worse, if you right-click Start, Apps and Features, it destroys the settings pane&#8217;s history, so you can&#8217;t even go back to where you were.</p>

		<p>&#8220;the problem with the new settings&#8221; =&gt; &#8220;the problem with the Windows 10  &#8216;PC settings'&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, I also find it a major flaw in the new design.</p>
<p>But I hope all this &#8220;modern UI&#8221; will sometimes go away. It is just unacceptable when even the &#8220;modern&#8221; calculator app is slow to start and first shows you only some white rectangle before it draws its window content for the first time. (It also suffers from the white-on-white design, so it just gives a bad user experience.) If even such a tiny app had major problems with the GUI peformance and the visual representation, there is no future this &#8220;modern UI&#8221; approach.</p>

		<p>32-bit shell extensions are still needed, because things like file open dialogs in 32-bit programs still use them.  A prime example is Visual Studio, so TortoiseGit and TortoiseSVN both install 32-bit shell extensions.</p>

		<p>So, in Windows Vista, 32-bit Control Panel applets weren&#8217;t shown directly in the main Control Panel window and needed a 32-bit window. </p>

		<p>And yet, I am sure a 64-bit window can display icons for 32-bit apps without needing to load 32-bit DLLs into 64-bit processes. That&#8217;s what Windows 7 is doing, right?</p>
<p>But never mind. I now believe my question was redundant. The whole Windows Vista is a big &#8220;why?&#8221; for which there is no answer. (Well, except maybe: Eichenwald, Kurt (August 2012). &#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s Lost Decade&#8221;. <i>Vanity Fair</i>. Condé Nast.)</p>

<p>Well, this is the original reason for which I asked &#8220;why?&#8221; Imagine you are designing a whole operating system from the ground app, introducing such radically different concept such as task flow layout. Well, ditch the old hampering format too. For the panels that don&#8217;t adhere to task flow layout, just launch them with rundll32.exe, or better yet, control32.exe</p>

		<p>Yup, that&#8217;s what we do. Control panel items that follow the old pattern are launched in a 32-bit helper process. But you still have to have 32-bit code to discover the icons in the first place: The old-style control panel interface lets an item decide at run time whether it has an icons, and if so, which ones. Some control panel items, for example, show an icon only if the corresponding hardware is installed, and the kind of icon depends on the kind of hardware.</p>

		<p>Icons usually aren&#8217;t stored in DLLs, so programs like Explorer don&#8217;t need to load DLLs in order to display icons. Control Panel applets (as well as the Control Panel itself) work a little differently. You&#8217;re comparing apples to oranges.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m wondering, why Explorer in OS&#8217;s after the Windows XP stopped supporting custom columns. These were handy for working with SVN, for example &#8211; you could have &#8220;status&#8221; and &#8220;author&#8221; columns and sort by these.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
