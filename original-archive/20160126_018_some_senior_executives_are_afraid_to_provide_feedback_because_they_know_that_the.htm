I recall a conversation I had with Steve Sinofsky,
back when he was in charge of Windows.
As you might expect, he gets to see early versions
of a lot of things,
his laptop is running
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110802-00/?p=10003">
dogfood</a> everything,
and everybody is asking for feedback.
</p>
<p>
And he rarely gives any.&sup1;
</p>
<p>
Not because he's a jerk,
but because he understands that if he provides
any feedback,
it will get magnified
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140715-00/?p=503">
from an idea to a suggestion
to a recommendation to a direct order</a>.&sup2;
</p>
<p>
"Why isn't there a
Frobnicate button right next to the Widget?
The main reason I go to that page is to find a Widget
to frobnicate."
</p>
<p>
This becomes
"Steve wants to add
a Frobnicate button right next to the Widget",
and then
"Steve says we have to add
a Frobnicate button right next to the Widget".
</p>
<p>
I guess, if he is moved to make a suggestion or share an idea,
he can mention it to somebody and add
"Tell the XYZ team, but don't tell them it came from me."
I don't know if that's what he actually does.
</p>
<p>
&sup1; Presumably he gives feedback on the functionality as a whole,
but today I'm talking about feedback on the level of
feature requests or tweaks,
like how the UI should be laid out,
or the order of the pages in a wizard,
or whether a wizard should be used at all.
</p>
<p>
&sup2; I hesitate to mention that at the time Exchange was being
developed, the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> standard
<i>did not yet exist</i>.
Try it: Fire up your archived copy of Windows 95,
launch Notepad or Wordpad or whatever,
and hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>.
Nothing happens.
At the time, the standard hotkey for Find was
<kbd>F3</kbd>.
(And, in fact, many applications today still accept
<kbd>F3</kbd> as a shortcut for Find.)</p>

		<p>When you are in charge of something you are often so far removed from it that you don&#8217;t understand the correct solution to any particular problem. Bad managers will try to use their position to influence decisions as they think they need to justify their salary.</p>

		<p>I suppose the fix is simply to make his feedback through standardized anonymous channels like everyone else. Steve Sinofsky wouldn&#8217;t be the only employee dogfooding everything, and dogfooding implies feedback by definition. The username shouldn&#8217;t really matter.</p>

		<p>Not a bad idea. Frankly, providing feedback from outside the main engineering group is always a perilous prospect, even if you&#8217;re _not_ the head honcho. I still today feel the weight of my perceived responsibility for pushing the Win32 printing API toward its brokenness, due to feedback I provided back in the early 90&#8217;s regarding the problematic way printer drivers were including global data in the document-specific DEVMODE data structure.</p>
<p>Rather than fix it the way I thought they would (i.e. exclude global data from document-specific data structures entirely), they split the API into calls where sometimes you got global data and sometimes you didn&#8217;t. So now we have an API that still (in some cases) stores global data in a document-specific data structure, and is also now harder to understand (because now you have to remember which function to call to get or validate your document-specific data structure, depending on whether you are about to print or about to save the document).</p>
<p>Basically: rather than being closely involved in the design process of the bug fix, I threw a suggestion over the wall and (incorrectly) trusted the receiving team to do the right thing with it.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve come to understand that this occurs a great deal in user-feedback scenarios for software development. It&#8217;s quite unfortunate; software design turns into a sort of &#8220;telephone&#8221; game, where a suggestion goes in one end, and pops out at the other in a completely unrecognizable form.</p>
<p>I can imagine that if an engineering team knows suggestions are coming from the boss, this normal problem just becomes magnified by an order of magnitude or two.</p>

		<p>@Adam,<br />
When F3 is Find Next, it defaults to Find if there is no previous find. I believe for a long time Notepad had no shortcut for Find (F3 for Find Next may or may not have been there, but I don&#8217;t remember it being there).</p>

		<p>Notepad on Windows 95 does have F3 for Find Next, but nothing for Find (although as you say, the first time you press F3, it summons the Find dialog anyway).</p>

		<p>Some while ago, the Soviet ruler was Nikita Khrushchev. Once he was riding in his black limo through a Moscow boulevard, and said to one of his aids : &#8220;this street is narrow&#8221;. In few days, the plans for cutting off all the trees of the boulevard to make it an 8-lane autobahn were prepared. Nobody doubted that this move, aimed to destroy one of the beautiful and historically important city landmarks, could not be stopped.</p>
<p>As the legend goes, there was an old prominent architect, who no longer worked in the office. This brave man said: &#8220;let me only approach Khrushchev, I must tell him that this will be a disaster. I am so old, and sick. If they take me to KGB, I will quickly die in jail&#8221;.</p>
<p>So he arrived to some completely unrelated event where Khrushchev was present, and asked the straightforward question: &#8220;Do you know that turning the Boulevard into an 8-lane freeway is a crime against the history of the city?&#8221; And Khrushchev said &#8220;WHAT?&#8221; And quickly it turned out that all plans and preparations were made without ever checking whether he really meant anything with his matter-of-fact remark.</p>
<p>This legend should be taken to proportion; sure, no senior executive in a major corporation can cause dangers comparable to a Soviet ruler&#8217;s evil will.</p>

		<p>Where I work, developers do not see the name of the beta tester who filed the report. It is deemed an unnecessary violation of privacy. Only Overwatch can tell and she is very tight-lipped. So, if Steve was my boss, he could probably file his report and we would have rejected it without knowing it was his.</p>
<p>As I always say, Microsoft has a lot of room for improvements. A huge lot.</p>

		<p>Where I work, we keep contact information in the ticket, so that &#8212; whether it&#8217;s a fellow employee (of any rank), beta tester or just normal customer &#8212; we can contact them if we have questions about what they want, and ultimately, when there&#8217;s a build available for them that contains the fix, which is not infrequently within a few days. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never heard of anyone complaining that this was an invasion of privacy, but I suppose that may depend on the nature of the software and one&#8217;s customers.</p>

		<p>Oh, we can contact them any time we need. Only we don&#8217;t know who we are talking to. It is like sitting in a conference room where everyone is wearing masks, only not as creepy. Besides privacy, this curbs all kinds of ad hominem treatment, both in favor and against the person.</p>

		<p>Your note (2) says that Ctrl+F didn&#8217;t exist yet, but your linked article says, &#8220;Rewind to 1995.  [&#8230;] Back in those days, the Ctrl+F keyboard shortcut did indeed call up the Find dialog, in accordance with convention.&#8221;  Is it the linked article that was wrong?</p>
<p>I always remember F3 being the convention for Find Next, but Ctrl+F for Find.</p>

		<p>Regarding Ctrl-F, in a danish locale that key is used for bold (called &#8220;fed&#8221; in danish). As a developer used to working with some localized software, and some not so localized (say Word and Visual Studio) this causes endless minor frustration.</p>

		<p>Steve is short for Steven. So while the internet is not wrong, neither is Raymond. Many western names can be shortened:</p>
<p>Chris == Christopher<br />
Jon == Jonathon (note that this is not the same as John, with an h)<br />
Jo == Joanne or Joanna<br />
Joe == Joseph<br />
Ray == Raymond</p>
<p>The key thing is whether the person is OK with you using that form of their name</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not just people in upper management positions, it&#8217;s people whose names are recognised in a field.  If there was some discussion about algorithms and someone called Donald Knuth made a comment about which algorithm to use, it&#8217;d pretty much end the discussion because everyone would assume that Knuth is the ultimate authority on that (which he probably is, actually).</p>
<p>This is why I always post under an alias in the forums I contribute to, if I&#8217;m talking crap I want people to tell me about it, not just assume that it must be good because of the name attached to it.</p>

		<p>And now I am left wondering who &#8220;Dave&#8221; really is.  Solomon? Cutler?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not a Microsoft person (don&#8217;t try guessing :-), but my name is strongly associated with a particular field, which is also the one I comment on the most.</p>
<p>Others use aliases for this reason as well.  The one that springs immediately to mind is lawyers, so they can offer an opinion on a subject without it being taken as legal advice.</p>

		<p>Based on the information on his website, I wouldn&#8217;t expect Donald Knuth to have any time for forums, so the name would probably come off as a joke.</p>

		<p>This might shoot my chance of become an executive. I swear, if I ever get any say as to what happens to Outlook, the highest priority for shipping whatever the next release will be, is having Ctrl+F to be Find instead of Forward. I understand that Ctrl+F makes sense for Forward, but it&#8217;s massively inconsistent with every other program in existence!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
