<p>
You can register a global hotkey with the
<code>Register&shy;Hot&shy;Key</code> function,
but one problem many people have is that if the
user presses and holds the hotkey sequence,
the hotkey will be invoked as fast as auto-repeat
will let it.
For some types of hotkeys, this is not desirable.
How do you prevent this?
</p>
<p>
Starting in Windows 7,
you can pass the
<code>MOD_</code><code>NO&shy;REPEAT</code> flag
to the
<code>Register&shy;Hot&shy;Key</code> function
to tell it not to generate
<code>WM_</code><code>HOT&shy;KEY</code> messages
if the hotkey activation sequences was triggered by autorepeat.
</p>
<p>
The initial press of the hotkey will generate a
<code>WM_</code><code>HOT&shy;KEY</code> message,
but the auto-repeats will not.</p>

		<p>And here I was patching the hotkey dispatch code on the fly in memory. Because turning of hotkeys completely in response to one event is clearly using a global solution for a local problem.</p>

		<p>We *require* the ability to enumerate registered hotkeys by process. That&#8217;s the big problem everyone has with hotkeys that MS never solved: finding out what application stole them.</p>

		<p>MOD_NOREPEAT = 0x4000;</p>
<p>MOD_RIGHT = 0x4000;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the difference here?  There&#8217;s two sets of hotkey flags that share MOD_ALT, MOD_CONTROL, and MOD_SHIFT.</p>

		<p>Today I discovered apparently it&#8217;s a thing to tell other gamers in game to hold down Win+E, which I suppose pre-Win 7 repeatedly spawned Explorer windows. I guess they started catching on that ALT+F4 wasn&#8217;t going to win them the game instantly.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
