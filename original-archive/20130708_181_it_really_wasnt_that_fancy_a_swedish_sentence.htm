<p>I dreamed that I was on vacation with my family at a cabin in the woods. I went downstairs with my elder child, and in the playroom I saw another family who are good friends of ours. I guess they chose to vacation at the same place.</p>
<p> They had hired a Swedish-speaking nanny to help with the kids. The nanny asked me a simple question, and I gave a straightforward answer. "Hon &auml;r den &auml;ldre av mina tv&aring; barn." </p>
<p> The nanny was all so impressed that I was using like super-fancy-pants Swedish grammar. </p>
<p> Spoiler alert: It isn't particularly fancy. </p>

		<p>It looks like a word for word translation of its English equivalent, which definitely is not fancy.</p>

		<p>Do Swedes really use the &quot;&auml;ldre&quot; (older) form when there are two of them, just like in English?</p>
<p>In Norwegian, we use &quot;eldste&quot; (oldest), whether there are two, three or more to be compared, if there are no older one.</p>
<p>Norwegian and Swedish are so closely related that we understand each other without any formal training, but I never noticed this difference between the languages (if it really is so), even though I speak with Swedes regularly. Maybe it is the lack of formal training, the laissez-faire attitude to learning the language, is why I have overlooked it.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t think you need an online translator &#8211; any English speaker should have been able to figure out that sentence in context if they read it aloud (and perhaps also recalling the Scottish word &quot;bairn&quot;).</p>

		<p>I agree with Vlad. I appreciate the translation as it helps me better understand the context of the story.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
