<p>         Hurricane Isabel made a mess of my weekend travel plans, so I decided, "If you can't         beat 'em, join 'em." My outbound flight was cancelled, and even with the best possible         substitution - a flight out the very next day - losing a day on a weekend trip pretty         much kills it. So I extended it to a weeklong vacation. Consequently, don't expect         to see many updates from me for the next week or so. I've been led to understand that         some parts of Europe have Internet access (amazing!), so maybe I can sneak something         in, but don't count on it.      </p>
<p>     My "unplanned emergency vacation" will take me to Copenhagen, Uppsala, Munich, and     Berlin. We'll see how long before I collapse of exhaustion. (I'm looking forward to     Berlin, though. Last time I was there, there was this big concrete wall.)  </body></p>

		<p>Whoo!  Still sounds fun.  Hope you have a great time!  Don&#8217;t enjoy yourself too much while we all slave away at various projects&#8230;  &lt;grin&gt;  Okay, okay, have some extra fun for me or something.  ;)  And just think of all the knitting you can get done on the flight!</p>

		<p>Have a good trip! Guess you won&#8217;t recognise Berlin then, since there&#8217;s been a lot of changes there :-)<br />
Last time I was in Berlin (a few years ago) there was building activity all over the place&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, you&#8217;ve choosen a great time to visit M&#252;nchen, since the October-festival (www.octoberfest.de) is starting next week, which I&#8217;ve heard is a lot of fun :)</p>

		<p>II highly recommend Oktoberfest. I think it was fun&#8230; pretty sure&#8230; it is kind of a blur really&#8230;.</p>

		<p>If you go to Copenhagen, don&#8217;t bother with the statue of the little mermaid.<br />
It was vandalized recently (blown off her stone with explosives) so there isn&#8217;t really anything to look at.  And besides, it wan&#8217;t so great in the first place.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to walk around the old borders of Copenhagen from Tivoli to R&#229;dhuspladsen, Jarmers T&#229;rn, &#216;rstedsparken, Botanisk Have, &#216;stre Anl&#230;g, and all the way up to Kastellet.  All right, go visit Langelinie and the Little Mermaid after Kastellet if you really must, you are right in the neighbourhood anyway.  Parts of the old moat were turned into lakes in Tivoli and the three parks.</p>
<p>Perhaps take a look at Frihedsst&#248;tten, too, on Vesterbrogade outside the central train station&#8230; it was erected shortly after the centennial for the abolishment of &quot;stavnsb&#229;ndet&quot; (1788) that required the peasants to stay in the area they were born unless they got special permission by the local feudal lord.</p>
<p>Or perhaps take a stroll on Assistens Kirkeg&#229;rd, a cemetery that was originally placed far outside of Copenhagen because the existing cemeteries (inside the city walls) were almost filled.  The special thing about it is that it doesn&#8217;t feel at all like a cemetery but rather like a park.  A very nice one, at that.  (&quot;please bear in mind that nude sunbathing is not allowed in the middle area of the grounds, which is still used as a cemetery.&quot; &#8211; from one of the links below)</p>
<p>This is your one chance to go take a look at Hans Christian Andersen&#8217;s, S&#248;ren Kirkegaard&#8217;s, H.C. &#216;rsted&#8217;s, Rasmus Rask&#8217;s, or Niels Bohr&#8217;s graves!</p>
<p>And then there is Rundet&#229;rn, the old observatory/church tower right across Regensen, the university dorms from 1623 (still used).  It has a spiral inside instead of stairs.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the Copenhagen tips, although we didn&#8217;t have time to execute on them. Due to major schedule shuffling, we ended up having only a few hours in Copenhagen, so we visited the central city and looked at the shops, then drove by the canals on the way to the airport. Sorry to give your city so little attention &#8211; I&#8217;ll try to do a better job next time.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
