<p>
The official site says that the bus stops at the corner
of 5th and Dearborn, but that is a
<a HREF="https://binged.it/2sLDjVJ">
nasty five-way intersection</a>,
and you don't want to be standing on the wrong corner
because it'll take you two weeks to cross the street,
and you have to do it while dragging your luggage with you.
</p>
<p>
Okay, TL;DR because you're in a hurry:
The bus stops on 5th Ave next to the Uwajimaya parking lot.
Formally: Northbound after the intersection.
Here's a picture of
<a HREF="https://goo.gl/maps/hvhpHZDgGTt">
a BoltBus at its designated spot</a>.
</p>
<p>
The bus stop used to be further north,
by the International District bus/train station.

Here's a picture of the BoltBus at its former stop</a>.
In fact, there are

at its old stop</a>
than there are of the bus at its new stop.
</p>
<p>
The stop
<a HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/61tlu4/boltbus_permanently_moves_its_seattle_stop_to_5th/">
moved to 5th and Dearborn</a>
last year.
The story I heard was that the old location
conflicted with the Metro bus stop at the same spot.</p>

		<p>When I lived in Redmond I loved taking the carpool only express lane on-ramp to I-90 that&#8217;s at that intersection after Mariner&#8217;s games.  It felt like I was driving on a private freeway like Homer got to use when he joined the Stonecutters secret society.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
