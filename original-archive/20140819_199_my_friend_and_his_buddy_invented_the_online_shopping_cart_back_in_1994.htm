<p>Back in 1994 or so, my friend helped out his buddy who worked as the IT department for a local Seattle company known as <a href="http://www.subpop.com/"> Sub Pop Records</a>. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961228114205/http://www.subpop.com/"> Here's what their Web site looked like back then</a>. Oh, and in case you were wondering, when I said that his buddy worked as the IT department, I mean that the IT department consisted of one guy, namely him. And this wasn't even his real job. His main job was as their payroll guy; he just did their IT because he happened to know a little bit about computers. (If you asked him, he'd say that his main job was as a band member in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(band)">Earth</a>.)</p>
<p> The mission was to make it possible for fans to buy records online. Nobody else was doing this at the time, so they had to invent it all by themselves. The natural metaphor for them was the shopping cart. You wandered through the virtual record store putting records in your basket, and then you went to check out. </p>
<p> The trick here is how to keep track of the user as they wander through your store. This was 1994. Cookies hadn't been invented yet, or at least if they had been invented, support for them was very erratic, and you couldn't assume that every visitor to your site is using a browser that supported them. </p>
<p> The solution was to encode the shopping cart state in the URL by making every link on the page include the session ID in the URL. It was crude but it got the job done. </p>
<p> The site went online, and soon they were taking orders from excited fans around the world. The company loved it, because they probably got to charge full price for the records (rather than losing a cut to the distributor). And my friend told me the deep dark secret of his system: "We do okay if you ask for standard shipping, but the real money is when somebody is impatient and insists on overnight shipping. Overcharging for shipping is where the real money is." </p>
<p> (Note: Statements about business models for a primitive online shopping site from 1994 are not necessarily accurate today.) </p>

		<p>According to Wikipedia¹, the first publicly released version of the SSL spec was SSL 2.0 in February 1995, but that had a number of security flaws; the SSL 3.0 spec was much improved and was released in November 1996. &nbsp;Of course, it probably took a while before browsers starting supporting SSL.</p>

		<p>20 years ago, it was completely different. New albums were still being released in vinyl records, and the most sold medium was the cassette tape. Downloading a short sample from Sub Pop&#39;s web (30 second mono, low quality WAVs weighting at about 800 KB) took about about 10 minutes with the then-typical 14400 bps modems. Downloading a full album in 128 Kbps MP3 would have took 8 to 10 hours &#8211; and then there would be the problem of storing it, with hard drives in the range of 400 MB and no CD writers. Physical records weren&#39;t old technology at all, and selling them in a web store was a great idea.</p>

		<p>@Adam:</p>
<p>That timeline sounds reasonably close from memory &#8212; although I think there was a SSL 1.0 between Netscape servers and Netscape clients before SSL 2.0 was published as a standard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing is &#8212; a lot of times the web forms would collect the data and then&#8230; wait for it&#8230;. wait for it&#8230; send it by email to some mailbox anyway. &nbsp;And so you&#39;d fill in that you were ordering, and some guy would get the message, read it, and manually process the order. &nbsp;</p>
<p>@Antonio:</p>
<p>Don&#39;t give me a wav! &nbsp;That stuffs huge &#8212; S3M, MOD, MID &#8212; I&#39;ll load that on my Gravis Ultrasound and it&#39;ll sound plenty good with a tiny little file. :P</p>

<p>According to the same wikipedia website that people like to cite here (dutch version) MP3 implementations exists since 1994. So while in theory it would have been possible for the site to use MP3 it was surely not so well known &amp; spread as it is now..</p>

		<p>@Dave Bacher: I didn&#39;t include MODs in my dissertation because their working makes it nearly impossible to legally use them for commercial music: they contain the complete music score, all the samples used by it (which the musician wouldn&#39;t be able to license for redistribution from the publishers) and, if the piece isn&#39;t instrumental, recordings for every sung verse.</p>
<p>@Nathan: maybe I should have added a &quot;if they had enough support back then&quot; to the sentence. I knew the specification existed back then (for example, Philip&#39;s DCC, the Digital Compact Cassette, released in 1990, was based on MPEG Layer II, a.k.a. MP2), but I thought it wasn&#39;t necessary to point that.</p>

		<p>Not sure what qualifies as &#39;online shopping cart&#39; in your world, but the internet had this function back in the 80&#39;s [where you could order, change your order, pay].</p>

		<p>@old guy,</p>
<p>In the 80s, the protocols on the internet were lie SMTP for email, FTP for file transfer and Telnet for remote login. The first public presentation of HTML was in 1991 (although work started around 1989 and insiders had probably seen prototypes during 1990).</p>
<p>Obviously, you could send email to, sya, Sears, telling them to put a selection of goods into a basket, but I don&#39;t think that is comparable to the web based shopping carts.</p>

		<p>@Scott^N The bit in the &quot;Real Frank Zappa Book&quot; is actually pretty prescient, considering the man has been dead for twenty years. &nbsp;When people ask me why I still prefer CDs / LPs and DVDs to purely online services, my default answer is &quot;Fetish and Fondlement Value&quot;</p>
<p>Also, Sub-Pop is an amazing label. &nbsp;Much respect for the people who put out SuperFuzzBigMuff.</p>

		<p>@KC,</p>
<p>Unless you insist on the electronic ordering mechanism being digital, you might push it back even further, to the 60s or even 50s. Maybe even before that. In my childhood (that would be the 60s) we could transmit our shopping list through analog electronic devices (called &quot;phones&quot;) to vendors of, say, foodstuff (i.e. the local grocery store) and have the coontents of our shopping cart delivered to our home, by the end of the day (at the latest).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
