<p>Although the inflections and compound-mania are largely absent from the English language, there are still some vestiges of its Germanic roots. One detail of English grammar that I often see neglected is the distinction between the verb+particle and the compound noun.</p>
<p> Consider the verb phrase "to shut down", which is the one I see misused most often. This is a verb+particle combination and is treated as two words. When you turn it into a noun, however, it becomes "shutdown", one word. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?scid=317371"> This Knowledge Base article</a>, for example, manages to keep its head on straight for most of the article, using the verb+particle for the verb form and the compound for the noun form: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  \\computername: Use this switch to specify the remote computer to shut down. </p>
<p> /a: Use this switch to quit a shutdown operation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> But then it slips up towards the end and uses the compound as a verb: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> To schedule the local computer to shutdown and restart at 10:00 P.M. ... </p>
</blockquote>
<p> In other Germanic languages the distinction is clearer. Consider the Swedish and German verbs for "to make up" (as in, "to make up an alibi"): </p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>hitta p&aring;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>p&aring;hittad</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>legen zurecht</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>zurechtlegen</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> In the verb+particle form, the particle comes after the verb, whereas in the single-word form, the particle comes before the verb. It's therefore more obvious when you have one word and when you have two. English does this only rarely, typically for verbs that retain poetic or archaic appeal ("cast down" &rarr; "downcast") and therefore reach back to the language's German roots for their power. </p>
<p> This is one of the reasons why I'm so <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/01/170857.aspx"> fascinated by the Germanic languages</a>: The more I learn about the other languages, the more I learn about my own. </p>

		<p>Other way round, surely? &nbsp;Nerds are the usually considered to be uninterested in social interaction, while most people are geeks about their own subjects. &nbsp;(Then again, there&#8217;s evidence that this is part of an isogloss across the US, so I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s an accepted order.)</p>

		<p>BTW, a lot of the time this distinction between a verbed compound and the original verb + particle is actually used as a distinguishing feature. &nbsp;Consider &quot;run over&quot; and &quot;overrun&quot; (which depend on slightly different functions of over). &nbsp;I have no problem with the verb to setup, because it carries different meaning to set up, and I&#8217;m fairly sure the meanings will diverge further in the future).</p>

		<p>&quot;weeklong&quot; ordeal? Or &quot;week-long&quot; or &quot;week long&quot;?</p>
<p>Anyway, regrettably, this entry has my sister&#8217;s hearty seal of approval. When I asked her whether it should be &quot;shutdown&quot; or &quot;shut down&quot; she made all the same basic points from your post, including the one about germanic&#8230; ack. She interrupts. &quot;&#8217;As&#8217;,&quot; she says. &quot;Or &#8216;as in&#8217; your post.&quot;</p>
<p>This is why so many linguists are found throttled each year.</p>

		<p>Helen: I think A Geek was making a joke, while I was proposing a model for its common usage.</p>
<p>Setup, etc. depends on the understanding of word-boudaries, which has definitely changed across the millennia, and probably varies from person to person. &nbsp;For example, is New Yorker one word or two? &nbsp;If one, why don&#8217;t we write New-Yorker or Newyorker? &nbsp;If two, what does that mean for the word yorker?</p>
<p>Thanks to suffixes and prefixes, compound ambiguity has an effect in most (if not all) Indo-European languages. &nbsp;This is why such a language can&#8217;t be learnt in isolation.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;Mark</p>

		<p>&quot;&quot;weeklong&quot; ordeal? Or &quot;week-long&quot; or &quot;week long&quot;?&quot;</p>
<p>Since &quot;week long&quot; is a compound adjective describing &quot;ordeal&quot;, you&#8217;d hyphenate it as &quot;week-long ordeal&quot;.</p>
<p>When &quot;week long&quot; isn&#8217;t a compound adjective, you don&#8217;t hyphenate it. &nbsp;So you&#8217;d say &quot;that ordeal was a week long&quot;.</p>

		<p>Both of J&#8217;s comments are correct; but in addition, weeklong is a perfectly good word in itself.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/weeklong" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/weeklong</a></p>
<p>It can be used interchangeably with week-long.</p>

		<p>English&#8217;s Germanic roots such as this are another reason why those who prescribe that preposition stranding must be avoided (as in Latin) are simply wrong.</p>

		<p>Oh hell, I didn&#8217;t mean to start this&#8230; but since I did, we are actually in agreement Mr. Steward. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The nerd isn&#8217;t interested in social interaction (as you say) which is why he might spend his time obsessing over the mechanics and origin of his language (as I say) rather than speaking it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The geek on the other hand doesn&#8217;t care so much where or how his language originated, he just doesn&#8217;t want to stumble, mumble, mis-speak, or otherwise err and make a fool of himself when he attempts to socialize with females of the species.</p>

		<p>The &quot;difference between a geek&quot; and a nerd seems to change every time someone defines it. That is to say, there is no common agreement whatsoever among speakers of English on the distinction between the two words, and therefore there IS no distinction in any useful sense. To introduce a novel pair of definitions ex recto and pretend that *this* is what everybody else means when they use the words, is not your best move if you wish to pose as a sentient being, though I&#8217;ll admit there&#8217;s a lot of precedent. If your feelings tell you that the word &quot;cow&quot; indicates a creature with wings, you have not actually discovered anything new about bovine anatomy, nor about language. You have simply failed to note the existence of ego boundaries between yourself and the rest of the human race. </p>
<p>&quot;Setup&quot; is another example of the filthy and repulsive practice of verb/particle merging. A special place in Hell is reserved for people who write that way. </p>

		<p>I found your last comment particularly poignant &#8211; I spent 6 months in Germany after I finished high school, and learning a second language really opened my eyes to my own language. &nbsp;I suddenly found myself thinking about why things were the way they were rather than just using english without thinking about it. &nbsp;Learning German really helped my english abilities, even while making me forget so many words :) They came back quickly when I returned, but the comprehension stayed with me.</p>

		<p>Here be England language without inflect:</p>
<p>Though the inflect and compound mania be large absent from the England language, there be still some vestige of its Germany root. One detail of England grammar that I often see neglect be the distinct between the verb+particle and the compound noun. </p>
<p>Consider the verb phrase &quot;shut down&quot;, which be the one I see misuse more often. This be a verb+particle combine and treat as two word. When you turn it into a noun, however, it become &quot;shutdown&quot;, one word. This Knowledge Base article, for example, manage keep its head on straight for most of the article, use the verb+particle for the verb form and the compound for the noun form: </p>
<p> &nbsp; \computername: Use this switch to specify the remote computer to shut down. </p>
<p> &nbsp; /a: Use this switch to quit a shutdown operation. </p>
<p>But then it slip up towards the end and use the compound as a verb: </p>
<p> &nbsp; To schedule the local computer to shutdown and restart at 10:00 P.M. &#8230; </p>
<p>In other Germany language the distinct be clearer. Consider the Sweden and Germany verb for &quot;make up&quot; (as in, &quot;make up an alibi&quot;): </p>
<p> &nbsp; hitta p&#229; &nbsp; p&#229;hittad<br />
<br /> &nbsp; legen zurecht &nbsp; zurechtlegen </p>
<p>In the verb+particle form, the particle come after the verb, whereas in the single word form, the particle come before the verb. It be therefore more obvious when you have one word and when you have two. England do this one rare, type for verb that retain poet or archive appeal (&quot;cast down&quot; → &quot;downcast&quot;) and therefore reach back to the language&#8217;s Germany root for its power. </p>
<p>This be one of the reason why I be so fascinate by the Germany language: The more I learn about the other language, the more I learn about my own.</p>

		<p>to be honest, even though you say its wrong, you&#8217;re treating the language as a fixed specification. Languages are in a permanent state of flux, the only requirement is that people can understand what you meant when you say (or type) something.</p>
<p>So &quot;shutdown the computer&quot;, and &quot;shut down the computer&quot; are both perfectly acceptable in the modern usage.</p>

		<p>Yes, I started understanding English (my native language) much better once I started learning Spanish in high school. &nbsp;Training in a foreign language was even better than the English classes in making me understand English grammar.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  English&#8217;s Germanic roots such as this are<br />
  <br />&gt; another reason why those who prescribe that<br />
  <br />&gt; preposition stranding must be avoided (as in<br />
  <br />&gt; Latin) are simply wrong.</p>
<p>&gt; E.g., &quot;the computer that I shutdown&quot; vs. &quot;the<br />
  <br />&gt; computer down which I shut&quot; (WTF?)</p>
<p>The &quot;down&quot; in &quot;shut down&quot; is a particle, not a preposition. &nbsp;Thus, it doesn&#8217;t violate a stranded preposition rule.</p>
<p>Just like the &quot;on&quot; in &quot;I was putting you on.&quot; or the &quot;off&quot; in &quot;The report? &nbsp;I was putting that off.&quot;

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
