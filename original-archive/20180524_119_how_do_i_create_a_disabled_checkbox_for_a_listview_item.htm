A customer was using the
<code>LVS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>
extended listview style to get checkboxes for the listview items.
However, they also wanted some items to have a disabled checkbox,
which is not a feature that
<code>LVS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>
supports.
</p>
<p>
They solved the problem by turning off the
<code>LVS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code> extended
style and replicating and extending the functionality of
<code>LVS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code> by
creating a
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20171201-00/?p=97505">
custom state imagelist consisting of enabled and disabled and
checked and unchecked check boxes</a>
and setting that as the state imagelist for the listview.
They also handled the mouse and keyboard notifications so that
clicking on the state image or pressing the space bar toggled
the check/unchecked state of the item.
</p>
<p>
So far so good.
</p>
<p>
However, there is still the issue of accessibility:
Accessibility tools understand that
the
<code>LVS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code> extended
style means that the state images are check boxes,
but since they aren't using that style, that leaves accessibility
tools in the dark.
</p>
<p>
How do they get accessibility tools the information they need?
</p>
<p>
One way is to subclass the listview control and customize the
<code>WM_</code><code>GET&shy;OBJECT</code> message handler
by wrapping the standard accessible object for the listview,
and then override the
<code>get_</code><code>accState</code> method to report the
state for each item.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, they can use
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms697262.aspx">
Dynamic Annotation</a>
to report the state for the item.
Direct Annotation is a push model, where the control pushes the
current state each time it changes.
Server Annotation is a pull model, where the control registers a server
that produces the state of each item upon request.
(Here's
<a HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20090129095433/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/cc307286.aspx">
an example for a custom control</a>.)
</p>
<p>
The customer chose to go with Dynamic Annotation
and reported that it solved their problem.</p>

		<p>I recently learned all about this for the first time. So i was quite tickles when I already understood all the terminology.</p>
<p>A caveat for anyone using direct annotation. It&#8217;s not a piece of accessible metadata that you can set and then not have to worry about. You have to be sure to destroy it when the window is destroyed. This also gets hairy when the visual control framework happens to need to destroy and recreate the window handle out from underneath you. You&#8217;re going you have to be sure to hook every time every underlying window handle is destroyed and recreated: and destroy and recreate your direct annotation.</p>
<p>Which is why in many ways it&#8217;s paradoxically easier to be responsible for every last accessible detail in your application by implementing IAccessible.</p>

		<p>Followed the link for Dynamic Annotation, and had trouble not parsing IAccIdentity as IAccidentIty.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
