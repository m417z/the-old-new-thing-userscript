<p>There were flyers in our building inviting people to attend a food event called <i>A Taste of WWL</i>.</p>
<p> The letters WWL stand for <i>Windows and Windows Live</i>, but the font they chose for the sign was confusing to me. The capital L looked like a capital I, and I misread the poster as an invitation to attend <i>A Taste of WWI</i>. </p>
<p> And then I thought, "Who the heck thought World War&nbsp;I was a fun event we'd want to re-experience?" </p>
<p> One of my colleagues, who also misread the poster, had a much more succinct response: "<a href="http://www.snpp.com/guides/mmmm.html">Mmmm</a>... mustard gas..." </p>

		<p>My father reported that when his company crossed the English Channel in late June 1944, the men consumed hardtack stored since 1918, without complaint and without leftovers. Youth and a couple of years of Army service probably helped render that taste of WWI palatable.</p>

		<p>Yum: I heard a great interview with Ernest Borgnine about his WWII experiences. He was assigned to a PT boat and sent out hunting a submarine that had been spotted in the area. They found the sub, and he dropped depth charge after depth charge at it&#8230; turns out every single depth charge was a dud, and didn&#8217;t go off. Ernest was terrified, thinking he&#8217;d screwed up somehow (forgotten to remove a safety, or set the depth wrong, or launched them wrong.)</p>
<p>The investigation of the event later on revealed that the ship was still stocked with WWI depth charges from 1917 that had never been replaced.</p>
<p>Sorry, this has absolutely nothing to do with the article, I just thought it was a funny anecdote.</p>

		<p>There are reports of British troops eating fifty-year-old biscuits during the American Revolution. &nbsp;They were so hard they had to drop cannonballs to soften them.</p>
<p>Sending a PT boat after a submarine is like sending a motorcycle to attack a tank.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a bakers in the UK called Greggs. They had a slogon of &quot;Pop in a pastie&quot;. Unfortunately the typefont used meant the loop on the second p in pop was the same circle as the o next to it, combined with the fact that the brown lettering overlapped the picture of the pastie itself made it read &quot;Poo in a pastie&quot;. I chuckled like a 4 year old everytime.</p>

		<p>Graham Reeds: The Americans have a different meaning of &quot;pastie&quot; from ours, such that they&#8217;ll probably find your story even more amusing.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
