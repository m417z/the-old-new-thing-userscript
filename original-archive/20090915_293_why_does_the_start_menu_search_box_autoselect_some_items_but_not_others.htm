<p> When you open the Start menu and type into the search box, sometimes the first search result is autoselected (so you just have to hit Enter), whereas sometimes <i>See more results</i> is autoselected. Is there a method to this madness? </p>
<p> If an item is found in the Programs and Control Panel sections, then the first such is autoselected. Otherwise, the default item is <i>See more results</i>. The theory is that if you are typing a program or control panel name from muscle memory and make a typo,  you don't want this to result in a random file opening. (Why are programs and control panels treated differently? Because the list of programs and control panels is relatively static, permitting the development of muscle memory. On the other hand, the other sections like Files and Communications are highly dynamic, and it's unlikely that you're going to get in the habit of always seeing <i>Budget Proposal</i> as the first hit because in an hour's time, it might not be.) </p>

		<p>The problem with start menu search is, it does not seem to remember my choice. Let&#8217;s say I run ABD.lnk 10 times a day, but never run ABC.lnk. Just typing AB never seems to learn what I really mean</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s one feature I absolutly hated in Vista.</p>
<p>If you type quickly, and think you know what you&#8217;ll get, for example &quot;C:[enter]&quot; or &quot;cmd[enter]</p>
<p>What I often actually got was some random other thing beginning with the letter c since the search result list was lagging behind, and the enter key would accept the highlighted default for a search for just &#8216;c&#8217; instead of a search for the entire string I just typed&#8230; often, but not always.</p>
<p>When I was coding test automation for Vista SP1, one issue that drove me crazy was the delayed auto-expansion of the Programs list on the start menu, since the automation tool I was using would move the mouse, pause until it thought the UI element was &#8216;ready&#8217; then click, sometimes the menu would have already expanded, so the click would close it instead of opening it.</p>

<p>Just &quot;Open submenus when I pause over them with the mouse pointer&quot; to &quot;No&quot; in the start bar settings.</p>

		<p>One nice thing Microsoft can do is port the Start menu search keyword improvements in Windows 7 downlevel to poor Vista users who have to type the exact keyword as the name to get search results. A Windows Desktop Update for Windows Vista would be really awesome as the shell differences between Vista and Windows 7 are minor but significant (like Windows 95 -&gt; IE4+Windows 95/Windows 98).</p>

		<p>@MarkKB &#8211; If I type &#8220;regedi&#8221; I don&#8217;t get RegEdit listed. I need to type the final &#8220;t&#8221;. But this is in Windows 7, so it&#8217;s no better there.</p>

		<p>@MarkKB, Bing or Google to learn about the improvements MS did to Start menu keywords in Windows 7 compared to Vista (especially Control Panel), then you&#8217;ll know what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
