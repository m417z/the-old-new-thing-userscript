The 
<a HREF="https://mcec.microsoft.ca/">
Microsoft Canada Excellence Centre</a>
in Vancouver&sup1;
<a HREF="http://www.bctechnology.com/news/2016/6/20/Microsoft-Opens-State-of-the-Art-Technology-Centre-in-Vancouver.cfm">
opened less than two months ago</a>.
It still has the
<a HREF="http://gizmodo.com/5896801/what-exactly-is-that-new-car-smell">
new-building smell</a>.
And I'll be speaking there tomorrow at 11am.
This will be a more relaxed version of the five-minute
talk on blogging I gave at TechReady&sup2; a few weeks ago.
So instead of five minutes of intense panic,
it'll be an hour of relaxed panic.
</p>
<p>
The talk is only for Microsoft employees, so basically
this message is useful only to the few hundred Microsoft employees
who work in the Vancouver area.
But this is another case of
"How do you get Raymond to speak at your conference?
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20091007-01/?p=16453/">
You invite him</a>."
We have a family event in Vancouver this weekend, and the
MCEC folks took advantage of my presence in their fair city
to book a talk while I happened to be in town.
Saves them the travel expenses.
</p>
<p>
For the Q&amp;A, I'm asking people to bring a question
that I can answer in one minute, so I can reuse it on
<a HREF="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/One-Dev-Minute">
One Dev Minute</a>.
If you want to pretend you're attending my talk,
you can
ask an answerable-in-one-minute question in the comments below.
After all, if I don't have any questions to answer,
then there won't be any more videos.
</p>
<p>
&sup1; Vancouver, British Columbia, to be precise.
Normally, one needs to be careful, because there is also
Vancouver, Washington, which is about
<a HREF="https://binged.it/2aCxOkW">
five an a half hours' drive (and a border crossing) away</a>
from Vancouver, British Columbia.
On the other hand, the fact that it's the Microsoft <i>Canada</i>
Excellence Centre should be a tip-off that it's in, y'know, Canada.
</p>
<p>
&sup2; TechReady is a Microsoft internal conference
that takes place in Seattle around twice a year.
My colleague
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/cjacks/">
Chris Jackson</a>
occasionally asks me to give a presentation there,
and occasionally I agree.</p>

		<p>One Minute Question &#8211; Why is it when you select multiple files in explorer (using shift or control), such as from OpenFileDialog, or for playing mp3s, it will place the last file selected first, and then place the remaining files in their original selected order? Why isn&#8217;t my first file choice in first place?</p>

		<p>Because the &#8220;last&#8221; file in the list (the final file you click on) has the focus &#8212; you may notice the dotted-outline focus rectangle, depending on the Windows version and theme.</p>
<p>The focussed file always seems to get &#8220;first position&#8221; in the list, then the remainder of the list is in normal sort order.</p>
<p>I have a habit of selecting blocks of files from end-to-start for just this reason.  Doing it backwards means the first file gets the focus and the launched program gets everything in the order I intend.</p>

		<p>The user selection doesn&#8217;t matter. Instead it should follow the order established by the user from Windows Explorer.<br />
The principle should be the same as for selection and copy and paste. If you select a sentence of English text in the opposite order as you read it and then paste it, you will see the original sentence as you expect it. I assume it works for right-to-left writing scripts as well (but in the opposite direction for western writing script).</p>

		<p>Enjoy your visit to Vancouver. I&#8217;m disappointed that your talk isn&#8217;t open to outsiders like me. I guess I&#8217;ll have to wave in your general direction tomorrow. Happy border crossing!</p>

		<p>Once in a while, scrolling over to the west coast, I have been momentarily confused seeing Vancouver, WA, only to realize I&#8217;m a bit too far south on the map for Vancouver, BC as the map loads. They shouldn&#8217;t be so close! :P</p>

		<p>Now you are making me think of having tea at the Butchart Gardens.<br />
(on Vancouver Island)<br />
*at least George Washington made it to the West Coast to name a state after himself, to keep it distinct fro his city*<br />
Good luck with your talk &#8211; can I invite you to Southern California? (Or rather, would I get an affirmative response if I did?)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m really bad at one minute questions &#8211; or questions in general. But I recently looked closer at the &#8220;Marlett&#8221; font in comparison to the classic Windows theme (the one since 95, without all the visual style stuffs). It looks like there are characters in Marlett which map to the 3D border parts of caption buttons, each for one darker / lighter color of the 3D effect. Is it true the classic captions buttons were composed just out of drawing characters taken from &#8220;Marlett&#8221; rather than drawing a custom 3D rectangle?</p>

		<p>When I was in Portland earlier this summer, a local there told me about a family he met once.  That family had googled for &#8220;closest airport to Vancouver&#8221;, and ended up flying into Portland, which is in fact the closest airport to Vancouver, WA.  They were dismayed to learn they had a 5.5-hour drive to where they actually wanted to go to.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth doing more than 3 seconds worth of research into which airport you want to fly into when you&#8217;re travelling somewhere.</p>

		<p>A few years ago, I reserved flights for my family to southern California and to save money we flew into Ontario International Airport.  I verified multiple times that the Ontario, CA address was CA=California and not CA=Canada.  Much longer than a 5 hr drive.</p>

		<p>It was great to have you in Vancouver Raymond. I didn&#8217;t believe it first you were coming in person. It was a mesmerizing experience to meet in person the guy whose posts you have read over the years. Just so you know, i have been reading your posts off and on since college and i have been in industry for over 10 years and now almost a year at Microsoft Vancouver.</p>

		<p>¹ The spelling &#8220;centre&#8221; is an addtional hint about which Vancouver you mean. :)  Also, based on the few Washington residents that I know, saying &#8220;Vancouver&#8221; means Vancouver, WA by default.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
