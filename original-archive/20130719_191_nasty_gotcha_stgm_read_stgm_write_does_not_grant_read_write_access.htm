<p>You might think that if you want to get read/write access, you could pass <code>STGM_<wbr>READ | STGM_<wbr>WRITE</wbr></wbr></code>. You would be wrong. You have to pass <code>STGM_<wbr>READ&shy;WRITE</wbr></code>.</p>
<p> The three flags <code>STGM_<wbr>READ</wbr></code>, <code>STGM_<wbr>WRITE</wbr></code>, and <code>STGM_<wbr>READ&shy;WRITE</wbr></code> are mutually exclusive. If you try to combine them, you get a weird mess. </p>
<p> In particular, since the numerical value of <code>STGM_<wbr>READ</wbr></code> is zero, passing <code>STGM_<wbr>READ | STGM_<wbr>WRITE</wbr></wbr></code> is numerically equivalent to passing <code>STGM_<wbr>WRITE</wbr></code>, which grants write-only access. </p>
<p> The documentation for the <code>STGM_*</code> constants specifically says "<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380337(v=vs.85).aspx">It is not valid to use more than one element from a single group</a>," and <code>STGM_<wbr>READ</wbr></code> and <code>STGM_<wbr>WRITE</wbr></code> belong to the Access group (as does <code>STGM_<wbr>READ&shy;WRITE</wbr></code>). </p>
<p> These values date back to the days of MS-DOS, where function 3Dh (Open File) passed an access mode in the AL register. </p>

<p> The bottom three bits specified the requested access (0 = read-only, 1 = write-only, 2 = read/write), and the remaining bits were reserved. </p>
<p> Later, when networking support was added in approximately MS-DOS 3.5, three more bits were pressed into service: </p>

<p> Sharing modes were 0 = compatibility mode, 1 = deny all, 2 = deny write, 3 = deny read, 4 = deny none. </p>

		<p>This isn&#39;t the only function like this &#8211; open() is the same way, both on MSVC and on many Unix systems (including the original). I wonder if that&#39;s where DOS got it from.</p>
<p>I&#39;m somewhat confused that you say the bottom three bits are used, when the values only occupy two bits.</p>

		<p>And here begins the problem of so many programs opening files with delete locks when they don&#39;t need it or have any reason to care.</p>
<p>@Random832: And on UNIX mode 3 means open handle to symbolic link (only on some kernels). The handle has a few uses, but read and write aren&#39;t among them.</p>

		<p>If only they had thought to make the names &quot;STGM_READ_ONLY&quot; and &quot;STGM_WRITE_ONLY&quot;, then there might not be a problem. Few people would attempt to combine read-only with write-only.</p>

		<p>Every time I see those STGM_* constants I pronounce them &quot;stigmata&quot;. Which is actually pretty appropriate considering the pain they have put me through in the past.</p>

		<p>@Random832 It goes back long before UNIX; AFAICT, tape-only OSes used a single bit for &quot;read or write?&quot;; when disks came along, to keep compatibility, they expanded to a 2 bit field, and made the third option &quot;both read and write&quot;. That historical accident appears to have been pulled forward ever since.</p>

		<p>@Simon: Interesting piece of knowledge. There&#39;s nothing stopping you from having both 0x0 and 0x2 mean &quot;read&quot; though (assuming 0x1 used to mean write), so I don&#39;t know what they were thinking.</p>

		<p>This &quot;problem&quot; is caused by the values of constants being so easily buried in include files or the other similar methods (such as type libraries.) The values themselves indicate that they are not rooted in bit positions.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
