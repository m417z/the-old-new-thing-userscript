<p>So it happens that Opening Day of the baseball season  coincides with Good Friday,  a day of "fasting and abstinence" according to Catholic tradition.  (Then again, after Vatican II, the definition of "fasting and  abstinence" weakened significantly. All that most people remember  any more is "no meat".)</p>
<p>  Catholics in Boston have applied to the archdiocese for a  special dispensation so they can have a hot dog at the game.  The Church said  "<a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/articles/2004/03/12/church_nixes_good_friday_fenway_hot_dogs/">Nice try</a>".  </p>

		<p>I can think back to a couple of occasions we were allowed to eat meat on Friday by the diocese in grade school.  I forget what the occasion actually was though.  This is going to drive me crazy&#8230;</p>

		<p>What&#8217;s the big deal? It&#8217;s not like hot dogs are made of meat. I&#8217;m not sure what exactly they&#8217;re made of, but it ain&#8217;t meat.</p>

		<p>I guess they don&#8217;t value their values very much. :P</p>
<p>Why not ask the basball park to provide veggie dogs on that day</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I was an observant Catholic, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that grade-school kids are technically exempt.</p>

		<p>Some ballparks do have veggie dogs, and almost all are going to have some kind of non-meat alternative available. That&#8217;s not the point. The point is that it&#8217;s opening day of the season, and they want a real hotdog damnit.</p>
<p>Guess it all just comes down to which religion people believe in more strongly, Catholicism or Baseball&#8230;</p>

		<p>This is what happens when mysticism-derived stricture meets living a life as a thinking, rational human being that desires to actually live in the here and now, rather than living for some heretofore unseen, unverified fantasy prize.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d think that being a Red Sox fan alone was enough punishment. Eat the hot dog and enjoy the optimism that every team and fan has at the beginning of the season. ;)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t quite understand what the fuss is about anyway.  Why on earth would they consider not selling hotdogs just because it&#8217;s Good Friday?  Unless everyone who goes is a devout Catholic, it seems like a load of nosense&#8230;</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t see what the deal is either. For religious people, it&#8217;s only a minor sin anyway, so what? Go to the church the day after and confess it to your favorite priest.</p>

		<p>I dont really see the big deal.  If you cant go one day without a hot dog then you really should look at your life.  Also catholics always do things wrong then just go and confess and that makes it all better. Have your hotdog and confess it the next day.  Whats the worst that will happen?  A few hail marys and your right again.</p>

		<p>Doing something you know is bad with the intention of confessing it sort of misses the point of the exercise.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
