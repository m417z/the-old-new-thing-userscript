Some time ago,
we discussed
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20121212-00/?p=5853/">
how you're supposed to free the information returned by the
<code>Get&shy;Security&shy;Info</code> function</a>.
But what about the information passed to the
<code>Set&shy;Security&shy;Info</code> function?
"How do I free that?"
</p>
<p>
You free that memory by whatever means you like.
You allocated the memory originally,
so you get to free it.
If you allocated the memory with <code>malloc</code>,
then use <code>free</code>.
If you allocated the memory with <code>new</code>,
then use <code>delete</code>.
Whatever mechanism you used to allocate the memory,
use the corresponding mechanism for freeing it.
</p>
<p>
"Do I have to free the old DACL being replaced?"
</p>
<p>
No, that is managed by the system.
What you're doing is saying,
"Dear operating system:
Here is a kernel object and some security information.
Please set the security on the kernel object to match
the information I'm giving you.
Thanks."
</p>
<p>
"So you're saying that if I have code that does this:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Get&shy;Security&shy;Info(&hellip;, &amp;oldAcl, &hellip;)</code></li>
<li>Create <code>newAcl</code> by copying the <code>oldAcl</code> and making appropriate changes.</li>
<li><code>Set&shy;Security&shy;Info(&hellip;, newAcl, &hellip;)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
then I need to free the <code>newAcl</code> but not the <code>oldAcl</code>?"
</p>
<p>
No, that's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying that the call to <code>Set&shy;Security&shy;Info</code>
does not create any new obligations to free memory.
However, it also does not destroy any existing obligations to free memory.
</p>
<p>
Calling
<code>Get&shy;Security&shy;Info</code> created an obligation
to free <code>oldAcl</code>.
That obligation was not changed by the call to
<code>Set&shy;Security&shy;Info</code>.
</p>
<p>
What I mean by saying that you don't have to free
the old DACL being replaced is that when you call
<code>Set&shy;Security&shy;Info</code>,
the system frees its internal security info
and replaces it with a copy of the
security info you passed in.
You don't need to worry about freeing that internal info.
(Not that you could, because you don't know how it was
allocated.)
But of course, if you made a copy of the internal
security info, then you are on the hook for freeing
the copy.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at it this way:
</p>
<ul>
<li>There is some secret security info out there managed by space aliens from the planet Krypton.
    You do not have direct access to it.
    The only way to access it is by calling functions like
    <code>Get&shy;Security&shy;Info</code>
    and
    <code>Set&shy;Security&shy;Info</code>.
</li>
<li>
    The
    <code>Get&shy;Security&shy;Info</code> function says,
    "Dear space aliens: Please take your security info, translate them from Kryptonese to Win32,
    and give me the translation. I will free the translation when I'm done."
</li>
<li>
    The
    <code>Set&shy;Security&shy;Info</code> function says,
    "Dear space aliens: Here is some security info in Win32 format.
    Please translate it to Kryptonese and use that as the new security info."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You don't speak Kryptonese, but that's okay,
because your only interaction with the security info is through
Win32 format.
If you ask for a copy of the internal security info,
then you are responsible for freeing that copy.
But the internal Kryptonese security info
is not something you need to worry about.
The space aliens will take care of that.</p>

		<p>This should not be a surprise to most people, what does surprise me however is this little warning on the bottom of the MSDN documentation: &#8220;If the supplied handle was opened with an ACCESS_MASK value of MAXIMUM_ALLOWED, then the SetSecurityInfo function will not propagate ACEs to children.&#8221; </p>
<p>If you are able to get the required access rights, why does it matter how you ask for those rights?</p>

		<p>It seems to be an example of something being named for what it is, rather than what it&#8217;s for. Its use triggers various special cases across the ACL function family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of special note is the MAXIMUM_ALLOWED bit, which is generally used with the AccessCheck(â€¦) function to determine whether a security descriptor grants a specified set of access rights to the client identified by an access token. Typically, server applications use this function to check access to a private object.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think the MAXIMUM_ALLOWED bit is set in the handle? It probably maps to the access you get when you create the handle.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
