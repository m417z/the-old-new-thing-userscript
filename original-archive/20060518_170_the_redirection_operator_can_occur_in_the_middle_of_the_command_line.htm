Although the redirection operator traditionally appears at the end
of a command line, there is no requirement that it do so.
All of these commands are equivalent:
</p>
<pre>
echo A B&gt;C
echo A&gt;C B
echo&gt;C A B
&gt;C echo A B
</pre>
<p>
All of them echo "A B" to the file "C".
</p>
<p>
You can use this trick to avoid
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/05/17/599916.aspx">
the redirection problem we discussed last time</a>.
We saw that writing
</p>
<pre>
set message=Meet at 2
echo %message%&gt;schedule
</pre>
<p>
inadvertently interprets the "2" as part of the redirection operator.
One solution was to insert a space:
</p>
<pre>
echo %message% &gt;schedule
</pre>
<p>
but this assumes that the space won't cause a problem.
If you're in a case where that space will indeed cause a problem,
you can use the trick above to move the redirection operator
to a location where it won't cause any trouble:
</p>
<pre>
&gt;schedule echo %message%
</pre>

		<p>IIRC, it worked that way back in the command.com from DOS 5 or so. &nbsp;Not sure about earlier.</p>
<p>(Of course in anything pre-cmd.exe, you can&#8217;t redirect stderr anyway, but putting a redirection at the beginning of the command did work. &nbsp;Actually in NT 4, you may not be able to redirect stderr either, but I&#8217;m not sure on that one.)</p>

		<p>The way it works is that the token immediately following a &lt; or &gt; is a filename for redirection, while everything else is part of the command to be executed. The parser has no reason to care where in the command the redirection token occurs. </p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that it just always worked this way, ever since redirection was first implemented. In fact, I suspect that this goes all the way to when the syntax was first created in Unix, around 1972. </p>
<p>Don&#39;t forget that Microsoft did the port of Unix to microcomputers shortly before DOS was released, so there would have been plenty of people around with Unix experience.</p>

		<p>However these command produce different results:</p>

		<p>Well, um, yes, because in the first the redirection to dirsort.txt is part of the &quot;dir&quot; command. &nbsp;In the second, it&#8217;s part of the &quot;sort&quot; command.</p>
<p>So in the first, you&#8217;ve told the shell that stdout for the dir command should go to two different places (the file dirsort.txt and a pipe to another process). &nbsp;If you don&#8217;t get an error, the shell probably does either the first or last, but it won&#8217;t do both.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
