<p>Time for the semi-annual link clearance.</p>
<ul>
<li>     <a href="http://www.ft.com/comment/columnists/lucykellaway">     Lucy Kellaway</a>     campaigns against management jargon.     Last November, she     <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3cb5f0fa-8965-11dc-b52e-0000779fd2ac.html">     railed against</a>     a phrase     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/09/25/5108967.aspx">     I too had ridiculed</a>:     <i>going forward</i>. </li>
<li>     <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/11/going-forward.html">     Scott Adams blogs about going forward</a>.     I found it fascinating that of the four ways he thought blogging would     be rewarding, only the last one held true.     And I can definitely feel for the predicament     that every blog post reduced his income. </li>
<li>     So you're ordering something from     <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">     Amazon</a>     and you're just a smidge short of the $25 necessary to get     free shipping.     You could either fork over the $8 for shipping or use the     <a href="http://www.filleritem.com/">     Amazon Filler Item Finder</a>     to find something (like say a pack of batteries for 87 cents)     that will get you free shipping. </li>
<li>     So you're bidding on an item on     <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">     eBay</a>     and the seller has a 99.5% feedback rating (which by some     people's reckoning is "barely acceptable"),     and you want to see what those five negative comments were,     because if they were just weenie complaints,     then you'll bid on the item.     Since it's hard to find those negative feedback items via eBay's     interface, you can turn to the     <a href="http://toolhaus.org/cgi-bin/negs">     eBay negative/neutral feedback finder</a>. </li>

		<p>Ah yes, the Packard Hells. Here in Israel they were well-marketed, and somewhat prettier that the beige boxes you could otherwise find, so many bought them. Working as a PC technician at these times (1997-8), I remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>One with a combination modem/sound card (Aztek?), neither of which worked in Win95.</li>
<li>
<p>One in a desktop form with a 14&quot; CRT molded on top of it, cables still routed from outside. It was really hard to open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One in an inverted-T form, where the motherboard would lie across the bottom, and the drives on the tower part. I think the cards hung parallel to the motherboard, from a riser board.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But, my prize goes to a Pentium-100 IBM which I simply could not open. That was one disappointed customer.</p>

		<p>&quot;- One in a desktop form with a 14&quot; CRT molded on top of it, cables still routed from outside. It was really hard to open.&quot;</p>
<p>There are better ways of doing all-in-one PCs than this hack! Apple did it the right way.</p>
<p>BTW, the MacBook Air is very close to a disposable, non-expandable computer, it is just too expensive to be one.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the great reading Raymond. &nbsp;You are definitely one of my personal hero&#8217;s. &nbsp;&lt;g&gt;</p>

		<p>What about 16-bit fonts? Loading them would have the same problems as loading 16-bit icons.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
