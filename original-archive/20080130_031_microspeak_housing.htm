		<p>That is a common term for what-it-describes. Many people outside MSFT use that.</p>
<p>So as long as they don&#8217;t tell you that your car should be spaced at a temporary place, it&#8217;s sort of prior art.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m a grad student, and tend to use the verb &quot;live&quot; to refer to my relation to the office. It&#8217;s a joke, but it&#8217;s a sad, sad joke.</p>

		<p>At my company, facilities uses the verb &quot;to sit&quot; in odd ways. As in &quot;Employees who sit in San Francisco will have free lunch today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where do you sit?&quot; could mean &quot;Which city do you work in?&quot; or &quot;Which building in that city?&quot; or &quot;Which office in that building?&quot;</p>

		<p>Pretty standard here too, it doesn&#8217;t even need to refer to people: &quot;This building houses 10 of our new death ray generators&quot;.</p>

		<p>Kemp: I think it comes from that usage, which is the problem. &nbsp;Housing applies to objects, not people. &nbsp;It sounds nicer than &quot;containing&quot; and avoids the awkward &quot;workers who work in Building X&quot;.</p>
<p>Scott: X *is* a number!</p>
<p>There should be a Building X&#8230;</p>

		<p>My wife is a hairdresser, and she&#8217;s introduced me to an interesting bit of terminology: she has a &#8216;section&#8217; in the shop, which has the usual mirrors, chair, and so on. &nbsp;Hairdressers refer to the chair as where they &#8216;sit&#8217;, even though they never sit in the chair. &nbsp;So, for instance, my wife &#8216;sits&#8217; in the first chair on the right as you go in, but she&#8217;s never actually sat in the chair!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
