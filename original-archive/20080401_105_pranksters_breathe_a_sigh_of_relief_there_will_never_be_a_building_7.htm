<p>It is a longstanding prank at Microsoft's main Redmond campus to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2003/03/15/3872.aspx"> send an unsuspecting new employee to building&nbsp;7</a> under the pretense of having a meeting or needing to pick up something. There is no such building on the main Microsoft campus. This nonexistent building has also been used as a sort of inside joke. For example, if somebody invites you to <a href="http://www.randyrants.com/2006/02/you_have_a_meet.html"> a meeting in Building&nbsp;7</a>, they're probably inviting you off campus to take a break from work.</p>
<p> A few years ago, there was a vacancy in a small business park a very short walk from the main Microsoft campus. (You don't even have to cross the street to get there.) I thought it would be great if somebody leased the space and opened a bar called <i>Building&nbsp;7</i>. It could have a back room decorated like a Microsoft meeting room, complete with WiFi and a large monitor. Then somebody could legitimately invite you to a meeting in Building&nbsp;7, and people could use it as a cover story: "Sorry, I'm going to be working late tonight. Team meeting in Building&nbsp;7." </p>
<p> The announcement in February 2006 of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2006/feb06/02-09CampusExpand.mspx"> a major expansion of the main Redmond campus</a> came with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/images/press/2006/02-09campus-map_med.jpg"> a little map</a>, and people with way too much time on their hands pored over the unreadably tiny print on the map and noticed a little <i>7</i> printed on the orange building in the upper right corner. They quietly fretted that a piece of Microsoft history was vanishing and that they'll have to come up with a new prank to play on the new-hires. </p>
<p> In June 2007, pranksters (and people with a nostalgic streak) breathed a sigh of relief. The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/30/7315956.aspx"> real estate department</a> announced that the new building tentatively labelled <i>7</i> on the map will now be known as Building&nbsp;37. In deference to Microsoft tradition, the name <i>Building&nbsp;7</i> has been officially retired. There will never be a Building&nbsp;7. </p>

		<p>After Microsoft and Yahoo couldn&#8217;t agree in negotiations and Yahoo really didn&#8217;t want to sell, they offered to /buy Microsoft/ instead today. Part of the deal will be new branding: Live is to be renamed &quot;Livr&quot; and &quot;.Net&quot; will be &quot;.Noo!&quot;. The new slogan will be &quot;Where do you Yahoo! today?&quot;.</p>

		<p>The Apple R&amp;D campus had a similar thing, with six buildings referred to as &quot;R&amp;D 1&quot; through &quot;R&amp;D 6&quot;, with the lounge/bar/restaurant Peppermill on the same block being known as &quot;R&amp;D 7&quot;. Peppermill has been replaced with something else now, not sure if it&#8217;s still &quot;R&amp;D 7&quot;.</p>

		<p>I can vouch for the accuracy of the Apple/Peppermill comment, but not Raymond&#8217;s post. :)</p>
<p>When the Peppermill died, the R&amp;D 7 tag simply went away. Whatever replaced it was so non-descript that I don&#8217;t recall what it was (some kind of buffet for old people?), and it&#8217;s probably been replaced by something else now.</p>

		<p>Also today, a posting on Raymond Chenâs blog discussed another awfully peculiar connection: âA few years ago, there was a vacancy in a small business park a very short walk from the main Microsoft campus&#8230;â. Raymond goes on to discuss âBuilding 7â, which he describes as âThis nonexistent building&#8230;â Now, I do trust Raymond, and heâs been with Microsoft since, well I donât know when. But&#8230; come on, really? Steve is going to work for Google, from a building thatâs basically onsite the Microsoft campus? &nbsp;It may sound outlandish, but&#8230; Pingback: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://dataland.wordpress.com/2008/04/01/steve-ballmer-defects-to-google/" rel="nofollow">http://dataland.wordpress.com/2008/04/01/steve-ballmer-defects-to-google/</a></p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
