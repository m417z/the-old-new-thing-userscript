<p>Earlier versions of Internet Explorer used inline autocomplete, but newer versions use drop-down autocomplete that requires you to press the down-arrow key to select an item from the drop-down. Why the change?</p>
<p> Because it interferes with normal keyboard operation. </p>
<p> Suppose <code>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/</code> is in your history, but you want to go to <code>http://www.microsoft.com/</code>. As you type the desired destination, inline autocomplete kicks in and fills in the remainder of the URL for you, <code>http://www.microsoft.com/<span color="blue" style="color:highlighttext; background: highlight">windows/</span></code>. If you aren't watching the screen and just hit Enter, you end up going to the autocompleted URL instead of the URL you typed. Oops. </p>
<p> To me, this is a fatal flaw, namely that one has to be watching the screen to perform an operation that one would think consisted purely of typing. In particular, this creates problems for people with limited visual capability who necessarily "type blind" most of the time. </p>
<p> Even using Tab as the autocomplete character suffers from the same flaw. Consider the Run dialog or IE's address bar. In those places, the Tab key moves you around the window. (To the OK, Cancel, and Browse buttons on the Run dialog, or into the web page itself for IE.) If the Tab key were the autocomplete completion key, it wouldn't be possible to Tab around the dialog/window any more. For example, suppose you want to browse around your C drive, so you type <code>C:\</code> into the Run dialog and hit Tab three times to get to the Browse button. But, oops, the Tab key autocompletes, so instead of browsing <code>C:\</code>, you're browsing whatever directory in your C: drive the autocomplete engine decided to show you. </p>

		<p>Okay, having a real pain in the butt getting this posted for some reason.</p>
<p>I was basically going to say that inline AutoComplete doesn&#8217;t work exactly as Raymond stated.  It will only fill in each important substring, not the entire URL unless the entire URL is just a single domain.  In general:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.domain.com/subfolder1/subfolder2/.../subfolderN/somepage.html" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://www.domain.com/subfolder1/subfolder2/" rel="nofollow">http://www.domain.com/subfolder1/subfolder2/</a>&#8230;/subfolderN/somepage.html</p>
<p>If you start typing <a href="http://www.domain.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.domain.com</a>, IE will only inline complete the domain part of the URL.  If you start typing subfolder1 it will only complete subfolder1, and so on until you get to the final slash in the URL in which case it will start trying to auto-complete the final page in the URL.</p>

		<p>This is IMO one of the lamest &#8216;improvements in VS 2003 : same inline autocomplete in File/Open dialog. How the hell do you easily open a .h file ? autocomplete always wants to open the .cpp :-(</p>
<p>I hope this is &#8216;fixed&#8217; in VS 2005</p>

		<p>I just don&#8217;t understand why isn&#8217;t inline autocomplete only doing what you want, which is the main domain &quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.microsoft.com&quot;?" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://www.microsoft.com&#038;quot" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com&#038;quot</a>;?<br />
<br />Isn&#8217;t that possible? I mean, that&#8217;s what most people would want anyway.<br />
<br />And if they really want a section of the site, then inline autocomplete would include &quot;/windows&quot; if the user types the &quot;/&quot; after the domain name.<br />
<br />Why is this so hard to do?</p>

		<p>Vitor and Uhrak:  Read my comment above, that IS how IE works with inline auto-complete.  Except that a user typing in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/</a> will still just auto-complete to the domain name.  Auto-completion after the domain will not occur until they start typing something after the slash.</p>

		<p>I have a slightly different beef with IE6 autocomplete.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say I want to go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com</a>.  I start typing in the address, but I make a typo:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.n" rel="nofollow">http://www.n</a></p>
<p>At this point, IE autocompletes the URL to, say, <a href="http://www.newegg.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com</a>.  But I&#8217;m typing blind, and can feel that I hit the wrong key.  I hit backspace to delete the &quot;n&quot; and hit &quot;m&quot;, like I meant to.  But the backspace actually just deletes the part that autocompletion filled in (&quot;ewegg.com&quot;), so I now have:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nmicrosoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nmicrosoft.com</a></p>
<p>Twenty years of experience hitting backspace when I make a typo, and it no longer works.  Worse yet, there&#8217;s a race condition:  Sometimes I realize my mistake before autocomplete does its thing, and sometimes I don&#8217;t.  The effect of hitting backspace depends on which happens first.</p>

		<p>mph: Actually, for me (when using IE6), backspace deletes the character I typed last and not the autocompleted text, which is not actually included in the text field until I hit the down arrow key to accept autocomplete suggestion.</p>
<p>The shell Run dialog works the same way for me, too.</p>

		<p>Raymond is spot on &#8211; inline autocomplete is lousy. Now someone send this blog post to the Office team &#8212; Office&#8217;s Open/Save As dialogs STILL use inline autocomplete and I get a twinge of irritation every time I have to use its dialogs.</p>

		<p>VS 2005 (and possibly earlier versions too) has another &quot;feature&quot; like this &#8211; Intellisense uses the first option in its list even if you don&#8217;t select it and hit tab. Forget about getting a tab inserted. I filed a bug report but it was closed as &quot;by design&quot;. Oh well.</p>

		<p>mph:</p>
<p>Windows XP by default appears to disable inline autocomplete (so only the drop-down menu appears), whereas I remember 2000 having it enabled by default.</p>
<p>Try changing it in IE&#8217;s Advanced Settings &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty sure the change applies to the Run dialog box too.</p>
<p>I too get annoyed by Office&#8217;s messy Open box (looks ugly, doesn&#8217;t copy the rest of the system, ect ect).  It should do its own stuff only on old platforms (e.g. Win9x).</p>

		<p>More annoying is typing a UNC path in Windows Explorer&#8217;s address bar, just to have it &#8216;select all&#8217; whilst typing, with the net result of removing the first half of the hostname and or sharename.<br />

		<p>Would [CTRL]+[TAB] work for autocomplete in dialog boxes?  IMO, it&#8217;s easier to hit those two keys rather than the down arrow (which, on a standard 101 key keyboard requires moving your hands from the alphabet keys to another part of the KB altogether.)</p>
<p>I just tried [CTRL]+[TAB] and it worked the same way as just [TAB].</p>
<p>To the Windows teams&#8217; credit, Windows has always been excellent about providing an easy way to navigate around with either keyboard or mouse.  Since I don&#8217;t have space for a mouse on every machine I&#8217;m working on, I usually just plug in a keyboard and go.</p>

		<p>Ctrl+Tab is the &quot;change tabs on a property sheet&quot; hotkey. Using it for autocomplete means that an autocomplete inside a property sheet would have a hotkey conflict.</p>

		<p>Personally I make sure to always enable inline autocomplete because I like the fact that it saves me time and generally gets it right.</p>
<p>Yes, I have to look at the screen when I type. No, I don&#8217;t find this a problem.</p>
<p>However, the IE implementation is much better than the firefox one &#8211; the IE one just fills in the relevant substrings as mentioned above, whereas the firefox one just fills in the last complete URL you typed and doesn&#8217;t do any splitting on slashes, as well as having a few other flaws.</p>
<p>In general I find the IE and MS implementations to be very useful and always inline autocomplete.</p>

		<p>The new autocomplete has problems too.  I&#8217;m glad that the old autocomplete defaults to off now, for the same reason you stated.  But in the new autocomplete, when IE automatically opens a dropdown box and highlights one of the entries, the highlight is false.  A frequent example:  I type <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://k and" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://k" rel="nofollow">http://k</a> and as soon as I hit the k, IE displays a dropdown box with the entry for <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://kakaku.com/news" rel="nofollow">http://kakaku.com/news</a> highlighted.  I hit the Enter key, IE tries to open <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://k which" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://k" rel="nofollow">http://k</a> which doesn&#8217;t exist, and then either gives a DNS error or sometimes I stop it first.  If I backspace out of the k, press the k again, and use arrow keys to move downwards and then back upwards in the dropdown list, then the highlighted entry is really selected.</p>

		<p>The behaviour in Safari, i.e. the old IE behaviour, also drives me mad.  I am fighting the autocomplete *every day* as described in the log entry, for example to go to the main page of my blog vs the /wp-admin sub-page (which I had to type in originally ).  </p>

		<p>&quot;Even using Tab as the autocomplete character suffers from the same flaw.&quot;</p>
<p>So why hasn&#8217;t this one been disabled yet? I&#8217;ve had to learn the Alt+F shortcut for Open as Web Folder because I find Esc, Tab confusing &#8211; I expect Esc to undo the autocomplete and Enter to finish the autocomplete without submitting the dialog.</p>

		<p>Inline autocomplete annoys the crap out of me.  Excel 2003 still does it too, according to previously entered fields elsewhere in the worksheet.  This is annoying; let&#8217;s say I have a previously filled out cell called &quot;Foo Bar&quot; and now I want to enter &quot;Foo&quot; in a cell.  If I just type &quot;Foo&quot;, and press enter, then &quot;Foo Bar&quot; gets entered.  Great.  The best method I have for avoiding this is to type &quot;Foo&quot;, hit the spacebar, then hit backspace, and this will disable autocomplete long enough for me to move on.</p>

		<p>Want to go to microsoft.com in IE?  Just go to the address bar and type &quot;microsoft&quot; then hit Ctrl+Enter.  IE auto-adds the &quot;www.&quot; and &quot;.com&quot; parts of the URL and loads it.</p>
<p>The words offender of auto-complete IMO isn&#8217;t IE, but the Run dialog.  So it pops up a list of most-recently used items, but to select them you have to use your mouse or move your fingers over to the arrow keys.  It makes the list useless; it&#8217;s faster for me to just type the entire path.  Raymond&#8217;s argument against using Tab is easily countered by using Esc to dismiss the list, then using tab to move to another control.  Or just use Alt+b.</p>
<p>BTW, to the haters of auto-complete: once you get used to it it really is faster (honestly, they didn&#8217;t do all this research and come out with a technology what was slower).  But if you&#8217;re not used to it or don&#8217;t understand how it works it will slow you down and frustrate you.  For most apps that have some kind auto-complete feature there is a way to turn it off.</p>

		<p>Hexar:  That&#8217;s an option under Tools/Options, on the Edit tab, called &quot;Enable Autocomplete for cell values&quot;.  At least that&#8217;s where the option lives in Excel 2000; Excel 2003 should have it in a similar place. </p>
<p>If a software product like Excel has a feature you don&#8217;t like, such as Autocomplete, it might just turn out that opening the product&#8217;s Help and typing in some word like, oh, let&#8217;s say, Autocomplete (in the Answer wizard OR the Index, either one) will reveal a topic called &quot;Turn on or off automatically completing entries in columns&quot;.  The answer to changing the behavior is both discoverable and documented!</p>

		<p>Ooooooh yeah, did someone say Excel?  I haven&#8217;t tried Excel 2003 yet, but here&#8217;s that really neat autocomplete feature in earlier versions.  The way the IME works, often the Enter key is the only reasonable way to confirm the selected Kanji or even the plain input hiragana or katakana.  And in Excel, one press of the Enter key both does a confirmation to the IME and an unwanted autocomplete confirmation to Excel.  Then you can&#8217;t even just do a single backspace to back out of the unwanted autocompletion, you have to back out one character at a time (or use the mouse to select the autocompleted portion).  Why doesn&#8217;t it take two separate presses to do these two unrelated operations?  One keystroke to use the IME as normal.  Then offer the autocompletion and accept one more Enter keystroke to confirm or backspace or other input to kill the offered autocompletion.  Fortunately I don&#8217;t have to use Excel every day.</p>
<p>Oh and then there was the skilful typist who skilfully used autocomplete so that every program written by one person would be reassigned to join every program written by one other person, because both of those persons had the same first name.  Didn&#8217;t even have to use the Japanese version of Excel to do that.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
