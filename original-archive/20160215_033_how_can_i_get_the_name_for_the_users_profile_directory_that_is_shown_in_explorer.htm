A customer wanted to know how they could get the
<code>SHGet&shy;Localized&shy;Name</code> function to work.
Fortunately, they gave a specific definition of "work".
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
We are populating a list of folders, and we want the names to
be the same names that appear in Explorer.
We are diong it by calling
<code>SHGet&shy;Localized&shy;Name</code>,
and if it succeeds,
doing a
<code>Load&shy;Library&shy;Ex</code>
with
<code>LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE</code>,
and then a <code>Load&shy;String</code>.
(If the call to
<code>SHGet&shy;Localized&shy;Name</code> fails,
then we just use the raw file system name.)
This works for the most part, but not for the user profile.
How can we get the correct name for the user profile folder?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The
user profile name is not a localized name,
which is why
<code>SHGet&shy;Localized&shy;Name</code>
doesn't give you any information about it.
Instead, that name is dynamically generated based on the user
whose profile you are looking at.
(It's not like there's a giant <code>usernames.dll</code> which
includes the name of every possible user on the planet,
and
<code>SHGet&shy;Localized&shy;Name</code>
says "Oh, yeah, the user is Raymond Chen?
That's string number 31415 in <code>usernames.dll</code>.")
</p>
<p>
The way to get the name that Explorer displays for an item
is to ask the same data source that Explorer uses:
the shell namespace.
</p>
<p>
And hey, how about that, I already wrote a sample program that
shows how to do this,
just in the context of a different question,
so I'm going to incorporate the existing program by reference.

		<p>SHGetLocalizedName is too low level and was added to Vista because of the changes to SKU/languages but you had special folder names before this, XP had custom names for the document folders that included the username when you view them in My Computer IIRC.</p>
<p>The correct way of thinking about this is that you want the same name as Explorer and this is the shell displayname and various settings controls what this name looks like (with or without file extensions etc.) and it would be possible for MS to add a setting so you could disable the fancy userprofile name.</p>

		<p>Every time I read a question like this I wonder if the real problem is a lack of abstraction around the filesystem.  Explorer already &#8220;wraps&#8221; the underlying files and directories, so maybe it would make sense for there to be a virtual layer which automatically handles translations like this which could be used by Explorer as well as third party programs.  After all, while there are times a program does want to know the &#8220;real&#8221; file and folder names, don&#8217;t users usually want to see and interact with the localized and customized view?</p>
<p>Is that crazy? (or does it already exist and nobody uses it?)</p>

		<p>This layer of abstraction exists; it&#8217;s called &#8220;shell namespace&#8221;. It&#8217;s mentioned in the article you are commenting on.</p>

		<p>It does exist; IShellFolder &amp; IShellItem. The downside is that this is shell+COM and there are a lot of undocumented interfaces, try hosting those fancy control panel items that take over the whole view etc. (IExplorerBrowser solves some of these issues but removes too much control over the UI).</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>They used SHGet­Localized­Name on the user profile folder and it failed. Why the fail case (&#8220;use the raw file system name&#8221;) didn&#8217;t work for them? Let&#8217;s say a user is called Sara Kerrigan and her profile folder is QueenOfBlades.WINDOWS. Explorer shows the latter, not the former.</p>

		<p>It depends on where you see the folder in the namespace tree. Sure, inside c:\users it is a normal folder like any other but the folder might appear in other places (FOLDERID_UserFiles etc.) and is not the exact same thing when you stay in the PIDL/IShellFolder domain but once you convert the PIDL to a path you end up in filesystem land and there is no way back.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
