<p>A while back, I wrote on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/09/7034463.aspx"> the impact of hardworking employees on their less diligent colleagues</a>. <i>Slate</i> uncovered a study that demonstrated the reverse effect: <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2182671/"> How Tiger Woods makes everyone else on the course play worse</a>.</p>
<p> The magic ingredient is the incentive structure. If you have an incentive structure which rewards the best-performing person, and there is somebody who pretty much blows the rest of the field out of the water, then the incentive structure effectively slips down one notch. Everybody is now fighting for second place (since they've written off first place to Tiger Woods), and since the second place prize is far, far below the first place prize, people don't have as much incentive to play well as they did when Tiger wasn't in the mix. </p>
<p> The effect weakens the further down the ladder you go, for although the difference between first and second place is huge, the difference between 314th place and 315th place is pretty negligible. </p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Brown finds that competitors fare less wellâ€”about an extra stroke per tournament
</p></blockquote>
<p>An extra stroke per tournament doesn&#39;t seem like much.</p>
<p>Even if we suppose that it&#39;s statistically significant, it could just be due to riskier play (hit over the water rather than taking the safe fairway shot) trying to catch Tiger.</p>

<p>&quot;It holds the same also for who is watching the competition: already knowing almost for sure who&#39;s going to win takes away a lot of the fun.&quot;</p>
<p>Reminds me of a particular trend in my own sport of choice, practical shooting. One man (Rob Leatham) has won every single National Single-Stack Match since they first began in 1995 (first as the SSC, then as the combined SSC/USPSA SS National).</p>
<p>Speculation before the SS Nationals is usually relegated to &quot;who do you think will take second place&quot;.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the author thought about the idea that the golfers WERE trying harder to win, which resulted in them taking riskier shots thus leading to more mistakes. In my experiences golf is one of those games which trying harder tends to lead to playing worse.</p>

		<p>If so, then having a clear leader can be good for the sport. &nbsp;&quot;Risky golf&quot; is more exciting to watch (or less dull, depending on how you feel about golf in general.)</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve read about a similar story: There&#39;s a company which gives prize to the salesman who makes the highest amount of commission wach month. But as there&#39;s one of the salesman who always topped the others for sales, the &quot;up-charging&quot; effect fades away. Every other &nbsp;better salesman of the crowd just &quot;pretends&quot; the prize doesn&#39;t exist in order to protect their self-esteem (Note: Self-esteem is considered to be very important for salesman to work). The plan simply doesn&#39;t execute as it was planned.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve noticed, as a grad student in physics, that this is how things work here, too. &nbsp;A lot of grad students, and professors, look at what the top people in the field are doing and say &quot;well, I can&#39;t beat that&quot; and just spend their days watching youtube videos and screwing around, instead of learning, or doing, any physics. &nbsp;This results in a lot of physicists (e.g., most of the people you see in the media talking about physics, or writing pop-physics books, aside from a few exceptions) being extremely ignorant about the basics of their field. &nbsp;I&#39;ve heard anecdotally that similar things are true in other sciences, too.</p>

		<p>The double-edged sword here (albeit specific to the Tiger Woods example) is that Woods brought so much extra money into golf that *everyone* earned more. &nbsp;In 2010, Martin Kaymer&#39;s victory in the USPGA earned him $1.35million. &nbsp;In 1995, the last tournament pre-Tiger, Steve Elkington won, and picked up a cheque for $360k (about $500k, inflation adjusted). That&#39;s a 160% increase in real-terms, over 15 years. &nbsp;Elkington picked up half his winners cheque ($270k) in 2010 for being in a three-way tie for fifth.</p>
<p>Perhaps more surprising is that Tied-71st place was worth $3160 in 1995 (about $4400 in 2009 dollars). &nbsp;In 2010, Jeff Overton picked up $13,900 for finishing 72nd. &nbsp;Thats about a 200% increase.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
