		<p>That table&#8217;s logic makes my head hurt. :( &nbsp;Especially the dual meaning of STGM_FAILIFTHERE, since it can FAILIFNOTTHERE and SUCCEEDIFTHERE if fCreate is FALSE.</p>

		<p>The version on MSDN doesn&#8217;t say when the contents of the file are lost &#8211; seems potentially dangerous.</p>

		<p>This reminded me of the DOS OPEN function on the Spectrum +3, where you passed a &#8216;create action&#8217; saying what to do if the file didn&#8217;t exist, and an &#8216;open action&#8217; saying what to do if it did. These were 0-based integers, but my copy of the manual used a 1-based list to describe them, so you had to subtract 1 from all the values it gave.</p>
<p>I see there&#8217;s a (corrected) online copy at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXSpectrum128+3Manual/chapter8pt27.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXSpectrum128+3Manual/chapter8pt27.html</a></p>

		<p>I&#8217;m with Dan. &nbsp;FAILIFTHERE fails if the file is *not* there when fCreate is FALSE, which is rather counterintuitive.</p>

		<p>Yes, tables that cover every possibility are great! &nbsp;While your at it a table for VariantChangeType and/or variantchangetypeex would be great.</p>

		<p>(Disclaimer: I added the fCreate param to SHCreateStreamOnFileEx.) &nbsp;The reason for the weirdness is because STGM_FAILIFTHERE is a zero flag, and we had to work within the constraints of the existing STGM enumeration.</p>
<p>Zero flags sometimes make sense when you&#8217;re giving a name for default behavior but this one obviously didn&#8217;t work out that well.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that a Claimer? &nbsp;Doesn&#8217;t a Disclaimer mean you <em>don&#8217;t</em> have certain relationships to specified matters? &nbsp;For example when Usenet news postings used to identify which organization a writer was involved with, a disclaimer meant that that the posting wasn&#8217;t the organization&#8217;s official policy. &nbsp;For example, this comment wasn&#8217;t written by MSDN.</p>
<p>Metaclaim: &nbsp;Claimer wrote this metaclaim.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
