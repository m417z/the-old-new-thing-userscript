<p>A few years ago, <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2005/12/12/PM200512125.html"> Marketplace radio reported on the sub-industry of top ten lists</a>, specifically the lists intended to be used as gift guides. Marketing companies drool over these lists, since placement on them can mean a tremendous boost in sales, and they're anxious to do whatever it takes to get on the list. For example, <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> was a relatively unknown title until the American Booksellers Assocation placed it on their own "best picks" list.</p>
<p> In the story, <a href="http://www.cnet.com/">c|net</a> comes off looking good, standing their ethical ground against marketers looking for an endorsement. <i>The Today Show</i> doesn't fare as well. </p>

		<p>Which is where &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; should have stayed &#8211; it&#8217;s one of the worst books I&#8217;ve ever read&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;In the story, c|net comes off looking good, standing their ethical ground against marketers looking for an endorsement.&quot;</p>
<p>Which is terribly ironic seeing as they&#8217;ve just fired their editor-in-chief of the Gamespot division for daring to give a bad review to the game that had advertising plastered all over the site. (c|net maintains that he was fired for &#8216;concerns about tone&#8217;, even though the timking is suspicious and his staff are all making noises suggesting that the rumours surrounding the reason for his departure are true.)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not sure marketers drool over getting on every list, I know of atleast one I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d prefer to not be on:</p>

		<p>Wait until a toy with a rabid fanbase gets onto the #1 of the top-10 toys.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m talking about Transformers, which is big this year (no doubt due to the $700M grossing film (box office, world wide)). #1 is an expensive toy to get a kid (Transformers Ultimate Bumblebee), which nudged out the Nintendo Wii (now #2).</p>
<p>End result is that said toy is now ultra-hard to find everywhere except eBay. For a toyline that already suffers from scalping and such, it &nbsp;just makes it all that much harder to buy (especially since both adults *and* kids want it).</p>
<p>Honestly, I&#8217;ve seen a few, then the instant I saw the list come out, they disappear pretty darned quick.</p>
<p>So besides being the company&#8217;s best dream to get on these lists, it apparently is also the scalper&#8217;s dream list as well&#8230;</p>

<p>nah, HOTW2 wasn&#8217;t all that elaborate, although I <em>did</em> like the spaceballs flamethrower (kid at heart)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
