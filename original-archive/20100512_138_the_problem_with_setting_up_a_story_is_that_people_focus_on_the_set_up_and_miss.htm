<p>In writing, one of the steps you need to perform is motivating the discussion. Now, technically, you don't have to do that, but if you just dive into the guts of a topic right off the bat, people are going to say, "What the heck is going on and why should I care?"</p>
<p> Consider, for example, an article I wrote a while back on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/18/9233149.aspx"> how to use WMI to obtain computer configuration information</a>. To motivate the discussion, I considered a customer who wanted to collect computer manufacturer information programmatically (presumably for asset inventory purposes). But really, the reason wasn't important. It was just something for the script to do. If it weren't printing the computer manufacturer, it could have been getting the number of processors, or querying, I dunno, the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/11/25/9139860.aspx"> thermal state of the motherboard</a>. </p>
<p> Actually, the computer manufacturer was what I was after because of the bonus commentary regarding how computer manufacturer information is one of the things computer manufacturers often skimp on providing when they manufacture their computers. </p>
<p> Often it's not even the set-up but the placeholder itself that people fixate on. Consider, for example, my complaint about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/20/9341164.aspx"> repeated pony-begging</a>. Most people understood that the question itself was just a placeholder (and some people even <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/20/9341164.aspx#9354167"> joined</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/20/9341164.aspx#9371983"> in</a>), but you can always count on someone <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/20/9341164.aspx#9375588"> complaining about the placeholder</a>. </p>
<p> Another common problem is people who take <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/11/26/9143050.aspx"> an analysis of a specific case</a> and extrapolate it to all cases. There are places where you want to use bitfields, and places where you don't. It so happens that the example I chose was one of the ones where it wasn't. Some people interpreted this to mean that there were no cases where you would want to use bitfields. Remember, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/11/04/9917052.aspx"> good advice comes with a rationale so you can tell when it becomes bad advice</a>. These people skipped the rationale and just applied the advice blindly. </p>
<p> As an experiment, I've deleted the motivating preliminary discussion from tomorrow's article. It would have involved a little game of one-upsmanship between two Czech colleagues. (<b>Update</b>: Who, according to one commenter, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/12/10009451.aspx#10011822"> have no self-respect</a>.) </p>

		<p>I bet the preliminary discussion from tomorrow&#8217;s article was going to be about these two guys who were from the Czech Republic, became friends, and so on. With that gone, there will be nothing left but the punch line: &quot;Czech mate&quot;.</p>

		<p>Raymond, whatever point you were going to make in tomorrow&#8217;s article is invalid, because it&#8217;s spelled &quot;one-upmanship&quot; and no self-respecting Czech would ever engage in it.</p>

		<p>IMHO it&#8217;s usually a reflection that the person doesn&#8217;t get some piece of the puzzle. &nbsp;Even if they bothered to read the rationale there&#8217;s no time to write a rationale that doesn&#8217;t take a lot for granted.</p>
<p>These gaps, when it comes to software, seem more common in the mostly-self-taught types. &nbsp;At least that&#8217;s been my experience (I include myself back when I was mostly self-taught).</p>

<p>I hope I&#8217;m not jumping some sort of one-upmanship gun here (not that I&#8217;d engage in it), but the online Merriam-Webster dictionary lists &quot;one-upsmanship&quot; as a variant, so I&#8217;d say Raymond&#8217;s spelling (and probably the point in tomorrow&#8217;s article) is valid:</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that Raymond was addressing my comment or maybe I&#8217;m just too far out of my depth to understand.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s apparent that Raymond does have psychic one-upsmanship powers in addition to his psychic debugging powers. &nbsp;An awesome and aweful (sic) combination for a thermonuclear threat.</p>
<p>I eagerly await Raymond&#8217;s stock-picking psychic powers posts. &nbsp;But with my luck they&#8217;ll be pre-recorded for posting after the events he might discuss&#8230;</p>

		<p>I just want to say: I hate when people fixate on the placeholder. Even when I make an inordinate effort to indicate &quot;this is placeholder&quot;, people critique it anyway.</p>
<p>Reminds me of Duff&#8217;s Device, a method for partially unrolling a loop. As a placeholder, the original example of the device simply set memory. So of course the commenters, being the Id-10-t errors that they are, fixated on this and asked, &quot;Why not just use memcpy?&quot;. They completely ignored the clever pattern for partially unrolling a loop to make it more efficient in other contexts, and critiqued that one, single example. Do these people critique Hello World applications, too? (For example, why not just use &quot;echo Hello World&quot;?)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
