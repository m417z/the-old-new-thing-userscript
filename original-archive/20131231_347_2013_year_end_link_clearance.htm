<p> Another round of the semi-annual link clearance. </p>

<li>     <a href="http://labs.spotify.com/2013/06/18/creative-usernames/">     Creative usernames and Spotify account hijacking</a>.     This is a fascinating security issue caused by a helper library erroneously     assuming that the Unicode specification will never change.     It's also one of the nightmare scenarios for backward compatibility:     A change in behavior silently introduces a security vulnerability     into existing code. </li>
</ul>
<p> And, as always, the obligatory plug for my column in TechNet Magazine: </p>
<ul>
<li>     <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn283939.aspx">     The $700 pagers</a> </li>

<li>     <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn456530.aspx">     The mystery key</a> </li>
</ul>
<p> <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/"> The retirement of TechNet Magazine</a> also spells the end of the <i>Windows Confidential</i> column, so this is the last of the obligatory plugs, at least until I have some other obligatory thing to plug. </p>

		<p>You know how these things [undocumented registry keys] are found, right? Change the setting, diff the registry, and filter out irrelevant information. A lot of these actually work if you reboot after changing the setting.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#39;ve done it. Yes, I&#39;ve been very much prepared for it to break on the next Windows version.</p>

		<p>Coke seemed a little more sensitive about their competitors than another company we visited several years ago to demo our travel planning software. The company was Burger King headquarters, the demo was right after lunch, and the BK employees were just finishing their meal from Wendy&#39;s.</p>

		<p>Ed: The restaurant industry is peculiar like that. I happen to work for a major dining franchise, and we rarely get lunch from our own restaurants. Similarly, nobody thinks twice of dining at the establishment of one of our &quot;competitors.&quot; I suppose every brand is a unique experience and it&#39;s not really viewed as offensive or disloyal to patronize a different establishment; even if they compete with you in the casual, fast casual, fine, etc. space.</p>

		<p>Btw, in the $700 pagers story the pagers should have been bundled with Gameboy or GameGear.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think NDS has came out yet. :P</p>

		<p>Mark: I would assume it&#39;s because each fast food chain knows what&#39;s in its own &quot;food&quot;, and nobody in the know actually wants to eat it.</p>

<p>The problem is that when it stops working in ten years, but is a critical component of your company&#39;s 100-page login script, no one knows how to fix the problem.</p>

		<p>I was Okay with the retirement of the TechNet subscription since I saw first hand a lot of the piracy going on out there. &nbsp;But retiring TechNet Magazine is just plain painful. &nbsp;I LOVED my TechNet Magazine. &nbsp;The articles were great and, of course, I loved Mr. Chen&#39;s entries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to miss TechNet.</p>

		<p>I&#39;d love it if you started up a new side blog (The Old New Gaiden?) for an in-depth monthly column. Those are always fascinating in a different way from your regular blog.</p>

		<p>Please, whenever, if ever, do tell us about an upcoming obligatory plug.</p>
<p>Raymond, your established column is always among the best articles you can read in the (now archived) TechNet magazine issues. Well done.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
