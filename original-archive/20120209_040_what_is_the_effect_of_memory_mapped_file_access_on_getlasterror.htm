A customer was using memory-mapped files and was looking for
information as to whether access to the memory-mapped data
modifies the value returned by
<code>Get&shy;Last&shy;Error</code>.
A member of the kernel team replied,
"No, memory-mapped I/O does not ever change the value returned by
<code>Get&shy;Last&shy;Error</code>."
</p>
<p>
That answer is simultaneously correct and wrong,
a case of
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/12/10163578.aspx">
looking at the world through kernel-colored glasses</a>.
</p>
<p>
While it's true that the kernel does not ever change the value
returned by
<code>Get&shy;Last&shy;Error</code>,
it's also the case that
<i>you</i> might change it.
</p>
<p>
If you set up an exception handler, then your
exception handler might perform operations that affect
the last-error code, and those changes will be visible
after the exception handler returns.
(This applies to all exception handlers and filters,
not just ones related to memory-mapped files.)
</p>
<p>
If you intend to return
<code>EXCEPTION_<wbr>CONTINUE_<wbr>EXECUTION</code>
because you handled the exception,
then you probably should make sure to leave the last-error
code the way you found it.
Otherwise, the code that you interrupted and then resumed will have had its
last-error code changed asynchronously.
You just

sabotaged it from above</a>.

<i>// Code in italics is wrong

LONG ExceptionFilter(LPEXCEPTION_POINTERS ExceptionPointers)
{
 if (IsAnExceptionICanRepair(ExceptionPointers)) {
   RepairException(ExceptionPointers);
   // fixed up error; continuing
   return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION;
 }

 if (IsAnExceptionICanHandle(ExceptionPointers)) {
  // We cannot repair it, but we can handle it.
  return EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER;
 }

 // Not our exception. Keep looking.
 return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH;
}</i>
</pre>
<p>
If the <code>Is&shy;An&shy;Exception&shy;I&shy;Can&shy;Repair</code> function
or
<code>Repair&shy;Exception</code> function
does anything that affects the last-error code,
then when the exception filter is executed for a repairable
exception, the last-error code is magically changed without the
mainline code's knowledge.
All the mainline code did was execute stuff normally, and somehow
during a memory access or a floating point operation or some other
seemingly-harmless action, the last-error code spontaneously changed!
</p>
<p>
If you are going to continue execution at the point the exception was
raised, then you need to "put things back the way you found them"
(except of course for the part where you repair the exception itself).

		<p>yes, because if we break the error code in IsAnExceptionICanRepair or IsAnExceptionICanHandle, return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH and some other handler can handle it they restore a bad error code.</p>

		<p>&quot;Exercise: Why isn&#39;t it important to restore the last error code if you return EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER?&quot;</p>
<p>The code path changes (the _except path is taken immediately), so the last error code does not change &quot;magically&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exercise: Is it important to restore the last error code if you return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH? &quot;</p>
<p>Yes, if another exception handler repairs the exception and returns an EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION, that exception handler sees your last exception.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: By not using the same name with different capitalization for the class and the instance. &nbsp;That&#39;s just confusing and makes the code harder to read. &nbsp;That&#39;s one of the reasons why I prefer case insensitive languages. &nbsp;No case sensitivity = no case sensitivity abuse.</p>

		<p>@Mason Wheeler:</p>
<p>It&#39;s not an abuse. &nbsp;It&#39;s a common idiom in case sensitive languages that types have an initial capital letter and variables do not. &nbsp;Thus, if one understands the culture of the language in use, there is no confusion. &nbsp;And by using the same name, the type becomes very easy to infer.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen this recommended in both Java and Objective-C (languages I use daily).</p>

		<p>This isn&#39;t really a matter of case sensitivity. Keep in mind that the following code would function exactly the same way:</p>
<p>PreserveLastError PreserveLastError;</p>
<p>I feel that the real issue is whether or not to use a class designed in this way. I feel that it&#39;s not intuitive to declare a variable (apparently unused) in order to preserve the error code. It is, however, quite practical.</p>

		<p>@Mason Wheeler: I&#39;d agree with you if you were editing your code in 1990. But this is 2012, every code editor has color-coding, and there&#39;s no confusion involved because type names have a different color from variable names.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not using color-coding, then I&#39;d say the problem exists between keyboard and chair.</p>

		<p>@James I don&#39;t even see the problem in 1990. Classes start with an uppercase letter, variables with a lowercase one.

		<p>I don&#39;t like using variables like this preserveLastError whose only purpose is to effect a change on construction and destruction &#8212; some ignorant programmer could just come along and say &quot;oh hey, it looks like this variable isn&#39;t being used for anything, I&#39;ll just delete it&quot;, and suddenly your program breaks in impossible ways two months later.</p>
<p>Yes, the class and variable are well-named in this case, and you should avoid trying to work with obtuse programmers as much as possible, but it&#39;s still a possibility to worry about. &nbsp;I&#39;m particularly fond of the &quot;explicit is better than implicit&quot; rule from the Zen of Python.</p>

		<p>@Adam Rosenfield: The problem is, C++ doesn&#39;t let you do this explicitly. You could add an explicit GetLastError() to the beginning and a RestoreLastError() before every return, but then you aren&#39;t exception-safe: any exception will prevent the code from restoring the error code.</p>
<p>The exception-safe explicit way would be a try-finally construct, but C++ doesn&#39;t support that. All you can do is writing a class for every possible cleanup scenario, and declare an instance of that class any time you need that specific cleanup code.</p>

		<p>Won&#39;t your printf() call potentially change the value of GetLastError() too? &nbsp;That&#39;s not a signal safe function on Unix (where it can do bad things like acquire C runtime library mutexes that could already be held), so I&#39;m suprised to see it used in a Windows exception handler.</p>

		<p>@Evan: Well, I wouldn&#39;t call what ~PreserveLastError() does in this example &quot;resource cleanup&quot;. I guess that&#39;s why this solution bothers me &#8212; if the destructor would truly just clean up resources acquired in the constructor, no one would be surprised. I believe that the Java equivalent:</p>
<p>int lastError = GetLastError();</p>
<p>try {</p>
<p>&nbsp;// do stuff</p>
<p>} finally {</p>
<p>&nbsp;RestoreLastError(lastError);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>is both more explicit and more readable than the C++ code:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&nbsp; PreserveLastError preserveLastError;</p>
<p>&nbsp; // do stuff</p>
<p>} // Note: the last error is magically restored here</p>
<p>Maybe the Java version is prone to copy-pasting (as you didn&#39;t abstract your setup and restoration into separate methods), but at least you can clearly see that something <em>is</em> happening at the end of the block.</p>

		<p>PreserveLastError is a proper use of the RAII idiom, though I agree that an explanatory comment would be worthwhile. &nbsp;I really like D&#39;s scope(exit) construct; thankfully, with C++11, you can recreate its semantics. &nbsp;The following code works in VC10 and VC11:</p>

<p>class do_at_scope_exit</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>public:</p>
<pre><code>do_at_scope_exit(Callback cb) : callback(cb) { }

~do_at_scope_exit() { callback(); }
</code></pre>
<p>private:</p>
<pre><code>Callback callback;
</code></pre>
<p>};</p>
<p>#define PASTE(a, b) PASTE2(a, b)</p>
<p>#define PASTE2(a, b) a ## b</p>
<p>template &lt;class Callback&gt;</p>
<p>do_at_scope_exit&lt;Callback&gt; at_scope_exit_do(Callback cb) { return do_at_scope_exit&lt;Callback&gt;(cb); }</p>
<p>#define at_scope_exit(cb) auto PASTE(at_scope_exit, <strong>COUNTER</strong>) = at_scope_exit_do(cb)</p>
<p>// &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>// Use case:</p>
<p>LONG ExceptionFilter(LPEXCEPTION_POINTERS ExceptionPointers)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll confess that my initial thought once saw it is that I can&#39;t see any read or write action to it, so it should be removed.</p>
<p>It would be better if some comments can be put beside the code, I think.</p>

		<p>@Adam, Csaboka:</p>
<p>Further, even *if* C++ had try-finally, using that for resource cleanup is, at least I think, super obnoxious. Deterministic destructors are way better. The only solutions that I consider comparable are something like Python&#39;s &#39;with&#39; or C#&#39;s &#39;using&#39; and D&#39;s &#39;scope(exit)&#39;.</p>

		<p>@Joshua et aliae:</p>
<p>Standard idiom in used language, self-explanatory names, and you still want to add a comment?</p>
<p>Why don&#39;t you explain every token, be it comment or source code, as well?</p>
<p>Thus you&#39;d be in serious danger of drowning in a sea of irrelevance, not able to find the one and only important insight hidden in all the clutter.</p>

		<p>Of course you have to take care not to write PreserveLastError(); by mistake. Or maybe</p>
<p>#define PreserveLastError() PreserveLastError preserveLastError</p>
<p>(This does not work for typical RAII classes that need parameters, of course.)</p>

		<p>Clearly ;-) the best way is:</p>
<p>WithErrorSaved last_err_trash;</p>
<p>&quot;trash&quot; would signal I know I&#39;m not using it, and &quot;With&quot; would indicate RAII. &nbsp;Like <code>with open(fname) as f: ...</code> in Python.</p>

		<p>@Deduplicator &#8211; For most developers, their code code does not cease to be used once it is complied. As someone who spends a lot of time reading other people&#39;s code, often written in languages in which I do not regularly write myself, you&#39;d be hard pressed to over-comment code. Making assumptions about the depth of familiarity of your reader with the the language is a mistake.</p>
<p>Comments are a beautiful thing to accelerate others understanding of the INTENT fo your code. Since developers are not perfect, their code sometimes deviates fronm their intent. Comments help ME to find YOUR mistakes.</p>

		<p>@Steve: You have to assume that a craftsman can use his tools, else he shouldn&#39;t be &quot;crafting&quot;. This is about who to optimize the readability for. A developer or a non-developer?</p>
<p>You should only comment the non-obvious. RIAA is obvious in C++.</p>
<p>Also, as Agile suggest, there is no developer who write poor code and good comments. It&#39;s either poor code+lying comments OR self explaining code+redundant comments.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
