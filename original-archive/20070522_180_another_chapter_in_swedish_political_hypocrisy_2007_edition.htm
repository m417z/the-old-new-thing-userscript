<p>A few years ago, Gudrun Schyman, then-leader of Sweden's left-wing party, V&auml;nsterpartiet ("The Left Party"), was <a href="http://www.sr.se/Ekot/artikel.asp?artikel=517147"> forced to resign</a> after it was revealed that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/08/48617.aspx#48859"> she had been cheating on her taxes for at least five years</a>, specifically by claiming fake deductions. This was particularly ironic because, as the left-wing party, V&auml;nsterpartiet is heavily pro-taxation.</p>
<p> The latest news from Sweden comes from the opposite end of the political spectrum. The far right-wing party Sverigedemokraterna ("The Sweden Democrats"), which has an anti-immigrant platform, have complained that 10% of immigrants live on government assistance, double the rate of native Swedes. Swedish tabloid <a href="http://www.aftonbladet.se/"> Aftonbladet</a> did some legwork and calculated that <a href="http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,1071526,00.html"> nearly 20% of Sverigedemokraterna members live on government assistance</a>, and over a third receive partial government assistance. (<a href="http://www.thelocal.se/7332/20070517/">In English</a>, and less sensationally written.) </p>
<p> If you dare to click through to the Swedish version, I can at least try to translate the <a href="http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/0705/17/stats_368.jpg"> chart</a>: The left hand column shows the average annual income of members of the various parties (sd&nbsp;=&nbsp;Sverigedemokraterna) in Swedish kronor. The right hand column shows the percentage of members with, um, something; having trouble translating. It literally means "payment notices" but I'm not sure what that means. The white boxes marked "Riket" show the national averages. And the little graph in the lower left corner shows the percentage of sd members (compared to the national average) who owe money to the <a href="http://www.kronofogden.se/">Swedish Enforcement Authority</a>, which collects fines, fees, taxes, legal judgments, and similar monetary obligations. </p>
<p> No scandal article from Aftonbladet is complete without some mean-spirited fun, and in this case, they decided to <a href="http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/0705/17/stapel_368.jpg"> add some new data to a bar chart</a> taken from one of Sverigedemokraterna's political pamphlets. </p>
<p> <b>Nitpicker's corner</b> </p>
<p> There's plenty of hypocrisy in United States politics, too. </p>

		<p>The &quot;payment notices&quot; is something you don&#8217;t want to have in Sweden. Basically, if you don&#8217;t pay your bills, you will get a reminder. If you still don&#8217;t pay, if the supplier (the landlord, electricity company, phone company, &#8230;) is nice, you will get another reminder. If you still don&#8217;t pay, the supplier will apply at the &quot;Kronofogden&quot; (Swedish Enforcement Administration) to collect the money. This is registered. Whenever you want to make open a new cell phone subscription, buy an internet connection subscription, rent and apartment, pretty much anything that means that you get some sort of credit from a company, the supplier will run a check, and these things will show up. If you have one or more of these you are immediately considered to be a bit suspicious, and some companies will just plain refuse to do business with you.</p>

		<p>Is this really hypocrisy though? In the UK, the far right BNP gets most of it&#8217;s support from people who are economically marginalised. So they tend to live in areas with cheap or state owned housing, lots of crime and lots of asylum seekers (because of the cheap/state housing). They also have a higher chance of being on benefits. </p>
<p>Given that there is limited amount of resources for state benefits so people effectively compete for them, and asylum seekers often have priority, is it really surprising that people like this are less tolerant of immigration than people who never have to deal with the benefit system?</p>
<p>It seems that it&#8217;s only hypocrisy of you think that the asylum seekers have a right to UK benefits, and most BNP supporters don&#8217;t agree with this &#8211; I suppose they want entitlement to be restricted to people who have paid enough tax to fund benefits, and no more asylum seekers be admitted. You may or may not agree with this position, and it is certainly somewhat selfish, but it is not hypocritical. </p>
<p>Now central government does believe that asylum seekers should be able to claim benefits, in fact it signed up to the 1951 UN Refugee convention which means it has to, but the actually financial cost is passed to local government. </p>
<p>If anything, I&#8217;d say that the hypocrisy lies with people in middle class areas who support the idea that asylum seekers can claim benefits, but move to areas which are too expensive to house them so their taxes are not affected, and their kids can go to schools where ethnic minorities are under represented rather than over represented. </p>

		<p>Hehe, thanks for keeping me updated on Sweden too, Raymond. There&#8217;s a lot written about SD in Sweden these days but this was the funniest (especially the last chart).</p>
<p>I guess I kind of agree with Wilhelm, it seems the further from the middle ground you stray, the more nuts you are (become). Now all we have to do is define the middle&#8230;</p>

<p>&gt; The &#8216;payment notice&#8217; count the number of times</p>
<p>&gt; they have defaulted on a loan or payed a bill</p>
<p>&gt; late enough that it&#8217;s been handled by a</p>
<p>&gt; collection agency.</p>
<p>They deserve congratulations. &nbsp;In contrast, in some countries, payment notices count the number of times that the victim has been *accused* of defaulting or paying late. &nbsp;Every libel, including accusations submitted by criminal operators, counts against the victim.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in a country that can&#8217;t be named (since it&#8217;s neither Sweden nor US), a politician who was in charge of reforming the pension system didn&#8217;t pay his pension premiums, and an actress who was hired for TV commercials trying to persuade people to pay their pension premiums didn&#8217;t pay hers.</p>

		<p>The article and the survey were about Sverigedemokratarne politicians, not party members. I&#8217;m not sure if this makes it more hypocritical or not, but I&#8217;m betting that the politicians *have* read the party program.</p>
<p>&quot;Men i en unik kartl&#228;ggning kan Aftonbladet visa att de folkvalda sd-politikerna sj&#228;lva kostar v&#228;lf&#228;rden miljonbelopp och att n&#228;ra 20 procent av dem lever p&#229; sjukpension.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But in a unique survey Aftonbladet can show that the elected SD politicians themselves cost welfare services millions of kronor and that almost 20 % live on welfare for health reasons.&quot;</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I&#8217;m not Swedish, but being Norwegian I read it easily.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
