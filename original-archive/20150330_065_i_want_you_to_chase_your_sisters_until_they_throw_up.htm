<p>A friend of mine grew up in a rural area. The family got their water from a well and had to fluoridate it manually with tablets.</p>
<p> When my friend was a little girl, she was playing around the house with one of her friends (let's call her friend Alice). They got into the kitchen cabinet and found these candy-like things and ate them. When her mother discovered that they had eaten fluoride tablets, she called the poison control center for advice. In addition to telling her to give the girls something-or-other, they instructed her to keep the girls moving until they vomited up the tablets. </p>
<p> As it happens, my friend's brother and Alice's brother were playing outside. The boys were called inside, informed of what happened, and instructed to keep their sisters moving and try to get them to throw up. </p>
<p> The boys couldn't believe their ears. You want us to chase our sisters until they throw up? This must be what heaven is like! </p>
<p> The boys assumed their responsibilities with great enthusiasm, chasing the girls around the yard, putting them in a swing and spinning them around, all the stuff brothers dream of doing to torment their sisters, but this time they could do it without fear of punishment. Fortunately, the story had a happy ending. The girls soon vomited up the tablets and thereby avoided two horrible fates: (1)&nbsp;fluoride poisoning and (2)&nbsp;being forced to endure torture from their brothers in perpetuity. </p>

		<p>One of the most enduring memories of our (i.e. My youngest sister and I) childhood is pseudo-tickle the sister in between us (i.e. put our hands NEAR her tummy and PRETEND we are tickling her). But she would rolling on the floor laughing uncontrollably and begging us to stop. And we would say: &#39;Stop what? We aren&#39;t even touching you!&#39;</p>

		<p>I never had a sister &#8212; two brothers. &nbsp;If my parents had told me to terrorize one of the others until they puked, I can assure all that I would have done my duty as a good son! &nbsp; :)</p>

		<p>I think it&#39;s great they fluoridated the water themselves (rather than having no fluoridation at all). &nbsp;We&#39;ve had fluoridation in our city&#39;s water for a few years now but there was a scare campaign when it first came in to the point where the ignorance was fashionable enough to wear on your sleeve. &nbsp;It was fun to point out that tap water also had chlorine added to it :)</p>

		<p>Actually I wonder for a long time&#8230; why should we fluoridate water if we already have plenty of fluoride in our toothpaste?</p>

		<p>@cheong00: I wonder the opposite: why bother with the toothpaste if it&#39;s in the water. &nbsp;You can&#39;t help drinking, but brushing teeth is work.</p>

		<p>@Mark VY: Toothpaste contains ingredients that repair / written your teeth, relieve your sensitivity teeth and so on. But the primary use is to reduce the friction damage to teeth surface.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
