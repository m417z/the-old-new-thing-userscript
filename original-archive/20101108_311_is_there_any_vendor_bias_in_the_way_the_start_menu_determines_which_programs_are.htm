<p><a href="http://netnerds.net/"> Chrissy</a> wants to know <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#2364924"> if there is a bias towards Microsoft products in the selection of most frequently used programs on the Start menu</a>.</p>
<p> The only bias is in the initial default MFU list, the one that appears upon a fresh login. In Windows&nbsp;XP, the default Start menu MFU contains six slots. The first three point to Windows applications, and the second three point to programs chosen by the OEM. (If the OEM chooses not to take advantage of this feature, or if this is a boxed version of the product, then the second three slots also point to Windows applications.) Which specific three (or six) programs get displayed depend on the system configuration, so it's not like there's a single initial Start menu that applies to everyone. </p>
<p> Once those initial MFU items are selected, the Start menu algorithm proceeds in a vendor-blind manner. (Indeed, it doesn't even know who the vendor is; no part of the algorithm looks at file version information.) </p>
<p> The precise algorithm that is used for determining which programs go on the MFU over time has been reviewed by government-appointed regulators, who have not raised any concerns over vendor bias. </p>
<p> So I hate to say it, Chrissy, but I think it's all in your head. </p>

		<p>So, does &quot;depends on system configuration&quot; means that it&#39;s pseudo random with the seed depending on the hardware? Or is it just the classical &quot;no particular order&quot;, but without non installed components?</p>

		<p>@Henke37: &nbsp;I think it means &quot;Home&quot; versions of the OS get one set, while &quot;Professional&quot; versions get a different set.</p>
<p>Now, while I&#39;ve never noticed a vendor bias, there does seems to be some form of bias. &nbsp; I&#39;ve noticed that when I search for an application from the start menu, and then run it, it never appears on the MRU list. &nbsp;(Oddly, the two never-MRU-ed apps I searched&amp;ran most often were both MS app: Calc &amp; Spider Solatary &#8212; completely blowing Chrissy thesis)</p>

		<p>It might be a more subtle bias. There could be some negative bias to prevent useless items (for instance, READMEs and Uninstalls) from appearing on that list; Microsoft programs might be more well-engineered in such a way that they happen to avoid that negative bias. That is, all bias towards Microsoft programs would be both accidental and caused by mistakes on other vendor&#39;s programs.</p>

		<p>@ZamesCurran my guess is that when you do a search on the start bar it&#39;s just a wrapper around the normal file searching stuff. So when you launch a program from that search you are really launching it like you had launched it from the file it&#39;s in, not from the start bar. As a result the start bar can&#39;t keep track of the fact that you launched it and put it in the MRU list.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&#39;t the fact that the start menu is prepopulated with certain Microsoft programs introduce a certain bias toward those programs staying there? Since they are there already it&#39;s more likely that they would stay there. They&#39;re like program incumbents.</p>

		<p>The algorithm seems somewhat broken in my case. &nbsp;For example, RealTerm is at the top of the list although I haven&#39;t launched that for months, but I&#39;ve launched Quick Books at least 6-8 times in the last month and it appears nowhere.</p>

		<p>@Mike Kelly: &nbsp;Yes, but how many times have you run RealTerm? &nbsp;If it&#39;s been run hundreds of times, and Quick Books 10, then the odds are the latter simply hasn&#39;t been promoted enough yet. &nbsp;I&#39;ve observed this exact behavior before. &nbsp;In fact if you really want to know, start deleting things from your MRU list and watch: &nbsp;eventually QB should show up.</p>

		<p>@ZamesCurran: I believe only shortcuts are eligble for listing in the MRU applications section; if you&#39;re searching, you&#39;re probably starting the apps directly.</p>

		<p>The Start menu should show programs in order of coolness, then popularity, then usefulness, then cuteness. This ordering should be determined by a Government appointed body, running a weekly global survey that people can either choose to take part in or choose to pay much higher taxes. Every year, a Start menu King and Queen would be elected, to represent the menu in human form.</p>
<p>That should satisfy everyone.</p>

		<p>I manually pin all the programs I use to my start menu (and set the &quot;MRU size&quot; to zero), so I never notice anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>Really frequently used programs get pinned to the taskbar, slightly less frequently used programs get pinned to the start menu, and everything else I just use search.</p>

		<p>&quot;Every year, a Start menu King and Queen would be elected&quot;</p>
<p>When Kings and Queens ascend to the throne unmerited, they often do so by assassination. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This nicely parallels the situation with the MRU because, since there is no programmatic access to the MRU, ascension without merit requires similar behind-the-scenes underhandedness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, if your app (for example) fakes user-input to launch itself 1000&#39;s of times to get to the top of the MRU, it is only following in the traditions of humanity&#39;s ruling elite. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Wow, 640K has some interesting &quot;issues&quot;.</p>
<p>I will humour him/her by responding to one point raised though&#8230;</p>
<p>WMP has not been removed altogether in the EU. There is the option of buying a WMP-less version of windows, but I don&#39;t think it actually sells at all.</p>
<p>It seems I&#39;m not the only one who prefers WMP as my player of choice.</p>

		<p>I forget what my MRU list looked like in XP, but in 7, it seems pretty fair to me. The top six programs on my list are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visual Studio</li>
<li>
<p>Media Player Classic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQL Server Management Studio (ugh)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wireshark</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Command Prompt</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of those, #s 3 and 4 are programs that I&#39;ve only been using recently, but frequently, and so have bubbled up the list.</p>
<p>One thing I&#39;m curious about is if taskbar-pinned programs also rack up MRU points. I&#39;ve got Firefox and Winamp pinned (amongst other things) because I use them all the time, but aren&#39;t on the MRU list. I don&#39;t know if this is a factor of them being pinned or of them never being closed :)</p>

		<p>The startmenu MRU might be fair, but the Open With menu is not. Windows Media Player is always at the top. But I suspect this is a (XP?) bug since WMP uses a different method of registration compared to other apps that end up in that list after normal usage.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s my understanding that most copies of XP N were purchased by mistake.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;ve done some testing on N versions, and ironically many 3rd party media players failed to install or run because they depend on Windows Media binaries, in case someone wants to play a .AVI/.WMA or such file in them&#8230; You&#39;d think that the third party media player makers would at least do a quick check on the version made for their benefit.</p>
<p>One scenario I found was using a 3rd party web browser with a 3rd party media player set as default&#8230; when opening a .mpeg file online it kept opening in WMP&#8230; because the media player only registered .MPG and .MPEG and the browser trucated file extensions to 3 characters (.MPE) when looking for matching players. Someone could easily paint that as WMP being evil, but it was just a combination of a lame bug-fix (a previous version of that browser had a buffer-overrun exploit in filenames) and a file type registration oversight by the media player.</p>
<p>When you trip over something and smack your head on the floor, don&#39;t blame the floor.</p>

		<p>@640k:</p>
<p>Obviously Windows shouldn&#39;t come with a media player, just like OS X, KDE and GNOME don&#39;t come with media players.</p>
<p>I have no issues with how Windows does its start menu entries; if I really, truly need an item, I&#39;ll just pin to the menu! I prefer how Vista and Windows 7 do the start menu, because it&#39;s much easier to find items that aren&#39;t on the menu using the search bar.</p>

<p>One could also wounder why the government-appointed regulators would need to look into the start menu logic. Sometimes in the past there was of course a bias.

		<p>Do I understand correctly then that the &quot;remove from this list&quot; option just takes away the program&#39;s current accumulation of points rather then banning it? I have been assuming that that was a banhammer and avoiding it. I might not be using the program NOW but I might use it someday. I would rather have a deleveler then a blacklist. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>@prunoki:</p>
<p>I was employing irony in my reply. I have no issues with an OS having a media player (or anything else for that matter!) I also don&#39;t really care about where said applications show up in a menu initially; they can be random for all I know.</p>

		<p>Just so you know, I would have bought Windows Server 2003 N if it existed.</p>
<p>Of course that need doesn&#39;t exist now as Windows Server 2008 R2 doesn&#39;t install Media Player by default.</p>

		<p>What I don&#39;t understand is if I run program as another user, the Start menu still counted that as MFU point. The Start menu also put the document that was opened to recently opened items, which is pretty useless IMO, not to mention some sort of information disclosure.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
