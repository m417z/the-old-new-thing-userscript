<p> The desktop window manager is not actually part of the shell. It operates at the window manager level. (Notice that DWM is active even when Explorer isn't running.) You probably should have posted your suggestion to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/greg_schechter/archive/2006/03/25/561167.aspx"> Greg Schechter's request for DWM topics</a> which was not too old at the time you posted your topic suggestion. But then again, "Best practices for applications under the DWM" was on his list of future topics, so it looks like what you wanted was already on his to-do list. I don't know whether he followed up on his own to-do list, though. If not, you can always consult the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa969536(VS.85).aspx"> Performance Considerations and Best Practices (for using DWM)</a> topic in MSDN. </p>

		<p>Anyone know if Greg Schechter is still working on DWM, or if there&#8217;s a better person/place to direct DWM-related questions/feedback to these days?</p>
<p>I found a bug in the DWM Thumbnail API that crashes DWM.exe when you alt-tab, if you aren&#8217;t careful how you use the API, but not sure where to send it.</p>
<p>(Also have a question about whether it&#8217;s possible to detect when DWM is doing the window-open animation for a window.)</p>
<p>Have been playing around with the DWM API recently and it&#8217;s let me do some neat stuff.</p>

		<p>With Intel graphics drivers, switching the Windows 7 Magnifier to Docked mode makes DWM crash and not restart the service.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s a flawless argument for posting it here, where it&#8217;s guaranteed to get fixed&#8230;</p>

		<p>Of course MS can&#8217;t have a public bugtracking system, that&#8217;s like admitting, err, that they have bugs.</p>

		<p>As the monthly updates show, MS is well aware of bugs in there products. A public bugtracker, on the other hand, requires a certain savviness on part of the submitter, for not everything that looks like a bug *is* a bug. If MS created a public bugtracker, they would be *swamped* in bogus and duplicate bug reports.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
