		<p>I see your psychic powers have developed beyond debugging &#8211; you predicted Michael&#8217;s death (and the conversation with said children) a year in advance!</p>

		<p>Falcon, I think he wrote that post &#8216;just in case&#8217; Michael Jackson dies, and set it to publish a few days after.</p>

		<p>Jon,</p>
<p>I think the above comments were meant in a light hearted manner.</p>
<p>And yes, I loved those pre-emptive comments, sometimes they were the best part of the story! :)</p>

		<p>@RJ: I agree, and I can confirm that regarding my comment.</p>
<p>Also, this is hardly the first time an entry has jumped the queue: look at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/03/9529929.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/03/9529929.aspx</a></p>

		<p>Or maybe, just maybe, Raymond is smart enough to *both* have a queue *and* be able to insert entries at the front of it.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t make the pre-emptive comments come back. &nbsp;Or worse still, make Raymond stop blogging.</p>

		<p>Raymond wouldn&#8217;t be the first to predict Michael&#8217;s death&#8230;</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/06/the-gap-michael-jackson039s-online-death.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/06/the-gap-michael-jackson039s-online-death.html</a></p>
<p>Seems several other news sites predicted it in advance, as well!</p>

		<p>It is not fair to prioritize queues for dead people. Michael Jackson should have waited his turn.</p>

		<p>&quot;DOCTOR WHO WAS WITH MICHAEL JACKSON WHEN HE DIED&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s incredibly stupid. How could a TV show be with someone?</p>
<p>(&quot;Doctor Who&quot; is the name of the show, not the character. Obsessive fans take this common misconception very seriously. Not that I&#8217;m obsessive fan, oooh no.)</p>

		<p>Regarding the original blog&#8230;</p>
<p>I wonder what&#8217;s going on here. Has the five-year-old learned that euphemisms are generally used in such cases, but the two-year-old hasn&#8217;t? Or is the older one using it for her *own* benefit and the younger one doesn&#8217;t understand death enough to care? Or perhaps they are just teasing each other (in which case I think the younger one gets the points!).</p>

		<p>That 2 (now 3) year old is damn smart, learned to lie at 2, knows what death is at 3.</p>
<p>I just hope that kid gets to evolve on her own instead of expected social behavior pushed into her mind.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
