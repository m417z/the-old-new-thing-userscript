<p>A friend of mine told me about a project he worked on two decades (and three employers) ago. Let's call it <i>Project Nosebleed</i>. Their project used a client-managed database: You have a central file server that houses the database files, which were in a proprietary file format that only the clients understood. All the client applications open the database files, co&ouml;rdinating&sup1; access among themselves by using file and record locking primitives. All you needed the server for was a place to house the files. It could have been a NAS server for all anybody cared. (Well, except that the concept of NAS hadn't taken hold yet at the time of this story.)</p>
<p> The company sold two products. One was simply called <i>Nosebleed</i>, which was the program that ran on the client machines. The client program connected to the central file server and updated the files as appropriate. </p>
<p> What I found puzzling was that they also sold a <i>Nosebleed Server</i> product. I mean, the database is completely client-managed. No actual code runs on the server. What the heck is there for this alleged Server product to do? </p>
<p> My friend took pity on me and told me the answer: The server product is used to create the database files and perform database maintenance activities. </p>
<p> But I still found it ironic that a client-managed system has a server product. I suspect the business folks figured they could make a lot more money by breaking the program into two products. </p>
<p> &sup1; I am an old fogey who learned to spell <i>co&ouml;rdinate</i> with the diaersis, <i>Hallowe'en</i> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/31/910274.aspx#913021"> with the apostrophe</a>, and was taught to use an apostrophe to pluralize numbers. I still spell that way out of habit, and because I know my readers <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/06/07/10424279.aspx"> love arguing about it</a>. </p>

		<p>Kevin: I get nothing for &#39;coördinate&#39;, but here are some results without the diaersis:</p>
<p>&quot;When I say that it is your responsibility to coordinate an object&#39;s use from multiple threads &#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#8230; every Monday, the plants get double-watered. There&#39;s no standard protocol for multiple housekeeping services to coordinate their activities; &#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have to coordinate with those other teams and let them know what your transition plan is so they can work it into their schedule.&quot;</p>

		<p>Remember that the ö is also used in the names Zoë and Chloe, and for the same purpose. &nbsp;(Or you can take the somewhat silly way and name your daughter Zooey, but run the risk of it being pronounced differently/wrong.)</p>

		<p>Shouldn&#39;t it be spelled &#39;coårdinate&#39;?</p>

<p>What would you propose? It already has a tittle on the lower-case &quot;I&quot;. I&#39;m not seeing anything in &quot;Ponify&quot; that could be confused for a diphthong, in English at least, so no diæresis.</p>

		<p>If you will forgive me for not joining in the fascinating diaeresis debate, I would like to comment on the observation that it could have been a NAS server before the concept was invented, and suggest that the concept existed &#8211; what hadn&#39;t yet happened was that people had not yet forgotten about it in order for someone to come to market with a familiar product under an unfamiliar name and sell the same bundle of old rope to a market obsessed with &quot;new&quot; technology.</p>
<p>After all, what is a NAS server if not just a good old fashioned &quot;file server&quot; with a fancier job title ?</p>

		<p>I can certainly imagine the following progression:</p>
<p>1. Project Nosebleed is officially a client-only product, that being its selling point.</p>
<p>2. Devs write some management tools, because, well, they&#39;re needed.</p>
<p>3. Some marketing guy hears about those, and decides to market them as overpriced Server product (maybe in an Enterprise bundle), thus diluting the &quot;client-only&quot; selling point.</p>

<p>A couple decades ago, a file server was a high-end computer that ran Novell, which could host apps as NLMs, or one of a variety of general-purpose OSes (Unix, Windows NT, DOS, OS/2) that had networking services available.</p>
<p>The first Network Appliance, which was a specially designed piece of hardware with a custom OS whose only purpose was sharing files, had only just been released then. Since nobody had heard of it, and the term &quot;NAS&quot; had not yet been coined, Raymond is correct to say that the concept of NAS &quot;hadn&#39;t taken hold yet&quot;.</p>

		<p>Maybe they just wanted to make sure clients were not too independent and kept paying.</p>
<p>And the server probably validated licensing too&#8230;</p>

		<p>My NAS server has Linux inside and runs apps with Web interface, e.g. torrent.</p>
<p>Regarding the split decision, it&#39;s license that matters. If an organization needs one &quot;server&quot; license and 20 &quot;client&quot; licenses, it&#39;s much easier to set the Server price at 20*client price, and all sides of the deal are satisfied. True, the actual development effort for the former is 1/10th of the latter, but giving it the &quot;Server&quot; tag makes pricing sound reasonable.</p>
<p>There is actually another option, quite popular nowadays: sell a NAS with the Server product at 3*normal NAS price, call the bundle &quot;certified Nosebleed server&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Gabe: &quot;A NAS server is just an appliance just for file serving. It is not a general-purpose server that happens to only run a file sharing service.&quot;</p>
<p>Um, I don&#39;t think you will find many NAS servers that do just file serving and nothing else. &nbsp;They also typically provide printer sharing, media serving, download management and, since they typically run commodity OS&#39;s and/or provide a mechanism for installing and running &quot;extensions&quot; etc, they very much are general purpose devices, just ones that are deployed to a specific purpose.</p>
<p>Just like &quot;file servers&quot; in fact.</p>

		<p>I remember a NAS server that could serve CDs and DVDs directly from the optical drive, image them to the HDD and serve them from there and also write discs.</p>
<p>It had a custom motherboard, presumably with custom firmware, in a 5.25&quot; drive bay unit. It ran a Socket 7 AMD processor.</p>

		<p>The fact you need to buy a separate server may simply be a reflection of their pricing model. Just like Windows, you pay $X per server and $Y per client. Their software model didn&#39;t reflect that by default, but a simple change here could.</p>
<p>One reason may be a competing product used such a server pricing model, or that market research showed that people preferred paying a large amount per server coupled with a small amount per client, rather than a moderate amount per client.</p>

		<p>A popular games console does a similar thing. Most games are peer-to-peer, yet you need to pay a monthly fee to the console manufacturer to enable that functionality.</p>
<p>Just highlighting Project Nosebleed is not the only product charging for &quot;server is the client is the server&quot; functionality.</p>

		<p>Funny, it turns out that servers are expensive for hosting content, leaderboards, servers for large games so one person doesn&#39;t have host advantage all that other good online multiplayer stuff. So the major competitor to said console is charging to enable that functionality too in the next version of their product!</p>
<p>Look, I agree Gold is overpriced, but the reliability of Xbox Live is tons better then PlayStation Network and it&#39;s not just about a P2P connection, it&#39;s about everything else too.</p>

		<p>At least Nosebleed Server added management tools. &nbsp;Client Access Licenses add zero functionality while adding license management headaches.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
