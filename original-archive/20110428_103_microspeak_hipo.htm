<p>A friend of mind was asked out of the blue, "What does <i>hypo</i> mean?"</p>
<p> She started to flash back to high school English class and Greek word roots. </p>
<p> "I've started to hear it everywhere. Like <i>Everyone in that meeting is a hypo</i> or <i>We need to reach out to hypos</i>." </p>
<p> My friend realized that she had mis-heard the question. It was not about the Greek root <i>hypo</i> but rather the bizarro Microspeak word <i>hipo</i>, shorthand for <i>high-potential employee</i>. </p>
<p> As I researched this term (which I had never encountered before), I found that it fell into that special category of Microspeak known as <i>if you have to ask, I'm not going to tell you</i>. Identifying and developing high-potential employees is one of the charter activities of the ExPo project. And if you look through the ExPo Web site, you'll find that nowhere do they tell you what <i>HiPo</i> and <i>ExPo</i> stand for. "If you have to ask, I'm not going to tell you." </p>
<p> My friend suggested that "ExPos are people who have a lot of potential and enjoy showing it off to others." </p>

		<p>The bonus irony is that &lt;i&gt;hypo&lt;/i&gt; in Greek actually means &quot;beneath&quot;, and in medical usage it refers to something which is below expected levels, e.g. &lt;i&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/i&gt; = lack of blood sugars.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t know &#8211; there are other options. It could be an &quot;abbreviation&quot; for &#39;Excellent Posers&#39;, or &#39;Expert Pontificators&#39; maybe. Or possibly &#39;Exceedingly Portentous&#39; even. Or maybe the self-fulfilling &#39;Extremely Postulate&#39;.</p>

		<p>My first association was the HIPO Corps, an auxiliary police corps during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, staffed with native collaborators and infamous for its brutality. Which makes &quot;Hipo&quot; a rather strong insult in Danish (and, after the war, a favorite chant of anti-establishment protesters facing perceived police oppression).</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve seen a similar (local-)Microspeak develop &#8211; in our project, someone (incorrectly) referred to a piece of code as &quot;business logic&quot;, shorted it to &quot;Bizzlo&quot;, and started using it throughout the specs. Fortunately, it didn&#39;t survive.</p>

		<p>Ah, the hipos. The 3rd sentence of Chapter i of <em>Moby Dick</em> is</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people&#39;s hats off &#8212; then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.&quot;</p>

		<p>ExPo stands for &#39;Exceptional Potential&#39;. Apparently &#39;Leaders Building Leaders&#39;, turning Tier 3 &#39;Individual Contributors&#39; (who need to &#39;[build] commitment and aspiration to leadership through greater self-awareness&#39; apparently) to get them into &#39;more senior, critical roles&#39;.</p>
<p>Sorry, if you&#39;re just an Individual Contributor, you&#39;re probably not critical and you&#39;re not self-aware I&#39;m afraid. If you&#39;re really fortunate (one of the lucky &#39;4%&#39;. Why 4%? Who knows!), a gracious ExPo might sweep out of leadership heaven and pluck you up and teach you self-awareness and how to be critical and important! How gracious of them.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have anything better to read and don&#39;t mind feeling nauseous, Microsoft espouse the benefits of this approach in:</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
