<p>Virtual memory is not virtual address space (part 1).</p>
<p>  I don't know where this myth comes from;  it's a <i>non sequitur</i>.  </p>
<p>  Virtual address space describes how addresses are resolved,  but since each process has its own virtual address space,  the amount consumed by one program has no effect on  that consumed by another program.  </p>
<p>  Say you have a program that allocates 1GB of memory.  Run three copies of it.  Now you have a total of  3GB of allocated memory.  And none of the programs came  even close to exhausting its 2GB virtual address space allotment.  </p>

		<p>As a side note, with a bit of work, you can use lots more than 2GB of memory per process without using /3GB: <a target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/memory/base/address_windowing_extensions.asp" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/memory/base/address_windowing_extensions.asp</a></p>
<p>This comes without the cost of throttling the kernel address space.</p>

		<p>&#8230;but with the cost of being a royal PIA. It&#8217;s basically doing your memory management manually, with the side effect of also removing some physical memory permanently from the OS&#8217;s control &#8211; it can&#8217;t swap memory reserved for AWE out, allocate it to another process or use it for the OS&#8217;s own purposes.</p>
<p>Also, only users (security principals) with the &#8216;Lock Pages In Memory&#8217; privilege (SE_LOCK_MEMORY_NAME) can call the AWE APIs. By default no principals have this right. SQL Server 2000&#8217;s setup program enables this right for the SQL Server service account. By contrast, the larger address space enabled by /3GB is available to all users.</p>
<p>SQL 2005 I think continues to support AWE on 32-bit x86 processors. The APIs are present but basically useless on 64-bit systems.</p>

		<p>One such confused site is LockerGnome.  Just goes to show that, as usual, you can only trust people that actually work in the field; not those that merely write about it :-)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with the lockergnome article except 1 skoppy use of a term (RAM) that everybody misuses anyway to mean any memory. I had to read it three times to find that anyway.</p>

		<p>Shared memory is not shared address space. A little experimentation with MapViewOfFile will demonstrate.</p>

		<p>Just picking a little nit about naming things&#8230;</p>
<p>Quote: &quot;Myth: Without /3GB the total amount of memory that can be allocated across all *programs* is 2GB&quot;. Shouldn&#8217;t that be &quot;&#8230; across all *processes* &#8230;&quot; ?</p>
<p>Though I haven&#8217;t used the feature myself in this form, the .NET framework supports running multiple &#8216;programs&#8217; within one single process, by running each of them in an AppDomain, isn&#8217;t it? I assume all of these &#8216;programs&#8217; share the same virtual address space, so the 2G or 3G limit applies to the bunch of them together. In other words, running three instances of a WebApp, each of which take 1Gbyte, will cause your webserver process to run out of memory, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Though not the most common use of the word &#8216;program&#8217; today, I can envision that soon you will need to clarify what you mean when using the word &#8216;program&#8217;; did you mean &#8216;process&#8217; or did you mean &#8216;application&#8217;.<br /></p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
