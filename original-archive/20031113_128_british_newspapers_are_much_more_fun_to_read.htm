<p>         You can always count on <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a> for         a snarky take on the day's technology news. Today's favorite is <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/33974.html">this         "review" of the nTAG</a>, which ends with      </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Well, we think that any sane person would have to held at gunpoint     to induce them to carry an electronic device which, besides containing personal or     other information which is transmitted wirelessly, can also be tracked by event organisers     and makes the wearer look like a complete muppet. We could be wrong, of course. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Even more mainstream papers like <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">The Guardian</a> can develop quite an attitude. They recently <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/mediaguardian/story/0,7558,1081296,00.html">ridiculed the furore over that thing that everybody is talking about but the courts have forbidden the press from reporting on</a>. My favorite is still this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4173226,00.html">list of things we don't miss</a>. I don't understand three quarters of it but I don't care; it's still a riot. </p>
<p> Why are newspapers in the States so stodgy? The only wild goofiness in a major paper I can think of offhand is the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/style/columns/styleinvitational/">Washington Post Style Invitational</a>, but they wouldn't dare let any of this infect their "serious" news... </p>

		<p>My english composition professor was a Brit and he would bring in the Guardian, it was only on paper then, so we could critique and analyze proper grammar. Since then I&#8217;ve tried to read it as regularly as possible.</p>

		<p>&quot;Must read&quot;-ing at our house is The Economist, a weekly newsmag that is the British equivalent of Time magazine &#8212; or would be, if Time were written intelligently, assumed an intelligent readership, and was positively brimming with British sarcasm.  If you&#8217;re a geek and like that kind of stuff, &quot;NTK&quot; is good, too.</p>

		<p>although I feel the leftie guardian (or the &#8216;grauniad&#8217; as it is sometimes known for it&#8217;s regular spelling mistakes: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;oe=UTF-8&#038;q=grauniad" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;oe=UTF-8&#038;q=grauniad</a> ) is of a better quality than practically all of the other sensationalising or partisan newspapers one finds in the united kingdom, it’s often satirical view of current affairs does have a disadvantage: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/~diffrentcolours/379526.html?mode=reply" rel="nofollow">http://www.livejournal.com/~diffrentcolours/379526.html?mode=reply</a>. i’m an indie man myself (<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.independent.co.uk/</a>).</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d like to note that what we&#8217;re talking about here is tabloid newspapers. Although tabloid refers to the shape of the paper, tabloid newspapers are almost always appalingly biased and full of crummy reporting.</p>
<p>The Register is every inch a tabloid :)</p>

		<p>The Inquirer is little better.</p>

		<p>The Guardian&#8217;s list might have been funny if it wasn&#8217;t for their complete dismissal of Swedish liquorice. Those Brits should get a hold of themselves.</p>

		<p>The Grauniad *isn&#8217;t* a tablod. The Indy is available in both formats physically (at least in some parts of the UK), but remains a &quot;broadsheet&quot; in character.</p>

		<p>If you think the Guardian is a tabloid you haven&#8217;t seen the British tabloids. While the Guardian does lean a bit politically (another thing to know about newspapers in Britain is that they have a quite clearly defined political point of view) at least they try to research their stories. </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
