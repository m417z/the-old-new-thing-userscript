<p>My friend the seventh-grade teacher is getting married this summer, and when her students learned about the impending nuptials, they couldn't contain their excitement.</p>
<p> The students asked her if there was going to be a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skylerbug/1460543129/"> chocolate fountain</a>. <a href="http://statesboroherald.ctwfeatures.com/brides/bridal_20070906_overkill.html"> Because you can't <i>not</i> have a chocolate fountain</a>. When they learned that, no, there will not be a chocolate fountain, the students lobbied hard for her to reconsider and please, you <i>have to have</i> a chocolate fountain. The concept of a fancy party without a chocolate fountain defied comprehension. I mean, isn't a chocolate fountain the <i>definition</i> of a fancy party? </p>
<p> Naturally, the students also wanted to be invited as guests. They are after all, the people the teacher spends the most time with, right? They shared so many experiences: They went on field trips together, they cheered when the school cross country team defeated its longtime rival, they were even there for the great Fire Drill of February '08. How could they possibly be left out? </p>
<p> The reasons for wanting to attend were different between the boys and the girls. The boys were basically in it so they could camp out by the chocolate fountain and nibble on sweets all day. The girls were drawn in by the opportunity to witness the pageantry of a wedding, the bride in a beautiful gown, the romance of exchanging vows with one's True Love. Oh, and then to camp out by the chocolate fountain and nibble on sweets all day. </p>

		<p>An in-law of mine married a woman, W, a few years ago. W&#8217;s mother(a real piece of work) did not contribute towards the wedding. Yet she insisted, violently, that there be a punch bowl fountain, and refused to attend if there was no fountain.</p>
<p>There was a fountain.</p>
<p>And to be extra parvenu, what type of chocolate is in the fountain ?</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  what type of chocolate is in the fountain ?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Google suggests: usually, a chocolate-flavoured &quot;coating syrup&quot; consisting of Vegetable oil, polyglycerol polyricinoleate, high fructose corn syrup, and, if you&#8217;re very lucky, a little cocoa powder&#8230;</p>

		<p>About the last paragraph: It starts way earlier than 7th grade. In my cousin&#8217;s wedding, one of the girls invited was so excited about the dress and the ceremony that she took the veil afterwards and wore it for the rest of the night. The girl was 4.</p>

		<p>C&#8217;mon, kids at a wedding are a blast. For one thing, they offset the crazy, uptight family (like the lady Nathan describes). If a wedding reception isn&#8217;t about multi-generational fun, what IS it about?</p>

		<p>Well&#8230;all I can say is if the cost of the wedding is per person (as most seem to be) 180 students can add up real quick. &nbsp;Not to mention having the added responsibility of supervising that many kids one ones own wedding day. &nbsp;Too much trouble, methinks.</p>

		<p>You put /what/ in a chocolate fountain? That sounds disgusting.</p>
<p>The only time I&#8217;ve used a chocolate fountain we followed the instructions, and used a tiny bit of vegetable oil and vast quantities of chocolate. Admittedly it was only Cadbury&#8217;s Dairy Milk rather than proper chocolate but it still sounds a lot nicer than all that syrup stuff mentioned here.</p>

		<p>Well, the teacher is the bride that the 7th graders have spent the most time with. They may have been taken when very small to the weddings of the younger of their parents&#8217; generation, and when somewhat older to weddings of parents&#8217; younger co-workers. But in no case would it be somebody they&#8217;d spent 150 hours with over eight or nine months.</p>

		<p>I dunno what you guys in the states get in your chocolate fountains, but over here in the UK we have a specially blended belgian chocolate which contains no vegetable oil for smoothness &#8211; it&#8217;s done using cocoa butter. &nbsp;Something like this, although there are a few different manufacturers.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.gilesandposner.com/chocolate.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gilesandposner.com/chocolate.htm</a></p>
<p>I think most chocolate in the states contains vegetable oil anyway because it&#8217;s a lot cheaper.</p>

		<p>Mr. Chen,</p>
<p>You probably don&#8217;t hear this much any more, but I&#8217;m trying to track down the complete Romana &#8216;n Dave series. &nbsp;The most promising lead I&#8217;ve found is a Usenet post you made in 1991 (which should tell you something about how well my search is going).</p>
<p>Do you still have the series? &nbsp;If so, can you send me the files? &nbsp;If not, do you have any suggestions on who I should ask?</p>
<p>My email is sailorptah at yahoo dot com. &nbsp;Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
