A customer asked for clarification on what they
considered an enigmatic sentence in
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms684315(v=vs.85).aspx">
the documentation for
the <code>Open&shy;Mutex</code> function</a>:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
If your multithreaded application must repeatedly create,
open, and close a named mutex object, a race condition can occur.
In this situation, it is better to use
<b>Create&shy;Mutex</b>
instead of
<b>Open&shy;Mutex</b>,
because
<b>Create&shy;Mutex</b>
opens a mutex if it exists and creates it if it does not.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
"What is this race condition the documentation is talking about?
Our program uses <code>Open&shy;Mutex</code> and we are wondering
if we should switch to <code>Create&shy;Mutex</code>."
</p>
<p>
Consider two threads. One thread calls
<code>Create&shy;Mutex</code>,
then
<code>Close&shy;Handle</code>,
then
<code>Create&shy;Mutex</code>,
then
<code>Close&shy;Handle</code>,
then
<code>Create&shy;Mutex</code>,
then
<code>Close&shy;Handle</code>,
and so on.
</p>
<p>
The other thread calls <code>Open&shy;Mutex</code>.
</p>
<p>
The race condition is that the second thread's call to <code>Open&shy;Mutex</code>
will fail if it takes place after the first thread calls
<code>Close&shy;Handle</code> and before it gets to make its next
call to <code>Create&shy;Mutex</code>.
</p>
<p>
One of my colleagues couldn't understand why MSDN bothers to say
anything about this situation at all.
"You can't open a mutex that doesn't exist.
Duh.
I think this adds more confusion than it helps."
</p>
<p>
I suspect the reason why MSDN bothers to say anything about this is that
there was a customer who had two threads.
One thread calls
<code>Create&shy;Mutex</code>,
then
<code>Close&shy;Handle</code>,
then
<code>Create&shy;Mutex</code>,
then
<code>Close&shy;Handle</code>,
then
<code>Create&shy;Mutex</code>,
then
<code>Close&shy;Handle</code>,
and so on.
The other thread calls <code>Open&shy;Mutex</code>.
</p>
<p>
This customer found that if the second thread calls
<code>Open&shy;Mutex</code> at an inopportune time,
the call fails.
They then insisted that something be added to the documentation
to
<a HREF="https://technet.microsoft.com/magazine/jj643252.aspx">
state explicitly that a bad idea is a bad idea</a>.
Probably because they needed something in writing to show
their management in order to justify the time they are going to
need to spend fixing the bug.
</p>
<p>
Once again, MSDN has been forced into
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160519-00/?p=93495">
being a pawn in some company's internal politics</a>.</p>

		<p>If the customer/manager is the type of person who trust a stranger third party over the person they have employed to do the work, then there is no hope of explaining anything to them.</p>
<p>The only thing you can blame the people further down the line for is continuing to work there.</p>

		<p>It reminds me of the times I have had to argue with clients or partners about their implementation of a specification that were were all supposed to adhere to. These scenarios were all too common:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do A, then B, then C&#8221; -&gt; It doesn&#8217;t explicitly say you CAN&#8217;T do A, X, Y, Z, then B and C&#8221;<br />
&#8220;RFU&#8221; -&gt; Used for some proprietary value<br />
&#8220;Can be either A or B&#8221; -&gt; Competitor uses A, so we&#8217;re going to use B!<br />
&#8220;Can be either A or B&#8221; -&gt; Competitor uses A, different competitor uses B so we&#8217;re going to do A when we feel like it and B when we feel like it, but you must be clairvoyant to know when and where<br />
&#8220;Optional&#8221; -&gt; Mandatory<br />

		<p>&gt; Have I mentioned already how I hate those if not I really really hate those issues that are there because the people further down the line are incapable of explaining how things work to their customer/manager</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s not even about whether those does the line are capable of explaining it or not, it&#8217;s just the upper management won&#8217;t hear, thus need documentation from technology vendor to support the need to fix a bug (that may not be reproduciable by QA)</p>
<p>To them, a bug not reported is not a bug that exist, unless there are other source say there is really a potential bug there.</p>

		<p>If you handle a mutex in a way that requires a mutex to regulate the mutex, it will require an additional mutex to regulate the mutex.<br />
It&#8217;s turtles all the way down.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
