		<p>You&#39;ve posted before about recreational cycling, so I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t tie that in, because there is a specific meaning in cycling (related to the military meaning, the count of footfalls in a unit of time in a march, incidentally giving us the 1990 Charlie Sheen movie, &quot;Cadence&quot;; it seems to be Charlie Sheen week here!): the cadence is the number of pedal revolutions per minute. &nbsp;A typical rider should target a minimum cadence of 70; less than 70, you are in too high a gear, you are going to tire out and hurt your knees. &nbsp;Lance Armstrong will hold a cadence of 100-120 for hours. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Actually, cadence is a term borrowed from music. There it refers to the ending of a musical &quot;thought&quot; (sometimes called &quot;foot&quot;, but that presents far greater issues in the field). Given the phrase, &quot;What was the cadence of email requests you sent out to drive contributions?&quot;, I would look at you like your third head just sprouted a tumor. Either that, or I would say, &quot;I was expecting it to be a PAC, but it turned out to be deceptive.&quot;</p>

		<p>Also, a cadence is a place in a piece of music that feels like a stopping or resting point.</p>
<p>So in this sense &#39;timeline&#39; meaning seems ok to me.</p>

		<p>I worked in an office where they said &quot;out of pocket&quot; instead of &quot;out of the office&quot;. &nbsp;They also used &quot;buggin&#39; out&quot; to mean going home. &nbsp;Example: &nbsp;I&#39;m buggin&#39; out at 3 and will be out of pocket tomorrow.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve recently thought of &quot;cadence&quot; as the rhythm we adopt when we get really immersed in some sort of activity &#8211; kind of like getting into a groove.</p>
<p>Then again, I&#39;m probably biased, as I run <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://cadence.cc" rel="nofollow">http://cadence.cc</a>&#8230;</p>

		<p>I agree with Alex Grigoriev. I hate trying to decipher a secret &quot;inside&quot; language. Why can&#39;t everyone just try to communicate clearly? Are these just a select few individuals, or do the majority of Microsoft employees use &quot;Microspeak&quot;?</p>

		<p>Some of us actually work against MicroSpeak. For example, I will never accept an &quot;ask&quot; from a team member. I&#39;ll get them them to tell me whether it&#39;s a request, a demand, a need, or something else that actually has contextual meaning. But that&#39;s not something I&#39;d do outside with folks outside my team, since that&#39;s a sure way to not get what you want from them.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure why there is a predisposition to MicroSpeak, but I sorely wish I knew how to stop it. Unfortunately, I&#39;d say I&#39;m in the minority. It may be a large minority, but a minority nonetheless.</p>

		<p>As a visitor to Msft&#39;s campus with a semi-regular cadence of ~9 months, it does seem that most Msfties speak Microspeak with varying degrees of fluency. &nbsp;I think it just slips in. &nbsp;I also wonder from time to time if marketing encourages this implicitly or explicitly. &nbsp;Hearing the verb/nown &#39;bing&#39; being used in obvious replacement of &#39;google&#39; in quasi-casual conversation just had a dull ring to it.</p>

		<p>I have to actively combat it at our company, because we work with Microsoft a lot. (&quot;ask&quot; makes me wince.)</p>
<p>We actually do use &quot;cadence&quot; though, in Raymond&#39;s first meaning. Fortunately, I haven&#39;t seen either of the last two examples yet, although I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll see them sooner or later.</p>
<p>I used to think Microspeak was a variation on people using long words (usually incorrectly) to appear smarter than they actually are. Now I&#39;m not so sure&#8230; mostly because a lot of Microspeak words are very short.</p>
<p>The weird thing is that Microsoft doesn&#39;t seem to use as much technical lingo as much engineering companies do, but instead they create lingo for the normal everyday business stuff.</p>

		<p>Joe, you&#39;re right that cadence is used to refer to the beat, but not *only* the beat. The word originally meant (and still means) a distinctive pattern at the end of a phrase. Interestingly enough, the word comes from cadenza, a typically non-rhythmic passage at the end of a musical piece.</p>

		<p>@Joe Cadence in music means the beat and only the beat. Perhaps some here are thinking of Coda, which does means the concluding passage.</p>
<p>Cadence in music can also mean the resolution of a harmonic tension (this is the way I&#39;ve heard it used most frequently). &nbsp;If I play a diminished fifth (F-B, say, with an implicit or explicit G7/G9/Dm6 chord), and thene resolve to a perfect third (C-E, in this case) that&#39;s an authentic cadence (over I-IV-V or I-IV-ii in C) &#8211; with the dominant chord resolving to the tonic, and the harmonic tension resolving neatly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s curious that in all cultures language becomes hijacked for purposes other than communicating. It&#39;s unfortunate that the culture surrounding English seems to stress being &#39;flexible&#39; in our language. Flexibility in language is a guaranteed way to ensure failed communication. I think the premise that &#39;common usage&#39; represents a word in a language is erroneous. The minimum criteria should be a word that is universally understood by anyone fluent in the language. This precludes words that apply to cliquey business usages &#8211; usually derived by idiots for idiots.</p>

		<p>@Joe:</p>
<p>Adding to GWO, coda also doesn&#39;t mean what you think it means.</p>
<p>Coda is a conclusion of the whole movement, and it&#39;s not just a &quot;passage&quot;, but can be quite elaborate.</p>

		<p>Cadence is not beat. A rythmic cadence indicates the end of a pattern; this is the cause that people mistakes this for &quot;beat.&quot; I don&#39;t think the other meaning (tonal cadence) is the cause of it, thought since it also marks the resolution of a progression (which also has beat) people may also confound it as &quot;rythm&quot;.</p>
<p>Anyways, I think this Microspeak bit is so unnerving that I had to post a comment.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
