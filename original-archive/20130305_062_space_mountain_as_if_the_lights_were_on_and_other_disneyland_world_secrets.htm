<p>Many years ago, some friends of mine went to Disneyland and got to experience Space Mountain in an unusual way.</p>
<p> They went through the ride the normal way, but when the car returned to the load/unload area, the <a href="http://www.talesofadisneylandcm.com/"> cast member</a> (because that's what Disney calls them) asked, "Do you want to go again?" </p>
<p> Everybody in the car enthusiastically shouted, "Yes!" </p>
<p> (Presumably they were falling behind on the loading and unloading, and waving a car through saved them a bit of time they could use to catch up.) </p>
<p> The second time through the ride was qualitatively different: Their eyes had already acclimated to the dark, so even though they were going through the ride like everybody else, they could see the room as if the lights were on. </p>
<p> There are a number of videos of Disneyworld Space Mountain with the lights on, <a href="http://thedisneyblog.com/2012/05/02/space-mountain-lights-on-via-the-peoplemover/"> captured from the PeopleMover</a>, but that's not the same as <i>riding it</i> with the lights on. </p>

		<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that either Disney Land Paris or Disney World Florida have run Space Mountain with the lights on (it&#39;s one or the other as I&#39;ve only been to those two).</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve been through space mountain at Disneyworld with the lights on. &nbsp;I thought it was creepier than with the lights off.</p>
<p>We&#39;d been waiting in line for like 40 minutes when the ride broke down. &nbsp;Cast members went through the line telling everyone, but said, &quot;we don&#39;t know how long it will be down, could be 10 minutes, could be hours. &nbsp;you can stay in line if you want&quot; &nbsp;So my family decided to stay in line for 15 more minutes, and then bail. &nbsp;Almost everyone vacated the line, so we were in the first car 10 minutes later when they&#39;d fixed the ride. They wanted to run it once with the lights on just in case, so we got to see it with the lights on. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In one way, it wasn&#39;t as scary, because you could see things coming. &nbsp;But in another way, it was as scary, because you could see how close you got to other parts of the track, which you couldn&#39;t see in the dark!</p>
<p>after the ride with the lights on, they turned them off and we got to go 2 more times before they re-opened the ride and let others back on. &nbsp;It was a long wait, but not longer than super busy days, and we got to ride 3 straight times, so that was cool.</p>

		<p>I have no idea what sort of ride that is but presumably you could get a similar effect by closing your eyes tight as soon as you&#39;re &quot;seated&quot; and then opening them when you enter the dark area, no?</p>

		<p>@JustSomeGuy it&#39;s a pretty standard roller coaster, but entirely contained (except for the loading/unlodaing area) within a large dark (nearly black) room (with projections of stars and galaxies on the walls). The loading area is very well-lit, so you&#39;d need to be more aggressive than simply using your eyelids to get sufficient dark-acclimation.</p>
<p>As an extra measure to augment the darkness, the incline up which the car goes before the &quot;real part of the ride&quot; happens is in a brightly-lit tunnel with a light at the end shining straight at the riders. Without taking special measures, it&#39;s very much designed to make sure the riders&#39; night vision is obliterated before they enter the dark room.</p>

		<p>I think it was Disneyland Paris which had Space Mountain with lights on, I don&#39;t know if it was time limited but it was advertised like that. Not just due to maintenance. It wasn&#39;t full lights on, but you could see. They probably got complaints because of the dark.</p>
<p>I never liked space mountain, big thunder mountain and splash mountain is better.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
