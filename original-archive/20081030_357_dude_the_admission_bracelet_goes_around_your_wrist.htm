<p> Short stories from the 2008 PDC: </p>
<ul>
<li>On the bus heading to the attendee party at Universal Studios,     I overhear one person advising another on how to put on the     band that grants admission to the park:     "Be careful not to catch any hair on the glue.     Otherwise it's a real pain in the butt."     Dude, I don't know where <i>you</i> put it,     but the admission bracelet goes around your wrist. </li>
<li>The Windows&nbsp;7 networking folks are     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2008/10/29/come-see-windows-7-directaccess-and-branchcache-pdc08-pavillion.aspx">     showing off two new features: DirectAccess and BranchCache</a>.     I've seen them and even though they're not flashy     (I mean, how flashy can you make networking?),     they're wicked cool features for corporations. </li>
<li>It's great talking with people and discovering all the great     things they've been doing,     how they've put together the various pieces with clever     bits of glue to do something amazing.     I can only imagine that the inventor of LEGO feels this way. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b> added 9am: </p>
<ul>
<li>On same evening as the Ask the Experts session was     a Lakers-Clippers basketball game in the Staples Center     arena next door to the convention center.     I overheard some of the event staff organizers discussing     where they can legally set up their security perimeter     to prevent rowdy basketball fans from entering the     convention center and drinking the free alcohol.     Apparently, parts of the convention center are     classified as public space. </li>
<li>On the last day of the conference, one of the parking     garages is converted into a giant suitcase storage room.     Peering into it recalls the final scene     of <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>. </li>
<li>     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/girishr/">Girish Raja</a>     is in charge of wireless connectivity at the 2008 PDC.     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/girishr/archive/2008/10/27/wireless-at-pdc-2008.aspx">     The keynote room was the biggest puzzle</a>.     Back in 2005, you only had to worry about people     getting wireless connectivity     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmazner/archive/2005/03/28/403090.aspx">     once they stepped out of the keynote room</a>,     but now, you have hordes of people     who need internet connectivity <i>during the keynote</i>.     I'm looking forward to seeing further entries discussing the logistics     of providing that much wireless bandwidth for a conference     like the PDC. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.sriramkrishnan.com/blog/">Sriram Krishnan</a>     had a tough sell: He had to convince people to come to his talk     <a href="http://www.sriramkrishnan.com/blog/2008/10/my-windows-azure-talk-or-how-i-need-to.html">     even though it took place at the same time as mine and Anders's</a>.     (Though from looking at the attendee feedback, it looks like he     did just fine.     In fact, he did <i>better than me</i>.)     I was chatting with him afterwards,     and he noted that the keynote demos for cloud computing were a     nail-biter because, well, it's the cloud.     <i>Anything can happen&mdash;it's the cloud</i>. </li>
<li>Last week,     I mentioned in mixed company (which to technology nerds     means not men and women but rather geeks and non-geeks)     that I couldn't join them for an event they were planning     because I was going to be at the PDC.     One of the non-geeks asked, "What is PDC?"     My reply: "Pretty Dorky Conference." </li>

		<p>For those of us who have a lot of armhair, those wristbands are very irritating if they get stuck to the armhairs. &nbsp;Putting one one requires a couple extra seconds to make sure the sticky part is lined up so there&#8217;s no exposed glue.</p>

		<p>MrMister, I think the joke was that the guy said it would be a &quot;pain in the butt&quot;, implying perhaps that he had applied the bracelet to his butt rather than his wrist.</p>

<p>Going by the name, I would expect DirectAccess to be part of DirectX but from the short description I gather it isn&#8217;t?</p>

		<p>Pi: Was it really that hard to click the link?</p>
<p>I clicked the link and read a little about DirectAccess &#8212; it appears to be a VPN-like technology that is always active, routing and encrypting packets headed for the corporate network using IPSec and eliminating the need to connect or disconnect from the VPN.</p>

		<p>The P2P version of BranchCache sounds like it&#8217;d be worth running even on a small home network. Assuming I understood correctly and it would transparently cache common downloads, e.g. Windows Update files, without much setup overhead.</p>

		<p>jcs:</p>
<p>When I said &quot;short description&quot; I meant the one you get after clicking the link. The question mark translates to &quot;is it really a good idea then to name it &#8216;DirectAccess&#8217;?&quot;</p>
<p>I understand if it was a little bit vague.</p>

		<p>Furious clicking while you play the latest Flash time-waster game is just as annoying as snoring (which is almost just as annoying as a speaker you wanted to see drolling on, not noticing he&#8217;s lost his audience.)</p>

		<p>Connectivity at PDC was spotty at times, but considering the sheer volume of geeks with WiFi devices, I think they did remarkably well.</p>
<p>Connectivity at the Wilshire Grand Hotel, on the other hand, was just abysmal. &nbsp;Maybe for PDC09 some LA hotel should pull in a gigabit fiber line and charge extra for it. &nbsp;They&#8217;d sell out.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
