<p>A customer asked, "I have a listview control in report view with the <code>LVS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>CHECK&shy;BOXES</wbr></wbr></code> extended style. I noticed that unchecked checkboxes are not visible until I hover over the corresponding item. Is it possible to get the checkboxes to be visible all the time?"</p>
<p> I was kind of puzzled by this question because the default behavior of the list view control is to show the checkboxes all the time. I could have sat down and written a test program to prove it, but that would have taken too much time, and it wouldn't have advanced the story any. (The customer would merely have written back, "Well, that's not what I'm seeing.") </p>
<p> This appeared to be a case of a customer providing incomplete information, forcing me to invoke my psychic powers to fill them in. </p>
<p> "My psychic powers tell me that you have also set the <code>LVS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>AUTO&shy;CHECK&shy;SELECT</wbr></wbr></code> extended style. When <code>LVS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>AUTO&shy;CHECK&shy;SELECT</wbr></wbr></code> is set, then unchecked checkboxes are hidden." </p>
<p> Remember, when you ask a question about a component and you have done any customization to that component, please remember to mention that when you ask your question. Otherwise nobody will be able to reproduce your problem, because they will assume you left everything at the defaults. </p>
<p> It's like calling the Ikea customer service line, saying "My Ikea <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/29/64390.aspx"> Frustr&auml;t</a> rolling cabinet doesn't roll properly on my hardwood floor when I put more than about 25 pounds of stuff on it." The person on the phone looks up the specifications for the rolling cabinet and sees that that is well within the design limits. "I paid for you guys to assemble and install it, so it can't be an assembly or installation error." The person on the other end scratches their head for a while. And then you mention, "Oh, but I didn't like the color of the wheels, so I replaced them with some other wheels I bought at Home Depot." </p>
<p> Oh, yeah, thanks for not mentioning that. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yeah, thanks for not mentioning that.&quot;</p>
<p>You see, the problem is that they changed a lot of things in addition to the style. If you already know what &quot;the component&quot; is, or if you only changed one thing, you can probably guess that&#39;s where the problem comes from. But if you have built a complex system out of many interacting parts you don&#39;t fully understand, and something is not doing exactly what you want it too, you only have three options: 1. Keep changing stuff until you can figure it out, 2. Spend time learning exactly how these parts work, or 3. Pay someone who understands how they work so they can help you.</p>
<p>It is like calling the Ikea customer service line because your rolling cabinet doesn&#39;t roll properly, except that cabinet has 76 pairs of wheels, was assembled and heavily customized 12 years ago by some other division you&#39;ve never seen, and you actually have no idea that wheels can affect rolling.</p>

		<p>For the longest time we had the saying at our work &quot;Documentation always wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>We got it when our own engineers would consult the documentation rather than the code when customers asked us questions and gave them wrong answers.</p>
<p>We finally got rid of it by purging almost all the documentation and starting over again.</p>

		<p>The problem with complaining that they with-held relevant information is that they had no way of knowing that the information they &quot;with-held&quot; was not relevant, so it wasn&#39;t really their fault.</p>
<p>What if the relevant information had been that this was a bug that was fixed in a Windows Update that they hadn&#39;t applied but simply didn&#39;t know contained the fix ? &nbsp;Should they have also included a manifest of all Windows Updates that had been applied to the machine, just in case ? &nbsp;Maybe there was some third party software that was (I don&#39;t know how) interfering with the behaviour of the control. &nbsp;Should they have also provided a complete list of all installed software (and not &quot;installed&quot; but merely present software), just in case ? &nbsp;Maybe &#8211; and this is highly unlikely I know &#8211; but it could have been some errant corruption of a binary (or binaries), so a complete set of checksums as well, just in case ?</p>
<p>The only thing that makes this NOT a &quot;read the documentation&quot; issue is the fact that the documentation itself WITH-HOLDS RELEVANT INFORMATION.</p>
<p>So yes, it is an issue of relevant information being with-held, but the originator of that problem was NOT the customer.</p>

		<p>Btw, if the bahaviour isn&#39;t documented in MSDN, how could the customer know it&#39;s relevent? It&#39;s common practice to strip down the code to include only relevent part when sending the source to outside. It seems reasonable for me that the customer may just think LVS_EX_AUTOÂ­CHECKÂ­SELECT is irrelevent detail and exclude it from the scene, because there isn&#39;t any reason to think an auto-check option would make the boxes disappear.</p>

		<p>@Mark: &nbsp;The comment wasn&#39;t there at the time I made the post.</p>

		<p>@Everybody saying the customer could not have known the information was relevant:</p>
<p>lvs_ex_autoCHECKselect would seem to me to have something to do with CHECKboxes. Therefore, if you have a problem with CHECKboxes, this something to do with CHECKboxes is highly likely to be relevant to your problem with the CHECKboxes.</p>

		<p>@Drak: Have you ever been in the position to cleanup the source code to ask for help? The process involves removing everything your mind judge as &quot;irrelevent&quot;. Anything matches that filter will be removed, that&#39;s it. Having the word &quot;CHECK&quot; in it won&#39;t make it special to make it state, otherwise people would have left the original default selections in the sample source code too, which in the real life, is rarely left there.</p>

		<p>&quot;I&#39;m having an issue with the LVS_EX_CHECKBOXES extended list view style. Here&#39;s all the styles I&#39;m using on my list view: [list].&quot;</p>
<p>Seems like the way to do it to me.</p>
<p>Although stripping it down to the minimal components to make sure that reproduces the issue seems like a good idea. If your stripped down version doesn&#39;t reproduce and you can&#39;t figure out why, then you can ask what components might override the behavior. Then you&#39;re no longer withholding information, but asking for it.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
