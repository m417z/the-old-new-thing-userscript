<p> The verb phrase <i>touch base</i> is <a href="http://businessguysonbusinesstrips.com/?page_id=173"> in general business jargon use</a>, but it's quite popular at Microsoft. </p>
<p> To <i>touch base</i> with someone is to contact someone in a lightweight and mostly-informal sort of way. In other words, it takes the form of a piece of email or a brief office visit rather than a formal meeting with an agenda. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Bob, can you touch base with the Nosebleed team to verify that this design change won't affect them? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Bob is expected to contact a representative from the Nosebleed team, either by sending email, or by telephone, or by stopping by their office for a quick chat. If Bob sets up a one-hour meeting with a dozen engineers from both sides, then he's blowing the issue out of proportion. </p>

		<p>People have been saying that even here in South Africa for as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>But now that you&#39;ve mentioned it, it makes no sense in a SA or even English speaking context. Sounds American, like something that originated in baseball? We don&#39;t even play baseball here.</p>

		<p>Microspeak: &quot;Automobile&quot;</p>
<p>At Microsoft, the word &quot;Automobile&quot; is used to describe a form of motorised personal transport, usually with four wheels and a gasoline or electric engine. &nbsp;They&#39;re widely used on campus at Redmond &#8212; mostly by employees to travel to and from their homes &#8212; to the extent that large expanses space are set aside for the &quot;parking&quot; of &quot;automobiles&quot; (&quot;Parking&quot; is Microspeak for the process of abandoning one&#39;s &quot;automobile&quot; in order to perform some function away from it). &nbsp;At my trip to Microsoft UK, I discovered that &quot;automobiles&quot; are sometimes refered to as &quot;cars&quot;, and these areas for &quot;parking&quot; are called &quot;car parks&quot;.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>The word &quot;automobile&quot; is not used at Microsoft significantly more frequently than in the general population, so mastery of the term does not &quot;mark&quot; you as a Microsoftie. -Raymond</em>]</div>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
