Today's Little Program isn't even a program.
It demonstrates how to register a shell context menu
command that applies only to files with a specific name.
</p>
<p>
Let's say that you want a special context menu command,
let's call it
<i>Party!</i>,
on any file called
<code>party.txt</code>.
If invoked, it runs CharMap
because everybody knows that CharMap is a total party animal.
</p>
<p>
Now, if you wanted the command to apply to any text file,
you would use the following registration:
</p>
<pre>
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\Party!\command]
@="charmap.exe"
</pre>
<p>
But this offers the <i>Party!</i> command
on humorless files like <code>readme.txt</code>.
</p>
<p>
Fixing this is a special case of
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/02/07/10391707.aspx">
getting dynamic behavior for static verbs by using Advanced
Query Syntax</a>.
In this case, we create an Advanced Query Syntax filter that
selects an exact file name.
</p>
<pre>
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.txt\shell\Party!]
"AppliesTo"="System.FileName:=Party.txt"
</pre>

		<p>Oh good.  I was afraid I&#8217;d have to run through my entire backlog of Stack Overflow answers and fix all the links to your blog.</p>
<p>(Yes, I know that your blog is for entertainment purposes only.  No, I don&#8217;t care, because entries like your &#8220;finalizers are evil and cannot be relied upon&#8221; post are simply too useful not to link.)</p>

<p>Also, do you mean to use two different registry paths in the example above? (&#8230;\txtfile\&#8230; and &#8230;\.txt\&#8230;)</p>

		<p>Since it is known the target file is a .txt, there&#8217;s no point in making this registration against the entire class of text files (which includes other extensions). If the filter were to apply to any text file that started with Party, then it would be appropriate to use the larger class.</p>

		<p>Sure&#8230;. but then shouldn&#8217;t the [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\Party!\command] @=&#8221;charmap.exe&#8221; also be on the .txt node?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand why you would add the context handler command on the txtfile node but the &#8220;Applies To&#8221; qualifier on the the .txt node.</p>
<p>I would think they should both be on the .txt node, unless there is something I am missing.</p>

		<p>Seems like using advanced query syntax could significantly impact performance, especially using conditions like file size or exclusion criteria (from your link)&#8230; and even more-so if the data source is remote / offline (and in this case, would the recall operation be UI blocking for the context menu?)</p>

		<p>AQS may be slower than a strcmp in a custom handler, but the cost of loading the custom handler is far greater than executing an AQS expression.</p>

		<p>so in the case of remote files, where the file contents provide clues about the file type (infopath being the first example which comes to mind, since it&#8217;s just a .xml, but IE knows that it&#8217;s infopath, which I suspect is due to the XML directives in the contents), wouldn&#8217;t the performance be a huge issue, or are special tricks employed (perhaps indicating that parts of the file need to be kept in the local file stub, to be accessible to the shell extension)?</p>

		<p>It&#8217;d be extremely nice if this could be used to clean up some of those extensions that hog up or even hang up Explorer just to put an icon on the desktop&#8217;s context menu.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Today’s Little Program isn’t even a program.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Strictly speaking, I think that string &#8220;AppliesTo&#8221;=&#8221;System.FileName:=Party.txt&#8221; meets the criteria of a program!  It is formatted to meet certain rules; it specifies an algorithm; it is interpreted by &#8230; something deep in Windows&#8217; code.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
