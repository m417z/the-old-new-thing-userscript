<p> Today is Election Day in the United States. Some years ago, seventh grade students (age&nbsp;12) were asked to imagine they had just been elected president and to give an address to the nation on one thing they would change. </p>
<p> Remember, these are only the most entertaining ideas. Do not assume all student ideas are like these. </p>
<ul>
<li>Ban "all types of non-purpose car racing." </li>
<li>Defend against zombie attack. </li>
<li>Withdraw from Iraq and use the money to fund electric cars and ban smoking. </li>
<li>Repeal all taxes. </li>
<li>Name Arnold Schwarzenegger as Vice President. </li>
<li>Shorten all school days to increase learning. </li>
<li>Build a holographic wall at the border.     For the immigrants who don't fall for it and run right through,     station border patrol just behind it. </li>
<li>Shut down all cigarette factories.     "If you somehow manage to get cigarettes, we don't care." </li>
<li>Make     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/11/26/9928892.aspx">     chocolate milk</a> the official drink. </li>
</ul>
<p> And this sentence came from a student destined for greatness as a politician: "Something must be done, and I will make it happen." </p>

		<p>What exactly is funny in &quot;Withdraw from Iraq and use the money to fund electric cars and ban smoking.&quot; except for the fact that it would actually be a good plan (except for the tobacco industry and thus doomed to failure because of lobbies) ? It&#39;s unrealistic, but if you are not idealistic at 12, you will never be.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut down all cigarette factories. &quot;If you somehow manage to get cigarettes, we don&#39;t care.&quot; &gt;&gt; Nederlands stance for light drugs, and most country stance for prostitution is not very different. In Italy for example, brothels are prohibited, prostitution not.</p>

		<p>The holographic border wall idea is really thinking outside the box!</p>
<p>(The box where it&#39;s cheaper and more effective to built a normal wall. :-D)</p>
<p>It would be great for watching movies on, no doubt.</p>

		<p>Shorten all school days to increase learning &#8211; I think there may be evidence on this.</p>
<p>If the school day is too long then this may be counterproductive due to fatigue etc.</p>
<p>How much do people really remember of this last lesson of the day?</p>
<p>It&#39;s much like how much work do you do ( and not have to redo) in the last half an hour in the office.</p>

		<p>People would scoff at the &#39;prepare for zombie onslaught&#39; idea, but I honestly think it has some merit. Maybe not necessarily because there&#39;s the potential for a roving horde of zombies, but because the kinds of things you&#39;d do in a case like that are actually valuable preparedness ideas in general.</p>
<p>Be aware of your surroundings, have a stock of non perishable food, know the quickest escape routes, have a communication plan, be familiar with how to barricade your home, know what you absolutely needed to grab (medication, identification, money, etc.) in the event you needed to leave the house in a hurry, etc.</p>
<p>I think the emergency planning groups out there are missing out on not using that kind of thinking to get people to think about things. After all, &quot;Emergency Preparedness&quot; is boring, but &quot;Don&#39;t get eaten by zombies!&quot; is fun.</p>

		<p>Re: Arnold Schwarzenegger as Vice President</p>
<p>Could you actually do that? I know he&#39;s not eligible to run for the office of the president, but what about VP?</p>
<p>Or what if he followed in the footsteps of Ford, ie. the VP resigned and he was first nominated for VP (outside the electoral process) and then to presidency?</p>

<p>While there are many positions in the presidential line of succession that can be held by citizens not born in this country, succession would necessarily skip them because of 3 USC 19(e) (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/3/19.html#e" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.cornell.edu/&#8230;/19.html</a>).</p>

<p>No. Although you can, like Gerald Ford, become Vice-President and then President without being elected to either office, the rules for eligibility for the office of Vice-President are the same as those for President. Amendment XII to the United States Constitution states, in part, that &quot;no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle is correct that succession skips those who are not eligible to be President, but such a person could not be Vice-President anyway.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
