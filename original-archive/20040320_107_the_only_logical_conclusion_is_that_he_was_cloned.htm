<p>Something is wrong with the world when <a href="http://www.fark.com/">fark</a>&nbsp;finds something&nbsp;"real" news organizations miss. (When I first learned about fark, I confused it with <a href="http://www.farcep.org/">FARC</a>, a different organization entirely. That's right, a terrorist organization has its own official web site. Gotta love the Internet.)</p>
<p>Anyway, fark has pointed out that the guy that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/international/AP-Al-Qaida-Hunt.html">Pakistani forces claim today to have surrounded along the border with Afghanistan</a>, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,651986,00.html">already reported to have been captured two years ago</a> by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Grauniad</a>. They never printed a correction (as far as I can tell) so I guess he cloned himself.</p>

		<p>That would be The Guardian newspaper in Britian.  They are notoriously bad spellers, hence the affectionate nickname.</p>

		<p>The Guardian only reported that an Iranian newspaper said he had been captured; it didn&#8217;t report the capture as fact. If the Iranian report was wrong, that wouldn&#8217;t make the Guardian report wrong and in need of correction.</p>

		<p>Hmm, sounds like that could be used for liable reporting by proxy.  &quot;Hey, I didn&#8217;t say you liked to run around in a ladies dress and a football helmet, I was just reporting that someone else said that.&quot;</p>

		<p>If you read the article it says that the Iranian government denied that they had him.</p>
<p>Maybe they had him and let him go?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
