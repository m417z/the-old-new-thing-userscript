<p>If you come to New York City in December, you'll find the festive Christmas season throughout the town. Skaters wobble beneath the giant tree in Rockefeller Center. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rustinpc/2087040603/"> Giant snowflakes adorn the upper floors of the Saks Fifth Avenue store</a> while animated Christmas-themed window displays entertain visitors on the ground floor of Saks, as well as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kuniochi/2085761130/"> Macy's</a> (where Santa takes a roller coaster ride), <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/2066263204/"> Lord and Taylor</a>, and many other stores.</p>
<p> But somewhat overlooked in all this extravagance are the amateur efforts of the residents of Dyker Heights. (Take the&nbsp;R to 86th then make the 20-minute walk or catch the B64 bus to 11th Avenue.) There is no line for tickets; there is no entrance. You just wander through the streets admiring the Christmas lights, inflatable snowmen, Nativity displays, and other decorations, be they tasteful and reverential or (what you're more likely to notice) ostentatious and mind-boggling. </p>
<p> There were a lot of extravagant displays, but the one that took the cake was the large house with a 15-foot-tall Santa flanked by 20-foot tall nutcracker soldiers, accompanied by two merry-go-rounds and life-size figures waving to passers-by from the upper balcony. </p>
<p> Visit in the early evening, say from 5pm to 7pm. This hits the sweet spot between "late enough that night has fallen" and "catch them before the lights are turned off." We visited during a weekday and there were barely any people on the streets, and those we saw were locals just out for an evening stroll. There were a few cars driving slowly through the neighborhood, but not enough to disrupt that friendly neighborhood atmosphere. (I suspect things are much different on the weekends.) Remember, this is a residential neighborhood, not a commercial display, so don't make a lot of noise and please respect the residents' privacy. </p>

		<p>&#8216;please respect the residents&#8217; privacy&#8217;???</p>
<p>Hmmm, methinks they&#8217;ve surrendered that right once they put the display up.</p>

		<p>5 years ago when I got to Japan, there weren&#8217;t very many private home Christmas displays. That year, we set up the in-laws&#8217; house with a bunch of net lights on the bushes and some twinkling icicles on the eaves, and we got a lot of attention from the locals.</p>
<p>5 years on, I can&#8217;t convince the in-laws to upgrade the display anymore, and we&#8217;re being shown up by several of the nearby houses.</p>
<p>Whenever I suggest the 9ft snowman and Santa inflatable decorations, I just get scorn. Where&#8217;s their Christmas spirit?</p>

		<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I don&#8217;t care for the whole holiday decoration thing, I despise the Thanksgiving Day parade, and hearing the same Christmas music in every store day after day makes me want to stab my ear drums with a hat pin.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to be a Scrooge, but for God&#8217;s sake be reasonable about it.</p>

		<p>Whenever your guys come down in Valencia area outside of LA in this time of the year, you will be amazed how the local folks decorate their homes and STREETs. Every street has different themes for different years and they are in competition for god knows what. Do not know who start it but it&#8217;s kind stressful to living in the neighborhood!</p>

		<p>I live on one of these &quot;Christmas Tree Lanes&quot; in the Sacramento, CA area.</p>
<p>If you plan on visiting your local Christmas Tree Lane, and you see someone trying to turn left into their driveway, PLEASE STOP AND LET US GET IN.</p>
<p>Sometimes we just sit there with our blinker on and our garage door opened (via remote) while onlookers gawk at our display and drive slowly by without looking around once in a while.</p>
<p>Very frustrating :(</p>

		<p>Dyker Heights is an amusing walk during the summer as well. Lot of religous statues on display.</p>

		<p>For those in the UK: There&#8217;s a similar phenomenon in the village of Southend Bradfield, Berkshire. Every year they seem to get bigger and better decorations to compete with each other. They have quite big gardens visible from the road, so they fill those with decorations, in addition to the ones all over the houses and the big Santas with sleighs and reindeer running across the top of the roof.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a similarly extravagant display somewhere in southern Indiana. They even have a little viewing shelter and a guestbook you can sign.</p>
<p>The difference if I remember correctly, is that it&#8217;s a single dwelling. I couldn&#8217;t imagine the cost in dollars or time.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
