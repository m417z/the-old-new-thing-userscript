		<p>It would be cool if the alalog design was taken advantage of.<br />
For example:<br />
1) Show where I have meetings on the clock face with a small dot or icon.  A mouseover shows full meeting details.<br />
2) Let me replace the 12 hour clock with a stopwatch<br />
3) Let me change the clock to a pie-graph style showing how much longer until something I have set is going to happen (next meeting, end of work day, etc).<br />
4) Show on clock when downloads are expected to be finished (see number 1).<br />
5) Show multiple time zones, or at least a time zone other than my own.<br />
6) Access to set alarms (still can&#8217;t believe a $1500 computer can&#8217;t be *easily* used as a wakeup alarm).</p>

		<p>30-40% of people cannot read an analog clock, so a digital clock is introduced. Longhorn now introduces the HUGE and redundant analog clock for the XX% of people who cannot read a digital clock??! Why bother, except to make the Sidebar look &quot;k3wl dewd&quot;?</p>

		<p>Dylan &#8211; sounds cool. If they don&#8217;t do that stuff I&#8217;m sure there would be room for someone to write a sidebar add-in that does.</p>

		<p>I hope that clock is a prototype-showoff sort of thing thing, and will not be on the default install for Longhorn. Anolog clocks (without the nice features that Dylan describes) are really useless when a digital display can do, and the screen real estate usage is just unacceptable.  Its bad enough already when it looks like aero wastes giant areas of the screen already with the giant IE captionbar and mostly-useless action area directly below the menu.Soon we will all need 30 inch monitors!</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think anybody mentioned it, but Pocket PC&#8217;s clock can be switched to analog. It ends up being smaller than the digital version.</p>
<p>If you look where human factors are most studied&#8211; airplanes, you&#8217;ll see both analog and digital displays simultaneously. Often, the digital displays scroll like the digits were on a drum, to show the current trend.</p>

		<p>An analog clock can be smaller than a digital clock. You can make an analog clock small enough to read the time accurate to 5 minutes fit in the sidebar docked to the left side of the screen one icon wide. I know this because I&#8217;ve seen it done in KDE. Windows unfortunately doesn&#8217;t offer this feature.</p>
<p>The digital clock simply does not fit. Which is a great shame, because I find the taskbar being docked to the left to be the most usable position (less screen wasted, frees vertical space which is more valuable than horizontal space, programs don&#8217;t shift position as you open more, start menu drops down like a normal menu).</p>

		<p>Dylan: First off, you&#8217;re reading Raymond&#8217;s blog, not mine.  (Or perhaps you were thinking of Eric Rudder, or some other Eric.)</p>
<p>Regardless, the server has been having problems all week, apparently due to some hardware issue (whereby &quot;hardware issue&quot; I mean &quot;probably someone didn&#8217;t put enough memory in the box&quot;).  Top minds are looking at the problem.</p>

		<p>The analog clock on Longhorn is beautiful &#8212; the most attractive analog clock I&#8217;ve ever seen on a computer.  It stood out right away.</p>

		<p>Beautiful isn&#8217;t always functional, though.  Look at the gumdrop UI on a Mac and while it is pretty, has some serious functional UI issues.  Apple has always been form before function; and this isn&#8217;t an Apple-bashing post.  </p>
<p>I just think whatever UI Microsoft decides to go with in Longhorn, they do not forget the power users.  I&#8217;m tired of the user interface being dumbed down with every revision of the operating system.</p>

		<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^<br />
I think they probably did a usability study and found that 40% of randomly selected Americans flew into a frenzy and started pecking the computer screen rather than being able to tell the time from an analog display.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
