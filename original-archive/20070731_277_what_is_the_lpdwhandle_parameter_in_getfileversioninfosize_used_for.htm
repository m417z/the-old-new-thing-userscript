<p>The <code>GetFileVersionInfoSize</code> function returns two pieces of information. The return value is the amount of memory needed to record the version information of a file, and the <code>DWORD</code> pointed to by the <code>lpdwHandle</code> parameter is set to zero. What's the deal with this strange <code>lpdwHandle</code> parameter?</p>
<p> That parameter used to do something. </p>
<p> The documentation for <code>GetFileVersionInfo</code> used to read </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> <i>dwHandle</i>: The value returned by a preceding call to <code>GetFileVersionInfoSize</code> in the <code>lpdwHandle</code> parameter. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The purpose of that parameter is to allow <code>GetFileVersionInfoSize</code> to pass information to <code>GetFileVersionInfo</code> about what it found. </p>
<p> In 16-bit Windows and Windows&nbsp;95, 98, and Me, the <code>GetFileVersionInfoSize</code> function opened the target file and went searching for the version information. Once it was located, the size of the version was the return value and the file offset of the version information was stored in <code>lpdwHandle</code>. The <code>GetFileVersionInfo</code> function was very simple: It merely read <code>dwLen</code> bytes from the file starting at file offset <code>dwHandle</code>. </p>
<p> In the Windows&nbsp;NT series, this mechanism was abandoned. The handle is not used any more. Why not? I don't know, but I have some guesses. </p>
<p> First, Windows&nbsp;NT supports files larger than 2GB, so a 32-bit value isn't big enough to hold a file offset value. </p>
<p> Second, multitasking introduces a race condition in the <code>GetFileVersionInfoSize</code>/<code>GetFileVersionInfo</code> pattern. Whereas in 16-bit Windows, nobody could modify the file between the two calls due to co-operative multi-tasking, in 32-bit Windows, it's possible that somebody could sneak in and modify the file between the two calls, resulting in the call to <code>GetFileVersionInfo</code> returning garbage. (Yes, Windows&nbsp;95 has this race condition.) </p>
<p> Third, the amount of memory required to load the version resource is not the same as the actual size of the version resource. It's not enough just to seek to the specified location and read <code>dwLen</code> bytes from it. For example, a program might load the version resources from a 32-bit module, and we've seen earlier that 32-bit version resources are Unicode. But that program might then call <code>VerQueryValueA</code> to retrieve the version string in the ANSI code page. The <code>GetFileVersionInfo</code> function needs to return a buffer that can hold not only the actual version resource but also enough memory to hold copies of all the strings in the version resource converted to the ANSI character set so that the <code>VerQueryValueA</code> function could return them. </p>
<p> Whatever the reason, the Windows&nbsp;NT series of operating systems don't use the handle value. When you call <code>GetFileVersionInfoSize</code>, the function looks for the version resource and returns the size of the memory block needed to record it. (Which, as we saw above, includes translation space for the ANSI strings.) When you call <code>GetFileVersionInfo</code>, the function starts over from scratch and looks for the version resource and copies it into the buffer. </p>
<p> The <code>dwHandle</code> parameter is now just a vestigial organ. </p>
<p> <b>Prediction</b> </p>
<p> People will take this as the opportunity to complain about the <code>GetFileVersionInfo</code> family of functions. (Because all I have to do is mention a function name, and that makes it open season on all problems related to that function, as if every function I mention is one that I have total responsibility and authority over.) </p>

		<p>There is still a race, is there not? &nbsp;If the size of the version info increases between the calls (and assuming your ealier admonition about the size parameter being the buffer size is heeded) the second call will fail to retrieve a complete representation of the version info.</p>
<p>So, to be correct, any program calling this function must do so in a loop, detecting this situation and retrying, right?</p>

		<p>We hold Microsoft and its code to such a high standard; that&#8217;s why we complain when parts of it are hard to understand or hard to use&#8230;. or lack high-level overviews!</p>
<p>But your blog has gone a long way in demystifying many of its parts, and helping us understand why all of MS&#8217;s code can&#8217;t be the way we (each) want it to be.</p>

		<p>Putting in predictions like that creates a nice little paradox &#8211; since people probably won&#8217;t complain about it once you predict that they will.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s *why* he put the prediction in: so people realize the futility and don&#8217;t do it. Still, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be some people who won&#8217;t get the hint, though&#8230;</p>
<p>Neil: I don&#8217;t see how the WM_CTLCOLOR change is anywhere near the same league as changing a function defition in terms of what would break. Besides, as Raymond said, the lpdwHandle parameter was still used in Windows 95.</p>

<p>In many cases, it might just be people with the same experience, because shared misery is half the misery. (And my eyes almost did fall out when I saw what I needed to doto get a DLL&#8217;s version. Not that I&#8217;d be complaning&#8230;)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
