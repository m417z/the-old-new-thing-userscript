		<p>Have you seen &quot;The Ed Helms Report: College Recruiting Edition?&quot; It&#8217;s hillarious! He tries to argue that MS is evil, interviewing people who on Microsoft&#8217;s campus who work there, and comes up with nothing.</p>
<p>Classic moments:</p>
<p>Ed says he first turned to his anonymous sources for information. Just after that, you see him going to Google and searching for &quot;Microsoft evil&quot; or something like that. ;)</p>
<p>&quot;You called it&#8230; the X-BOX?!?!?! &#8230;. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot;</p>
<p>Ed goes around and steals a bunch of free drinks and junk food.</p>
<p>Any chance that video will find its way onto Microsoft&#8217;s site? ;)</p>

		<p>Excellent articles &#8212; thanks for the links.  I love the Daily Show, and that piece by Samantha Bee on bullying was brilliant.</p>

		<p>We were cracking up at the &quot;Rick James&quot; segment from Hattiesburg, MS when it aired a few months ago.  I&#8217;m not surprised he didn&#8217;t win the election.  I figured not many (voting) people in the area watched the daily show.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the funniest segment ever was Stephen Colbert&#8217;s &quot;Storm Tracker Tracker.</p>

		<p>A good friend of mine was interviewed by a Daily Show reporter. Friend asked what he was supposed to do &#8212; try to be funny? Reporter said, &#8216;just play it straight&#8217;, and the reporter did his schtick while my buddy played the straight man.</p>
<p>Same friend was interviewed by a newspaper. Article was about being interviewed on the Daily Show. Another thing Friend said, which came from said article: the Daily Show doesn&#8217;t look to make idiots out of people they interview, so if someone comes off like a complete dolt, it might not be because of the Daily Show.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
