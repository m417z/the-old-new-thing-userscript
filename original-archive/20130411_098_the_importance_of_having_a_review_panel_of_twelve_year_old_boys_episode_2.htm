<p>Microsofties love their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym_and_initialism"> acronyms</a>, but you have to remember to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/01/8445488.aspx"> send every potential name through a review panel of twelve-year-old boys</a> to identify the lurking embarrassments.</p>
<p> When it came time in Windows&nbsp;7 to come up with the names of the various subteams, two of the proposed names were <i><u>C</u>ore <u>O</u>S e<u>X</u>perience</i> and <i><u>F</u>ind and <u>U</u>se e<u>X</u>perience</i>, using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP"> trendy</a> letter X to abbreviate the trendy capitalization of the word <i>eXperience</i>. </p>
<p> The naming system was promptly reconsidered. </p>
<p> One of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/08/17/introducing-the-team.aspx"> the subteams of Windows&nbsp;8</a> is known as <i>User-Centered Experience</i>. The original name of the subteam was the <i>You-Centered Experience</i> (because it's all about you, the user), and they somewhat inadvisedly decided to adopt the nickname <i>YOU</i>, believing themselves to be sooooo clever. </p>
<p> What this actually did was create <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sShMA85pv8M"> Abbot-and-Costello-level confusion</a>. </p>
<p> "There's a work item assigned to YOU to handle this case." </p>
<p> &mdash; <i>No, I don't have any such work item.</i> </p>
<p> "No, not you. I mean the YOU team." </p>
<p> Some time after the standard acronyms and abbreviations for all the teams were settled upon, one of the reporting systems used to track the progress of the project was set up to allow reports to be generated not only for specific individuals or lists of individuals, but also for organizational units or feature teams. If you wanted to generate a report for Bob and everybody who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/07/05/10182985.aspx"> reports through</a> him, you could enter <i>o_bob</i> as the target of the report instead of having to type the name of every single person who worked for Bob. And if you wanted to generate a report for everybody who works on the XYZ feature team, you could enter <i>f_xyz</i>. </p>
<p> This meant that generating the reports for the <i>YOU</i> team required you to type <i>f_you</i>. The members of the <i>YOU</i> team were not pleased by this, and they prevailed upon the people who run the reporting system to change their notation. The request was granted, and the syntax for selecting an entire feature team was changed to <i>ft_xyz</i> instead of just <i>f_xyz</i>. </p>
<p> I would have argued that this was a problem of the YOU team's own creation. Next time, don't pick such a confusing name for your team. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: During Windows&nbsp;XP development, we didn't use these fancy team acronyms. The teams were simply numbered. The kernel and drivers team was team&nbsp;1. The terminal services team was team&nbsp;4. The user interface was team&nbsp;6. I forget most of the other numbers. But as I recall, there was no team&nbsp;7, perhaps in tribute to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/01/8346907.aspx"> Building&nbsp;7</a>. </p>

		<p>BLiTZ / Joshua,</p>
<p>This reminds me of a computer company where I worked 30 years ago: One server was named &quot;and&quot;. The one to the left of it was named &quot;Rock&quot; and the one to the right was named &quot;Roll&quot;&#8230;</p>
<p>A related story from the same caompany and same age:</p>
<p>The OS certainly provided distinct file directories for each user, with password protection and access rights etc, but no subdirectories. Unix was slowly emerging, and the technical part of the customer base was demanding a hierarchical file system. So, an add-on was developed on top of the old FS. User surverys indicated that most non-technical users, accustomed to physical archives, didn&#39;t want arbitrary depth storage, and the FS add-on offered a model consisting of &quot;Cabinets&quot;, with &quot;Drawers&quot;, where &quot;Folders&quot; could hold &quot;Documents&quot;.</p>
<p>A while after the introduction of this system, we heard that the users at one of our prestige customers, a large publishing house, were complaining about the difficulties of remembering in which folder the docuement had been put, which drawer that folder was dropped into, and in which cabinet. They spent a siginficant amount of time searching for documents that had been misplaced in the archives.</p>
<p>At a local user group meetig (the customer was large enough to have its own UG), they discussed how to cope with this problem. One of the ladies stood up and told that she had created a cabinet named Cabinet, with a single drawer, named Drawer, with a single folder, named Folder. In that she put all the documents, so she never had to spend time searching for them. Everyone at the meeting rejoiced and praised the initiative, and after the meeting they all went back to their offices to create one cabinet with one drawer with one folder where everything could be stored. Problem solved.</p>

		<p>Two that I remember from the 80s:</p>
<p>Wang had a slogan, &quot;Wang Cares&quot;. Unfortunately in Britain this didn&#39;t go down quite as well as I assume it did in the USA. (Hint: say quickly)</p>
<p>Another example of US-UK confusion was a debugging tool sold by Tandy/Radio Shack for one of their computers. In the catalogue it was described as being useful to &quot;get rid of little buggers&quot;.</p>
<p>So the moral is, not only do you need a panel of 12 year old boys, but boys from every country you plan to sell in.</p>

		<p>&quot;My Documents&quot; has similar problems. &nbsp;Do you tell someone to go to &quot;my documents&quot;, &quot;your documents&quot;, or more accurately &quot;your my documents&quot;. &nbsp;Having a DOS command named &quot;type&quot; also makes it harder to tell someone to type it.</p>

		<p>I worked for a company in the Seattle area that changed its logo shortly after I left. Had I been there still, I&#39;d have strongly objected. The logo is supposed to represent a person interacting with a kiosk, but instead it rather resembles a man interacting with a urinal.</p>

		<p>Then there was a story from a former manager of mine about a government IT project she was on that was related to sewage treatment plants. They named the project &quot;Sewage Handling Information Tracking System,&quot; but never initialized it in any of the documentation, just to see how far up the chain it would go. It got to a very senior review before it was kicked out.</p>

		<p>@BLiTZ: I can go one better than that. One of our customers had a single server on each of several hundred sites, all cloned from one master image. None of the software on the box cared what the server name was, they couldn&#39;t actually see each other &#8211; so they were *all* called SERVER!</p>
<p>This was actually convenient for part of the client software on the handhelds &#8211; it meant we could effectively hardcode the update URL to <a href="http://server/blah/blah" rel="nofollow">http://server/blah/blah</a>. Sadly, the new back-end system that they replaced it with *does* care what the computer name is, so we can&#39;t do that any more.</p>

		<p>I guess that if they kept Windows XP team numbering scheme for Windows 8 development UI and UX teams would have gotten the largest numbers.</p>

		<p>Just over a dozen years ago, the printing team was called Printing and IMaging People. <a href="mailto:pimp@microsoft.com">pimp@microsoft.com</a> got changed pretty quickly due to the amount of spam it got&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
