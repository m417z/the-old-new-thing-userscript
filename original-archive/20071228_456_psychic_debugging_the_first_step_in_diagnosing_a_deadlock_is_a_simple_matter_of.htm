Somebody asked our team for help
because they believed they hit a deadlock in their program's UI.
(It's unclear why they asked our team,
but I guess since our team uses the window manager,
and their program uses the window manager, we're all in the same boat.
You'd think they'd ask the window manager team for help.)
</p>
<p>
But it turns out that solving the problem required no special
expertise.
In fact, you probably know enough to solve it, too.

<p>
The thing about debugging deadlocks is that you usually
don't need to understand what's going on.
The diagnosis is largely mechanical once you get your foot in the door.
(Though sometimes it's
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/10/661389.aspx">
hard to get your initial footing</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Let's look at thread&nbsp;0.
It is waiting for a critical section.
The owner of that critical section is thread&nbsp;1.
How do I know that?
Well, I could've debugged it, or I could've used my
psychic powers to say,
"Gosh, that function is called <code>LogMsg</code>,
and look there's another thread that is inside the
function <code>LogMsg</code>.
I bet that function is using a critical section to ensure
that only one thread uses it at a time."
</p>
<p>
Okay, so thread&nbsp;0 is waiting for thread&nbsp;1.
What is thread&nbsp;1 doing?
Well, it entered the critical section back in the
<code>LogMsg</code> function,
and then it did some text processing and, oh look,
it's doing a <code>SetScrollInfo</code>.
The <code>SetScrollInfo</code> went into <code>comctl32</code>
and ultimately resulted in a <code>SetWindowLong</code>.
The window that the application passed to
<code>SetScrollInfo</code> is owned by thread&nbsp;0.
How do I know that?
Well, I could've debugged it, or I could've used my
psychic powers to say,
"Gosh, the change in the scroll info has led to a change
in window styles, and the thread is trying to notify the
window of the change in style.
The window clearly belongs to another thread; otherwise we wouldn't
be stuck in the first place,
and given that we see only two threads, there isn't much choice
as to what other thread it could be!"
</p>
<p>
At this point, I think you see the deadlock.
Thread&nbsp;0 is waiting for thread&nbsp;1 to exit the
critical section,
but thread&nbsp;1 is waiting for thread&nbsp;0 to process
the style change message.
</p>
<p>
What happened here is that the program sent a message
while holding a critical section.
Since message handling can trigger hooks and cross-thread activity,
you cannot hold any resources when you send a message because
the hook or the message recipient might want to acquire that
resource that you own,
resulting in a deadlock.</p>

		<p>&quot;is the fact that the &quot;window clearly belongs to another thread&quot; significant?&quot;</p>
<p>I guess the code must behave differently when you call SetScrollInfo() for a window owned by the same thread. &nbsp;The function clearly couldn&#8217;t wait for its own thread to process the style change message in that case, because it&#8217;d never happen until at least SetScrollInfo() returned.</p>

		<p>I think I can see what the original app was doing that caused the wedge.</p>
<p>Thread 0 is the UI thread for FooApp, an app that as part of normal operation displays a logging pane to the user.</p>
<p>Thread 1 is a background listener thread in FooApp that normally waits for external requests, logging messages as it goes.</p>
<p>LogMsg&#8217;s job is, in addition to &#8212; or instead of &#8212; writing an entry to a log file, to display a logged message in the logging pane and scroll to it for the user. Many programs I&#8217;ve seen follow this pattern.</p>
<p>In the course of doing its job, the background thread finds a need to log a message (&quot;New FTP connection to /warez/&quot;) and calls into LogMsg to report this to the user.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the user clicks the close button in the UI, prompting a message to be written to the log (&quot;Shutting down the application&#8230;&quot;).</p>
<p>Hence the deadlock.</p>
<p>Hm&#8230; actually, I think I even know which app we&#8217;re talking about here.</p>

		<p>Oh, forgot to mention: The reason a critical section was probably used is to ensure in-order delivery of log messages, and that log messages would not overprint each other. As well as to make sure that scrolling to the bottom actually scrolls to the bottom. And that LogMsg was written either for a single-threaded environment or for one where SendMessage == PostMessage.</p>

		<p>Okay, maybe I should be more clear. &nbsp;The root cause is a thread that owns a critical section is blocked waiting for another thread, that other thread is trying to also own that lock&#8211;a deadlock. &nbsp;You can have that happen without a window being owned by another thread and without the critical section (or any other locking mechanism) there wouldn&#8217;t be this deadlock. &nbsp;Maybe the fact that communicating to a window owned by another thread is a cross-thread call is overly apparent to me&#8230; &nbsp;My question is, over and above the fact that communicating to a window owned by another thread is a cross-thread call, whether a window clearly belongs to another thread is otherwise significant.</p>

		<p>Your question doesn&#8217;t really make sense. &nbsp;It&#8217;s like asking &quot;Aside from the fact that x is significant, is x significant?&quot; &nbsp;I guess that technically the answer is &quot;no&quot;, but it&#8217;s not really a useful question to ask.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ll take that to mean there is no other significance to the fact that the window is owned by another thread&#8230; &nbsp;i.e. communicating with a window owned by another thread (in the same process) will not introduce other problems when synchronization is not used.</p>

		<p>The question was meant not to be &#8220;Aside from the fact that x is significant, is x significant&#8221; but to be more like &#8220;aside from resulting in a cross-thread call and the resulting side-effects of two threads vying for the same lock, is the fact that &#8216;the window clearly belongs to another thread&#8217; significant&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact that calling SetScrollInfo from a second thread results in a cross-thread call (to the owning thread) was already very obvious to me, &#8220;the window clearly belongs to a another thread&#8221; seemed extraneous and seemed (to me) to imply something more&#8230;</p>

		<p>Funkenbush: No, Raymond&#8217;s Psychic Debugging is based on purely logial leaps based on knowledge and experience. Fixing things using illogical leaps has another name: Guessing.</p>

		<p>Nice post, good WTF. Thank you.</p>
<p>I can think of one way in which the WTF would be even worse; If thread 0 uses MWMO_ALERTABLE to alertably wait on the critical section and thread 1 performs APC on thread 0 before it returns the section. I&#8217;ve never tried any such thing before and probably never will ;)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve always followed the practice of never touching anything UI related from a thread other than the thread that created the UI element. So if I had been writing this app I would have had my LogMsg function post a message to the window that owns the UI element so it could do any UI updating.</p>
<p>In .NET 2.0 a &quot;cross thread call&quot; exception will be thrown if you try to do anything to a UI element from a thead that didn&#8217;t create the element. You have to use an Invoke to run the UI code on the correct thread.</p>

<p>Because your team has Raymond Chen on it, and he&#8217;s got a big &#8216;ol economy-size can of debugging whoop-ass!</p>
<p>Back on topic, this isn&#8217;t a Windows-only thing. Lots of people can&#8217;t get their heads around the fact &quot;thou shalt not make $GUI_TOOLKIT calls in another thread&quot; in GTK, Tk/TCL, or whatever.</p>
<p>I even see people saying &quot;but the thread belongs to the same program, why can&#8217;t it do that?&quot; and they just don&#8217;t understand events, messages, and/or GUI &quot;main&quot; loops at all.</p>
<p>I even had one person ask why two threads couldn&#8217;t be in a critical section at the same time &gt;:-{</p>

		<p>I wonder what application the other team was developing. If they needed outside help on a problem like this, I am really worried about the quality of their product.</p>

		<p>When working within synchronized code, you should only do what needs to be synchronized. From msdn: </p>
<p> &nbsp;&quot;The SetScrollInfo function sets the parameters of a scroll bar, including the minimum and maximum scrolling positions, the page size, and the position of the scroll box (thumb). The function also redraws the scroll bar, if requested.&quot;</p>
<p>I think that the ISV application should *not* have been fiddling with scroll info/position inside of LogMsg. &nbsp;Instead, UI interaction logic should have been performed either before or after the code that is sync&#8217;d by critical section.</p>
<p>IMHO the bigger problem here is poorly designed code. </p>

		<p>&quot;If they needed outside help on a problem like this,&quot;</p>
<p>Well&#8230; Sometimes the obvious solution could be staring you straight in the face, but you won&#8217;t grasp the solution until you get outside help. Even just talking with someone (without any verbal input from the other party) can sometimes dislodge the solution&#8230;</p>
<p>Truth be told, many programmers are not comfortable around debuggers. Here, AFAICT, the schools focus on writing code, not debugging. It is assumed that if something compiles without warnings, then everything is honky-dorey. (And java is their main language/platform from the start)</p>
<p>Actually, the majority of applications are total crap. So you should worry a lot. :)</p>
<p>Personally I started out with the debugger before I wrote much code. I fixed a range check issue with an application someone else wrote, with only the executable to go by (I didn&#8217;t even know, back then, that it had been compiled with TP). At that point (ca 1989) my programming experience was very limited. I doubt many of today&#8217;s kids interact much with debuggers.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t even a GUI-only thing. While writing threaded networking code I learnt the hard way that</p>
<p>there is no good way to take more than one lock in arbitrary order. That&#8217;s basic CS knowledge (does the dining philosophers problem ring any bell ?) but nobody seems to remember these stuff.</p>
<p>Quoted from a linked article:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Hangs and deadlocks are tricky to debug because</p>
<p>  there is no unhandled exception that says, &quot;Look</p>
<p>  at me, I&#8217;m a bug!&quot; Instead, the program just grinds</p>
<p>  to a halt and you have to go spelunking to figure</p>
<p>  out why.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I was just thinking the opposite this afternoon: deadlocks are easier to debug because you can examine the bug live for as long as you want. You don&#8217;t need a test case to reproduce it. When your program crashes, you only have a dump (if you are not too unlucky) which doesn&#8217;t necessarily contains the information you need.</p>
<p>Of course this only applies if the bug happens on the developer&#8217;s computer. If the deadlock happens on a production system on which you are not supposed to install debugging tools I whish you good luck but it shouldn&#8217;t have happened anyway :)</p>

		<p>It all made sense once you got to the punch line, &#8220;&#8230;thread 1 is waiting for thread 0 to process the style change message.&#8221; &nbsp;But then looking again at the stack trace: shouldn&#8217;t one of the last functions in the stack of thread 1 been a SendMessage?</p>
<p>Looking at the help for SetWindowLong </p>
<p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633591.aspx" target="_new" rel="nofollow">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633591.aspx</a> &nbsp;i see no mention that it uses SendMessage, or that it requires the window to be pumping messages. </p>
<p>Otherwise this turns into one of those things that we have to watch out for because it said so on that blog, rather than in the docs.</p>
<p>The only exception might be if you&#8217;re using SetWindowLong(GWL_WNDPROC) to subclass a window, but even then it would only affect the next message, not the handling of any current one.</p>
<p>Without the tidbit from The Old New Thing blog that SetWindowLong requires the owner to be pumping messages i would never have found the cause of the deadlock. i&#8217;d be sitting at SetScrollInfo() in a debugger and asking, &#8220;How can SetScrollInfo possibly cause a deadlock?&#8221;</p>

		<p>[If the thread isn&#8217;t pumping messages, how can it receive the style change message? -Raymond]</p>
<p>Ahh, the WM_STYLECHANGED message. &quot;The WM_STYLECHANGED message is sent to a window after the SetWindowLong function has changed one or more of the window&#8217;s styles.&quot;</p>
<p>Having a mention of such a message in SetWindowLong documentation would have been very helpful to the original guys &#8211; and me if i were faced with the same deadlock.</p>
<p>Added mention to the community content section of SetWindowLong()</p>

		<p>Is it better to avoid using SendMessage from a worker thread to a window in general (and use PostMessage instead), or is this only true when a resource is being held by the worker thread?</p>

		<p>Jonathan: I&#8217;m not sure about &quot;in general&quot;, but the very fact that the worker thread hasn&#8217;t exited is sometimes a resource. &nbsp;I.e., say the window&#8217;s thread is trying to shut down, and has set an event that all the worker threads are supposed to wait on, and exit if it gets set. &nbsp;The window&#8217;s thread wants to ensure all the worker threads are actually gone (so that the process doesn&#8217;t stay running), so it joins each of them after setting the event.</p>
<p>Now if one of those worker threads got some other notification just before the event was set, and is trying to SendMessage to the window&#8217;s thread, but the window&#8217;s thread is trying to join the worker thread, that&#8217;s the same type of deadlock. &nbsp;PostMessage, OTOH, would work fine (although the notification would be lost).</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ve run into this several times using .net&#8217;s Invoke() from worker threads. &nbsp;The solution was to use BeginInvoke() (mostly equivalent to PostMessage) and ensure that the worker thread didn&#8217;t need to know what the window&#8217;s thread did with the notification (so it didn&#8217;t need to wait for its processing to finish). &nbsp;If you did need to wait, you could use the WaitHandle exposed by .net&#8217;s IAsyncResult (wait on both it and the shutdown event), but IMO it&#8217;s better to make the notification really be a notification, if possible.)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
