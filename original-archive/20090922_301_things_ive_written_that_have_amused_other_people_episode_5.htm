<p>A question was sent to an internal discussion list for users of the XYZ tool:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>From</b>: Q<br> <b>To</b>: XYZ Users  The GHI function in the JKL tool doesn't work for me. &laquo;description of problem deleted&raquo; </p>

<p> I responded with this message: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>To</b>: Q, XYZ Users  The JKL tool is not part of XYZ. You should contact the author of the JKL tool. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The reason why people were amused by this is that the author of the JKL tool is <i>me</i>. (Says so right there in the online help.) </p>
<p> As a final punch line, the person never did contact me. </p>

		<p>Well, if the problem was a valid one, still address the issue raised. But yeah, don&#8217;t reward someone spamming the wrong support channel if they should have known better.</p>
<p>Just because they picked a random mailing list that happens to include the correct person this time doesn&#8217;t mean they will next time- and learning basic skills like &quot;Talking to the right person&quot; is important.</p>

		<p>I must say, you did exactly the right thing. If he can&#8217;t even figure out who wrote JKL, think about the harm he might cause if he got it to work.</p>

		<p>I dunno. If he&#8217;s using the JKL tool in the context of XYZ, he was probably expecting that other users of XYZ were also using JKL and could provide help or had encountered the same error.</p>
<p>My guess? Someone on the mailing *was* indeed using the tool and could help him and answered in private.</p>

		<p>My reading of this is that Q knew that he wanted help from Raymond, but didn&#8217;t want to ask. So, he asks a larger group that he knows Raymond is part of, hoping that he answers.</p>
<p>I suspect that Raymond knows this and thwarted this tactic deliberately.</p>

		<p>dave: A lot of people don&#8217;t get &quot;supported&quot; either. I remember an example from the Mac version of Windows Remote Desktop, where it didn&#8217;t support entering an IP address for the remote machine.</p>
<p>A buddy of mine was like, &quot;how am I supposed to connect to it? It only has an IP address!&quot; I said, &quot;just try plugging the IP address in and see if it works.&quot;</p>
<p>It worked, of course. But then he got all worked-up over the fact that the Read Me said it wasn&#8217;t supported. Ugh.</p>
<p>&quot;not supported&quot; != &quot;doesn&#8217;t work&quot;.</p>

		<p>Wait&#8230; you&#8217;re the author of SQL Server? Like, personally? (I&#8217;m kidding, of course)</p>
<p>But seriously&#8230; &#8220;internal tool&#8221; isn&#8217;t an obvious meaning of &#8220;unannounced product&#8221;. The default assumption for &#8220;unannounced&#8221; is that this is not a permanent state, and the most obvious meaning of &#8220;product&#8221; is something that is or will eventually be sold to &#8220;customers&#8221;.</p>

		<p>R. is afraid of announcing a deprecated internal tool? Who would care? If this could make you lose your job, then your employer isn&#8217;t one that you would like to work for anyway.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>&#8220;Hey, Raymond, that&#8217;s an interesting name for your tool. What does it do? Wow, that&#8217;s a great insight into Microsoft&#8217;s proprietary internal systems for managing product development. I had no idea you guys had something like that. I think I&#8217;ll develop a system just like it. Oh, and what algorithm does your tool use? Wow, that&#8217;s neat. I think I&#8217;ll use that cool algorithm and thereby erode Microsoft&#8217;s advantage in bringing products to market through more efficient processes. Thanks for all the info. Couldn&#8217;t have done it without you! Sorry about the leak investigation, though. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find another job somewhere eventually.&#8221; -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Since you didn&#8217;t preempt the inevitable snarky comments, I feel I must oblige&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;Microsoft&#8217;s advantage&#8230;through more efficient processes&quot;? You mean like Microspeak? Or the Vista development process?</p>
<p>(Seriously, though, your point is well taken, I just couldn&#8217;t let such a golden opportunity pass me by.)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
