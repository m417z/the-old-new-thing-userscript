        Bitmap brushes used to be these little 8x8 monochrome patterns that you could use
        for hatching and maybe little houndstooth patterns if you were really crazy. But you
        can do better. 
    </p>
<p>
        CreatePatternBrush lets you pass in any old bitmap - even a huge one, and it will
        create a brush from it. The bitmap will automatically be tiled, so this is a quick
        way to get bitmap tiling. Let GDI do all the math for you! 
    </p>
<p>
        This is particularly handy when you're stuck with a mechanism where you are forced
        to pass an <code>HBRUSH</code> but you really want to pass an <code>HBITMAP</code>.
        Convert the bitmap to a brush and return that brush instead. 
    </p>
<p>
        For example, let's take our scratch program and give it a custom tiled background
        by using a pattern brush. 
    </p>
<pre>HBRUSH CreatePatternBrushFromFile(LPCTSTR pszFile)
{
    HBRUSH hbr = NULL;
    HBITMAP hbm = (HBITMAP)LoadImage(g_hinst, pszFile,
                   IMAGE_BITMAP, 0, 0, LR_LOADFROMFILE);
    if (hbm) {
        hbr = CreatePatternBrush(hbm);
        DeleteObject(hbm);
    }
    return hbr;
}

BOOL
InitApp(LPSTR lpCmdLine)
{
    BOOL fSuccess = FALSE;
    HBRUSH hbr = CreatePatternBrushFromFile(lpCmdLine);
    if (hbr) {
        WNDCLASS wc;
    
        wc.style = 0;
        wc.lpfnWndProc = WndProc;
        wc.cbClsExtra = 0;
        wc.cbWndExtra = 0;
        wc.hInstance = g_hinst;
        wc.hIcon = NULL;
        wc.hCursor = LoadCursor(NULL, IDC_ARROW);
        wc.hbrBackground = hbr;
        wc.lpszMenuName = NULL;
        wc.lpszClassName = CLASSNAME;
    
        fSuccess = RegisterClass(&amp;wc);
        // Do not delete the brush - the class owns it now
    }
    return fSuccess;
}
</pre>
<p>
        With a corresponding adjustment to <code>WinMain</code>: 
    </p>
<pre>    if (!InitApp(lpCmdLine)) return 0;
</pre>
<p>
        Pass the path to a *.bmp file on the command line, and bingo, the window will tile
        its background with that bitmap. Notice that we did not have to change anything other
        than the class registration. No muss, no fuss, no bother. 
    </p>
<p>
        Here's another way you can use bitmap brushes to save yourself a lot of work. Start
        with a new scratch program and change it as follows: 
    </p>
<pre>HBRUSH g_hbr; // the pattern brush we created

HBRUSH CreatePatternBrushFromFile(LPCTSTR pszFile)
{ ... same as above ... }

void
PaintContent(HWND hwnd, PAINTSTRUCT *pps)
{
    BeginPath(pps-&gt;hdc);
    Ellipse(pps-&gt;hdc, 0, 0, 200, 100);
    EndPath(pps-&gt;hdc);
    HBRUSH hbrOld = SelectBrush(pps-&gt;hdc, g_hbr);
    FillPath(pps-&gt;hdc);
    SelectBrush(pps-&gt;hdc, hbrOld);
}
</pre>
<p>
        And add the following code to WinMain before the call to <code>CreateWindowEx</code>: 
    </p>
<pre>    g_hbr = CreatePatternBrushFromFile(lpCmdLine);
    if (!g_hbr) return 0;
</pre>
<p>
        This time, since we are managing the brush ourselves we need to remember to 
    </p>
<pre>    DeleteObject(g_hbr);
</pre>
<p>
        at the end of WinMain before it returns. 
    </p>
<p>    This program draws an ellipse filled with your bitmap. The <code>FillPath</code> function
    uses the currently-selected brush, so we select our bitmap brush (instead of a boring
    solid brush) and draw with that. Result: A pattern-filled ellipse. Without a bitmap
    brush, you would have had to do a lot of work manually clipping the bitmap (and tiling
    it) to the ellipse.

		<p>You can&#8217;t PaintDesktop into a memory DC because PaintDesktop does an EnumDisplayMonitors to render the desktop on each monitor, but a memory DC doesn&#8217;t have any monitors.</p>
<p>There was nothing in particular to inspire this topic. Sometimes I&#8217;ll just write about something I think doesn&#8217;t get written about enough.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m programming a GINA, and debugging using the checked version of Winlogon. Look this err message:</p>
<p>RTL: RtlNtStatusToDosError(0x52e): No Valid Win32 Error Mapping<br />
RTL: Edit ntosrtlgenerr.c to correct the problem<br />
RTL: ERROR_MR_MID_NOT_FOUND is being returned<br />
156.88&gt; Winlogon-Trace-SAS: LOGONNOTIFY message 9</p>
<p>Can you send the file, so I can correct the problem??? LOL :)<br />
Yesterday my VS.NET asked me for some .c file from NT kernel. I told him I don&#8217;t have, and he said: &quot;ok, take this assembly code instead&quot;. :-)</p>

		<p>I have two questions for Raymond but couldn&#8217;t find a way to email  him directly. Why has fast alt tab switching in Windows not been working exactly as it should since I can remember. I am a web developer so usually have several apps open when developing. It seems the algorithm for what you last used when alt-tab switching sometimes puts the last app you used at the bottom of the stack, so you have to tab through the 14 other windows just to get to the one you used immediately previous to switching. And to top it off, this action seems intermittent. Sometimes it works great, other times it works as I described. Have you come across this bizarre behaviour at all?</p>
<p>Also the other thing I wanted to ask about is when you right click on an item in the task bar, you get a pop-up menu with the Close (Alt F4) option listed at the bottom.  Standard fair in Windows‚Ä¶right.</p>
<p>I got into a habit of closing down windows by right clicking then selecting the bottom option. Which works great except for those apps that don&#8217;t have Close as the bottom option in the right click menu &#8211; they have something else instead. Examples are any HTML Help app, which have ‚ÄúAbout HTML Help‚Äù, and MS Windows own Help window, which has &quot;Go To&quot; as the bottom option‚Ä¶(yeah that‚Äôs intuitive).</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could shed any light on these two idiosyncrasies?</p>

		<p>Anthony-I haven&#8217;t any explanation, just this note: Alt-shift-tab iterates the coolswitch list backwards if that happens to you (ie your app moves to the end of the list).</p>

		<p>Anthony &#8211; about tastk switching<br />
the app moves to the bottom of the stack when minimized. If you just use alt-tab it will be the next.</p>

		<p>Also, for the taskbar context menu, it mirrors the system menu &#8212; the menu you get when you click on the application icon of a window.  Applications are free to modify this menu as they wish (more or less).  Some applications choose to put additional items on this menu.</p>

<p>You can hold Ctrl key while selecting items in task bar. Then right click and you&#8217;ll get &quot;common denominator&quot; menu for them. So, you&#8217;ll be able to close (minimize, etc.) all of them at once.</p>

		<p>If you want to suggest a topic, add a comment or email me. (Note that I get approximately a thousand of pieces of email a week, and that&#8217;s not counting the spam, so please don&#8217;t be hurt if I don&#8217;t personally acknowledge your message. I did get it and I did read it.) Note that I often decide not to comment on a topic because I don&#8217;t feel qualified to discuss it, or discussing it would reveal proprietary information, or because I don&#8217;t think the topic is of general interest. Again, please don&#8217;t be offended if this happens to your topic.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
