<p>When my niece was in kindergarten, a regular classroom assignment was for students to write a few sentences about something happening in their lives. For one of the assignments, my niece wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> My auntie has a baby in her tumy. If it is a boy I will call him Kevin. If it is a grl I will call her Alula. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> We have no idea where the name "Alula" came from. </p>
<p> The baby turned out to be a girl, but her aunt chose a different name. </p>
<p> My niece did not hold up her end of the bargain and call her new cousin "Alula". </p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: Upon further reflection, I think the proposed boy's name was "Derik", not Kevin. Not important to the story, but included for completeness. </p>

		<p>Similar things does happen&#8230;</p>
<p>Chinese family have tradition to choose name (something like nickname) to call a child when he/she is young.</p>
<p>Before my cousin&#39;s second daugther was born, her family have already chosen that nickname and the real name for her.</p>
<p>A few month after she was born, her sister misspoken her nickname once, and that misspoken nickname (which sounds exactly like a common English name) becomes how we call her now because we think it&#39;s funny.</p>

		<p>Of course, &quot;X&#39;s sister-in-law&quot; isn&#39;t the only solution to &quot;X&#39;s niece&#39;s aunt&quot; &#8211; It could also mean a second sibling of X.</p>
<p>&quot;My niece&#39;s aunt&quot; (which Raymond of course did not, in fact, say) would only be the most efficient term to describe someone if the structure is as ChrisG described but the niece&#39;s parents are not married to each other.</p>

		<p>@Worf: for &quot;blood&quot; relations see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/matthew_van_eerde/archive/2009/04/27/second-cousins-cousins-once-removed-relationships-by-generations-to-common-ancestor.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/second-cousins-cousins-once-removed-relationships-by-generations-to-common-ancestor.aspx</a> (doesn&#39;t include &quot;by marriage&quot; types of relationships like sibling-in-law)</p>
<p>I see four solutions to &quot;X&#39;s niece&#39;s aunt:&quot;</p>
<p>X has parent P1 and sibling S1, who has a daughter N.</p>
<p>A has parent P2 and sibling S2, who has the same daughter N.</p>
<p>Solution 1: P1 != P2, S1 != S2. &nbsp;X and A are siblings-in-law, no blood relation.</p>
<p>Solution 2: P1 != P2, S1 = S2. &nbsp;X and A are, um, half-siblings, I guess (they have a sibling in common)</p>
<p>Solution 3: P1 = P2, S1 = S2, X != A. &nbsp;X and A are siblings.</p>
<p>Solution 4: P1 = P2, S1 = S2, X = A. &nbsp;X and A are the same person (doesn&#39;t work if X is known not to be female.)</p>

		<p>You guys missed what I was saying entirely. &nbsp;My point was, Raymond&#39;s neice&#39;s aunt could possibly be one of multiple siblings of Raymond or Raymond&#39;s wife. Or, it could actually be Raymond&#39;s wife herself! Which would make the daughter&#8230;well hopefully you get the point now. &nbsp;Also we know Raymond is famously coy about his personal life. &nbsp;Just trying to stir the pot a little for some nosy fun.</p>

		<p>I gather that your niece wrote this in English, but it reminds me of one of the aspects of Mandarin I&#39;ve always found particularly challenging: the specific denotations of different members of the extended family. I may be misremembering, but I seem to recall that there are different terms not just for aunts on the paternal and maternal sides, but for aunts who are younger or older than the subject&#39;s parents. As someone who came from a smallish family and who used the word &quot;cousin&quot; loosely to describe any relation roughly of my generation who wasn&#39;t my sibling, it&#39;s all thoroughly confusing and delightful.</p>
<p>Ah, a correction: My Taipei-born wife tells me it&#39;s actually a bit more involved than that. Aunts are differentiated by maternal and paternal side, but not by birth order. Uncles are differentiated by maternal and paternal side, and by birth order on the paternal side only. Perhaps this relates somehow to traditional inheritance rules? Cousins are named based on a 2x2x2 matrix with the dimensions maternal/paternal, older/younger, male/female. (Tang/biao for paternal/maternal, followed by ge/di for older/younger male, just like brothers, or jie/mei for older/younger female, like sisters. Hope I got that right.)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
