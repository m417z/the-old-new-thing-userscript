The Nineys are an award which recognizes those who have had the greatest impact on the technical/developer community over the past year. Winners are selected by you, the technical/developer community.</p>
<p> The winners will be announced at the <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/"> MIX11 conference</a> in April. But before they can announce winners, they need to collect votes. </p>
<p> That's where you come in. </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22BQU9KHP5G/"> Cast your vote online</a> in the following categories: </p>
<ul>
<li>Favorite     <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Browse/Shows/">     Channel 9 Show</a> (video) of 2010 </li>
<li>Favorite     <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Browse/Series/">     Channel 9 Series</a> (video) of 2010 </li>
<li>Favorite Community Show (video) of 2010 </li>
<li>Favorite Twitter User of 2010 </li>
<li>Most Helpful Niner of 2010 </li>
<li>Channel 9 Video of the Year for 2010 </li>
<li>Favorite New Microsoft Technology or Product for 2010 </li>
<li>Favorite CodePlex Project of 2010 </li>

<li>Favorite Blog About Microsoft of 2010 </li>
<li>Favorite Audio Podcast of 2010 </li>
<li>Favorite Web Site Design of 2010 </li>
</ul>
<p> Now, it so happens that among the nominees is an author of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/07/1233002.aspx"> a somewhat unsucessful book on programming</a> (not to be confused with an author of several <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/?field-author=Mark+Russinovich&amp;node=5&amp;tag=tholneth-20"> successful books on programming</a> and a <a href="http://www.zerodaythebook.com/"> to-be-published novel</a>) but please don't let that distract you from voting for whoever you feel best deserves to win. </p>

		<p>Wow, I was shocked I didn&#39;t have to register to vote in that. &nbsp;I was also pleasantly surprised to find that I could abstain from voting in categories I knew nothing about. &nbsp;Good job, whoever set up that vote, although I hope you have good safeguards in place to avoid vote fraud.</p>

		<p>Favorite Microsoft Blogger: Mark, Raymond and Larry in the same category DOH. Since Mark has gone to the dark side (The cloud) and Larry has really been slacking off lately, the vote has to go to the oldnewthing ;)</p>

		<p>For some questions almost every answer is awesome.</p>
<p>For example in blogs. Was a bit surprised that Eric Lippert wasn&#39;t listed there. While not as entertaining as oldnewthing his blog is very helpful for C# programmers. And of course he answers many tricky questions on stackoverflow.</p>
<p>In the product category it&#39;s hard to decide. .net is awesome of course. But finally having an Internet Explorer that renders most stuff correctly is very nice too.</p>
<p>On the other hand the web design question&#8230; I&#39;d use them as examples on how not to make a website. Two displayed a message that they don&#39;t like my browser, one didn&#39;t work at all(8 ball), one was annoyingly busy(AP) and the final one loaded for ages(mural).</p>

		<p>Wow, Mark is doing pretty good. &quot;Inside Microsoft Windows 2000, Third Edition&quot; seems to be retailing for $1,295 these days, in CD-ROM format no less!</p>

		<p>I&#39;m only interested in voting for a couple of these categories. I know very little about the rest of them. Unfortunately, it&#39;s an all-or-nothing ballot, so I can&#39;t vote.</p>

		<p>OK this a tough choice between Raymond Chen &amp; Mark Russonvich&#8230;my two favorite bloggers on the MS site. On the plus side The Old New Thing is the most entertaining programming book i&#39;ve ever read. On the downside will we ever see another book? I&#39;d pre-order it! But then again&#8230;Mark Russonvich is still to come up with Windows Internals 6 release&#8230;his new novel better be VERY GOOD&#8230;to make up for that&#8230;</p>

		<p>Difficult choice on Raymond Chen &amp; Mark Russinovich, but in the end it boils down to frequency. While I enjoy the often long readings of Mark&#39;s blog entries when they occur, Raymond provides a steady flow of large-enough-chunks-of enjoyment through his everyday postings.</p>

		<p>@BurakKALAYCI: Is this kind of a microspeak when you say &#39;technical/developer community&#39;, you really mean &#39;Channel 9 community&#39; or &#39;Microsoft community&#39;?</p>
<p>That&#39;s just the Redmond Reality Distortion Field. &nbsp;Developer and &quot;Windows Developer&quot; are entirely synonymous, and anyone who believes otherwise is an Apple Weenie or Linux Communist.</p>

		<p>I voted for Mark. &nbsp;He never makes fun of people who ask un-educated questions, unlike Ray. &nbsp;Ray seems to get a kick out saying &quot;Ha, you are stupid for not knowing everything I do!&quot;.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
