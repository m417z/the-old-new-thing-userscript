<p>Some time ago I mentioned that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/01/22/9951750.aspx"> during process termination, the gates are now electrified</a>: If you attempt to enter a critical section that is owned by a thread that was terminated by an earlier phase of process termination, the entire process is forcibly terminated.</p>
<p> Windows Vista introduced a new lightweight synchronization pseudo-object known as the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa904937.aspx"> slim reader/writer lock</a>. And if you tried to enter a slim reader/writer lock during process termination and found yourself waiting for the current owner to release it, <a href="http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/2006/11/19/VistaSRWLockAcquiresDuringShutdown.aspx"> you ended up waiting forever</a> since the current owner was terminated by an earlier phase of process termination. The sentence "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/05/03/2383346.aspx">As for the home-grown stuff, well, you're on your own</a>" applies here. Even though the slim reader/writer lock functions are exported from <code>kernel32.dll</code>, they don't have any special kernel powers with respect to process termination. From the standpoint of process termination, they may as well be some home-grown synchronization primitive. </p>
<p> In Windows&nbsp;7, the kernel folks decided to bring slim reader/writer locks into the fold of <i>objects which are electrified during process termination</i>. Starting in Windows&nbsp;7, if you attempt to acquire a slim reader/writer lock during process termination, and the lock cannot be immediately acquired, then the process is forcibly terminated. </p>

		<p>Can you clarify the difference (if any) between the behavior of critical sections and slim reader/writer locks? &nbsp;In particular, the conditions you wrote lead to process termination are &quot;If you attempt to enter a critical section that is owned by a thread that was terminated by an earlier phase of process termination&hellip;&quot; and &quot;if you attempt to acquire a slim reader/writer lock during process termination, and the lock cannot be immediately acquired&quot;.</p>
<p>Note the discrepancy between the two. &nbsp;For critical sections, you only get terminated if the critical section is owned by a thread that&#39;s been terminated (very reasonable, since obviously that critical section is never going to be released). &nbsp;But for slim reader/writer locks, apparently even if the lock is simply held by some other still-running thread, that&#39;s enough to get the process killed.</p>
<p>Are the two criteria really different? &nbsp;If so, could you please elaborate on the motivation behind having different rules for the two different kinds of locks?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>There is no difference. There is no such thing as &quot;some other still-running thread&quot;, since all other threads have been terminated! In both cases, the rule is &quot;if the lock cannot be immediately acquired.&quot; I just expanded the definition of &quot;cannot be immediately acquired&quot; in the critical section case. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Is slim lock (as well as crit-sect) territory considered kernel folk turf? As far as I understand, it&#39;s pretty much usermode stuff. Also, are mutexes electrified? I guess not. But they have a separate status for such cases.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Right, SRW locks and critical sections are user-mode objects. I thought I explained that in the second paragraph. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>All of this is common sense. When you are terminating, you don&#39;t want to have a dependency on something that has already been shut down.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to just look at the source code and see that ReaderWriterLockSlim is implemented in C#. The ReaderWriterLock appears to be implemented with Windows APIs.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
