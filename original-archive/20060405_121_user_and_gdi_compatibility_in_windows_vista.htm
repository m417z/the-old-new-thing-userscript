<p>My colleague <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickkramer/"> Nick Kramer</a> who works over on WPF has the first of what will be a series of articles on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickkramer/archive/2006/04/04/567769.aspx"> USER and GDI compatibility in Windows Vista</a>. The changes to tighten security, improve support for East Asian languages, and take the desktop to a new level with the Desktop Window Manager (among others) make for quite an interesting compatibility risk list.</p>
<p> And since I mentioned the DWM, you would do well to check out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/greg_schechter/"> Greg Schechter</a> who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/greg_schechter/archive/2006/03/25/561167.aspx"> has been writing about the Desktop Window Manager</a>, how it works, how it fits into the rest of the system, all that stuff. I know some people have been posting comments asking for information about the DWM. You would be much better served asking Greg since he actually works on it, whereas all I know about the DWM is how to spell it. </p>

		<p>Sometimes I feel like an old curmudgeon; bah, give me a lite Vista without this new goo and I will continue to run my non-video intensive apps and life with click-and-drag weirdness on my Trio64. Sheesh!</p>
<p>At other times, I feel like I would dread to have even another Vista version and I will bear the transition with everyone else. Change is change; it will be better.</p>
<p>I feel like a curmudgeon just mentioning this somewhat tread-upon topic.</p>

		<p>Interesting read. &quot;when applications do painting that&#8217;s not part of a WM_PAINT&quot; almost sounds like a post title on this blog :)</p>
<p>I always use InvalidateRect to have Windows send the proper WM_PAINT message. Makes the program much more procedural, and that makes the program more robust and easier to maintain.</p>

		<p>Windows Vista having &#8216;live&#8217; content of everything currently on the screen is very exciting news for me: that&#8217;s how they manage to have a &#8216;live&#8217; snapshot of tasks in the taskbar. Cool. :-)</p>

		<p>I always wanted to ask, but could not find a relevant thread. Anyway, why do you explain how to work with WinAPI, if Vista will have WinFX and all .Net related new API? Does it still make sense to learn WinAPI for those who don&#8217;t know it well?</p>

		<p>Isn&#8217;t it great that we now have an egg timer than can suck up 35% of the CPU time?<br /></p>

		<p>Hehe!</p>
<p>But, come on, every OS version release has raised the &#8216;minimum expected hardware to run&#8217; level. I still remember thinking 8 MB of memory was a lot of RAM to run Win 3.0 in. In those days, a single video file was enough to fill your hard disk.</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t you glad the hardware has evolved to keep up with the software? With the current processors you can do things in a normal desktop PC you wouldn&#8217;t dream of 10 years ago. </p>
<p>Software that pushes the envelope of what can be done with current hardware *is* a good thing: it stimulates evolution on the hardware front, allowing you to do more and better things&#8230; like egg timers. ;-)</p>

		<p>I do all my painting outside of WM_PAINT. Thats all to an offscreen cache of my window contents however. Then of course I blit *that* to my window.</p>
<p>I havn&#8217;t yet found a better way to write a high fps &quot;game&quot; using straight GDI.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
