<p>
We received a security vulnerability report that went roughly like this:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
There is a security vulnerability in the X&nbsp;component.
It loads <code>shell32.dll</code> from the current directory,
thereby making it vulnerable to a current directory attack.
Here is a sample program that illustrates the problem.
Copy a rogue <code>shell32.dll</code> into the current directory
and run the program.
Observe that the rogue
<code>shell32.dll</code> is loaded instead of the system one.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you actually followed the instructions,
what you saw depended on your definition of "run the program."
Let's assume that the program has been placed in the directory
<code>C:\<wbr>sample\<wbr>sample.exe</code>.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting the current directory to the application directory.
<pre>
cd /d C:\sample
copy \\rogue\server\shell32.dll
c:\sample\sample.exe
</pre>
<p>In this case, the attack succeeds.</p>
<li>Setting the current directory to an unrelated directory.
<pre>
cd /d %USERPROFILE%
copy \\rogue\server\shell32.dll
c:\sample\sample.exe
</pre>
<p>In this case, the attack fails.</p>
<li>Running the application from Explorer.
<pre>
copy \\rogue\server\shell32.dll C:\sample
<i>double-click sample.exe in Explorer</i>
</pre>
<p>In this case, the attack succeeds.
</ol>
<p>
Let's look at case&nbsp;3 first.
In case&nbsp;3, what is the current directory?
When you launch a program from Explorer,
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/11/10/10088566.aspx">
the current directory is set to the directory of the thing
you double-clicked</a>.
Therefore, case&nbsp;3 is identical to case&nbsp;1.
That's one less case to have to study.
</p>
<p>
We also see that the attack
is not strictly a current directory attack,
because the attack failed in case&nbsp;2
even though a rogue <code>shell32.dll</code> was in the current directory.
</p>
<p>
What we're actually seeing is an <i>application directory</i> attack.
</p>
<p>
Recall that the application directory is searched ahead of the
system directory.
Therefore, you can override a file in the system directory
by putting it in your application directory.
This is part of the
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/20/10176772.aspx">
<i>directory as a bundle</i> principle</a>.
If you packaged a DLL with your application,
then presumably that's the one you want,
even if a future version of Windows decides to create a DLL of the same name.
</p>
<p>
The vulnerability report sort of acknowledged that this was
an application directory attack rather than a current directory
attack when they explained why this is a serious problem:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
By placing a rogue copy of <code>shell32.dll</code> in the
<code>C:\<wbr>Program Files\<wbr>Microsoft Office\<wbr
>Office12</code> directory,
an attacker can inject arbitrary code into all Office applications.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the attack were really a current directory attack,
the attacker would have put a rogue copy of
<code>shell32.dll</code> in the directory containing your
Excel spreadsheet, not the directory containing
<code>EXCEL.EXE</code>.
</p>
<p>
And that's where you reach the airtight hatchway:
Normal users do not have write permission into the
<code>C:\<wbr>Program Files\<wbr>Microsoft Office\<wbr
>Office12</code> directory.
You need administrator privileges to create files there.
And if you have administrator privileges,
then you already pwn the machine.
It's not really a vulnerability that you can do anything you want
once you pwn the machine.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this non-vulnerability does expose a security
issue you need to bear in mind when you run your own programs:
Your application's directory is its airtight hatchway.
Make sure you control who you let in!
If you leave your application directory world-writeable,
then you've effectively left your airtight hatchway unlocked.
This is one reason why the Microsoft Logo guidelines
recommend (require?) that programs be
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/03/07/10278793.aspx">
installed into the
Program Files directory</a>:
The default security descriptor for subdirectories of Program Files
does not grant write permission to normal users.
It's secure by default.
</p>
<p>
There are many variations of this type of vulnerability report,
and they nearly always are mischaracterized as a current directory attack.
They usually go like this:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
There is a DLL planting vulnerability in LITWARE.EXE.
Place a rogue DLL named SHELL32.DLL in the same directory as LITWARE.EXE.
When LITWARE.EXE is run, the rogue DLL is loaded from the current directory,
resulting in code injection.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The person who submits the report has confused the application directory
with the current directory, probably because they never considered that
the two might be different.
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; mkdir C:\test
C:\&gt; cd C:\test
C:\test&gt; copy \\trusted\server\LITWARE.EXE
C:\test&gt; copy \\rogue\server\SHELL32.DLL
C:\test&gt; LITWARE
-- observe that the rogue DLL is loaded
-- proof of current directory attack
</pre>
<p>
They never tried this:
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; mkdir C:\test
C:\&gt; cd C:\test
C:\test&gt; copy \\trusted\server\LITWARE.EXE
C:\&gt; mkdir C:\test2
C:\&gt; cd C:\test2
C:\test2&gt; copy \\rogue\server\SHELL32.DLL
C:\test2&gt; ..\test\LITWARE
-- observe that the rogue DLL is not loaded
</pre>
<p>
That second experiment shows that the attack is not a current
directory attack at all.
It's an application directory attack.
</p>
<p>
Each time one of these reports comes in, we have to perform
the same evaluation to confirm that it really is an application
directory attack and not a current directory attack.
(This means, among other things, repeating the test on every
version of Windows, and every version of LitWare, and every
combination of the two, just to make sure all the possibilities
have been covered.
The odds are strong that it will all turn into a false alarm,
but who knows. Maybe there's something about the interaction between
LitWare 5.2 SP2
and Windows&nbsp;XP SP3 that triggers a new code path that
does indeed try to load <code>shell32.dll</code> from the
current directory.
And it's that specific combination of circumstances the person
was trying to report, but did a bad job of expressing.)</p>

		<p>As a (related) aside, what would be the set of magic calls you should do in your main() for new programs? I have come up with:</p>
<p>SetProcessDEPPolicy(PROCESS_DEP_ENABLE);</p>
<p>SetDllDirectoryW(L&quot;&quot;);</p>
<p>SetSearchPathMode(BASE_SEARCH_PATH_ENABLE_SAFE_SEARCHMODE | BASE_SEARCH_PATH_PERMANENT);</p>
<p>plus a RegisterApplicationRestart() before the main loop. (Of course, using GetProcAddress for all calls, so it will not break on Windows XP.)</p>
<p>The SetDllDirectoryW call would be the one which prevents the sort of vulnerability being discussed, since IIRC it removes the current directory from the search path.</p>

		<p>Why not ask the submitter: are you sure this is an X attack and not a Y attack? &nbsp;We&#39;ve tested this and can only reproduce it as a Y attack. &nbsp;Which version of Litware are you running?</p>

		<p>i discovered a way to make this attack work even i do have not write permissions to the applications directory. I create a new folder in a location i have access to, such as my Desktop, i then copy the contents of the application folder to the folder on my desktop, replace shell32.dll since i have write access to that folder and run the application from this location! /Scarcasm</p>

		<p>This entirely ignores the fact that if you have administrative access to any computer, there is no security. In addition, the old rule of thumb was physical access means all access. This is generally true to this day.</p>

		<p>Just the other day I was thinking if it&#39;s less secure for a service to have its event log message format strings stored as resource for easier localization, or hardcoded in the code. I was saying to myself, well, if it&#39;s resource, then it&#39;s also easier for people to mess up and create buffer overflows; putting the format strings in the code at least saves some LoadString calls and keeps away those less determined. Several seconds later I concluded that it&#39;s free game to those who can modify the binary and forgot about it.</p>

		<p>@EricF: An awful lot of cross-platform software misbehaves like that only on Windows because the port framework is an old version that assumes Windows 9x rules. There&#39;s another one in particular that is doing that because it really wants to be setgid but can&#39;t be.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m pretty sure you can still tell Office to install itself into a different folder (and really anything else isn&#39;t especially user-friendly) so I hope they don&#39;t rely on the implicit protection by Program Files but also make sure that the permissions are correctly set when installing anywhere else.</p>

		<p>There is a program that I use that *still* insist on having world-writable shared data in their application directory! I&#39;ve mitigated the solution as much as I can for them by only giving the directories that need to be writable that access, but it&#39;s still a pain; how long has Windows had an &quot;All Users&quot; directory for? (This program in question is cross-platform, but still the issue remains: how many admins have their /usr and /opt directories world-writable?)</p>

		<p>@Evan: It probably wouldn&#39;t work as well as the Unix version because of the way that Windows handles files in use. Unix will generally allow you to delete in-use files, whereas Windows won&#39;t. Yes, I have been bitten by this when I accidentally deleted &quot;busybox&quot; while in recovery mode on a Unix box; what fun I had trying to get that system running again!</p>

		<p>I&#39;m a bit confused regarding the recommended place to install DLLs. The guidelines article (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997548.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/ms997548.aspx</a>) suggests creating a System folder under the application folder and then adding it to the App Paths registry key. However, the DLL search order article (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682586(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/ms682586(v=vs.85).aspx</a>) says that Apps Path is not used when computing the DLL search path. So, should we ignore the guidelines and put all DLLs under the application folder?</p>

		<p>@RicarDog: it is preferable not to use the DLL search order at all. &nbsp;Instead, look up your entry in the App Paths registry key and use it to constuct the full path to the DLL. &nbsp;You can then load the DLL with an explicit path.</p>

		<p>@JJJ: &quot;All you have to do to get administrator access is click &#39;Yes&#39; on a UAC dialog. &nbsp;Surely that MUST be a security hole because really, what kind of attacker would click &quot;no&quot;?&quot;</p>
<p>If you&#39;re serious, you&#39;re confusing a malicious user with a malicious program. 99% of the time it&#39;s the latter that&#39;s the problem, not the former. (For the same reason, &quot;physical access is game over&quot; is also irrelevant 99% of the time.) The whole point of the secure desktop that the UAC uses is that only the *user* him/herself can respond &#8212; programs can&#39;t emulate clicks. So if someone in OVERSEAS_COUNTRY wants to take over my computer, he&#39;ll need my &quot;consent&quot;.</p>
<p>(Of course, that&#39;s ignoring whether the &quot;make this dialog go away!&quot; reaction really counts as consent. UAC is a small step in the right direction, but only a small step; it&#39;s a VERY difficult problem to solve well.)</p>

		<p>Also reading JJJ&#39;s comment again I think I&#39;m dumb.</p>

		<p>@Harry Johnston: My preferred way to do it is to assemble the app path from my own executable&#39;s path.</p>

		<p>Does this mean I need to make sure there are no rogue dlls in my Downloads folder when running .exe installers?</p>

		<p>@Steve: yes, and also make sure there isn&#39;t a msiexec.exe in your Downloads folder either.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
