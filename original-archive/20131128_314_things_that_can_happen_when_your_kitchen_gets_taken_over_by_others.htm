<p>Today is the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States, one of the the major holidays for family get-togethers. (Another big one is Christmas.) One year, it was our family's turn to host Thanksgiving, and when that happens, it means that the kitchen is overrun by relatives cooking all the dishes and hunting through the cabinets and drawers of an unfamiliar kitchen.</p>
<p> One year, I learned that a pastry blender can be used as a potato masher and that a cheese planer can be used as a pie server. </p>
<p> This is what happens when other people use your kitchen. </p>
<p> It could also mean that my kitchen has too many froofy gadgets. </p>
<p> Nadine Kano, best known to geeks as the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1556158408?tag=tholneth-20"> <i>Developing International Software for Windows 95 and Windows NT</i></a>, also has <a href="http://www.cordonbleuusa.com/news/graddecember2011/en"> a pastry degree from Le Cordon Bleu</a>, graduating at the top of her class. She corrected me: "One can never have too many froofy kitchen gadgets." Nadine has since retired from Microsoft to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Speaker-Update-March-12-2013-156023.S.217759652"> start her own consulting firm and be a pastry chef on the side</a>. </p>
<p> (Actually, the fact that my relatives were using a pastry blender as a potato masher and a cheese planer as a pie server suggests that I don't have <i>enough</i> froofy gadgets. Specifically, I'm missing a potato masher and a pie server.) </p>

		<p>On the other hand, the fact that the potato masher wasn&#39;t a fork and that the pie server (and pastry blender) wasn&#39;t a butter knife suggests that the number of gadgets is larger than it might otherwise have been. Perhaps there is no optimal number.</p>
<p>Though I&#39;m wondering what kinds of pies were being served with the cheese planer such that the pastry blender wasn&#39;t needed for its intended purpose. Or were the pie crusts simply made earlier in the day, so it was available (and already out) for potato mashing?</p>

		<p>using a cheese planer as pie server and pastry blender as potato masher might only show that your family watched too much McGyver.</p>

		<p>Or maybe you do have enough froofy gadgets but one day – and only one day – your demand exceeded capacity and you had to improvise. (Therefore, Ms. Kano simply has more demand.) I can name other possibilities too but this is too vague a situation to give much thought (let alone issue a judgment of any sort) without further investigation (if it is worth it).</p>
<p>Still, the part on pastry blender frightens me. Mashing one potato with it pretty much makes it unusable for anything. That&#39;d be $50 down the drain.</p>

		<p>I had to look up what a &quot;pastry blender&quot; was. Apparently what I had always thought that was some kind of strange potato masher is actually for blending pastry dough, so it&#39;s not a big surprise that other people thought so too.</p>

		<p>Well if there&#39;s one thing I think is worth every single cent when baking, it&#39;s a.. actually I never figured out what the correct term for &quot;Küchenmaschine&quot; would be in English. My dictionary claims &quot;food processor&quot; and wikipedia also links the german article to the english food processor article, but in my experience people in the US use &quot;food processor&quot; for the tool that&#39;s used to grind nuts, which really isn&#39;t the same (also extremely useful though). </p>
<p>So to completely derail this discussion would the natives here call this <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://images.otto.de/asset/mmo/formatz/bosch-kuechenmaschine-styline-mum54420-5861127.jpg">images.otto.de/&#8230;/bosch-kuechenmaschine-styline-mum54420-5861127.jpg</a> a food processor? And if yes how do you call this <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Food_Processor_2.jpg">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/File:Food_Processor_2.jpg</a> thingie? </p>
<p>Took me years to get all the food vocabulary in English right despite living for quite a while in the US, but it turns out anything kitchen related is hard to learn &#8211; probably because it never comes up in school.</p>

		<p>@voo: The latter thing is a &quot;food processor.&quot; The first thing looks like a &quot;stand mixer&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.kitchenaid.com/digitalassets/KSM152PSNK/Standalone_1175X1290.jpg">http://www.kitchenaid.com/&#8230;/Standalone_1175X1290.jpg</a>), but the one you linked to also appears to incorporate food processor and &quot;blender&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.fantes.com/images/1048blenders.jpg">http://www.fantes.com/&#8230;/1048blenders.jpg</a>) functionality.

		<p>@SWB,Chad: Thanks, stand mixer sounds very reasonable. </p>
<p>And yes as SWB notices lots of them do have attachments for being used as a blender or food processor &#8211; it was just the first picture on google and I picked without checking too much.</p>

		<p>My parents have recently taken to using an electric mixer when mashing potatoes. &nbsp;They say they prefer the smoother texture, but it feels like mush to me. I still like the way a hand-masher (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/main/9527/22414/18-square-face-potato-masher.jpg">http://www.webstaurantstore.com/&#8230;/18-square-face-potato-masher.jpg</a>) leaves small chunks of potato (even better if you leave skins on as well).</p>
<p>@Chief: Alton Brown came to my mind as well :)</p>

		<p>Nicholas: Depending on the quantity of potatoes, my wife will use an electric mixer (probably the only thing we use it for). I don&#39;t think I can tell the difference, so your parents may be using the wrong mixing duration, speed, or beaters.</p>
<p>Also, we leave the skins on (and use relatively small potatoes so there a given volume will have more skin).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
