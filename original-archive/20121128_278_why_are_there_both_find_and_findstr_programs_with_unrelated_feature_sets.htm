<p>Jonathan wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/08/25/10200026.aspx#10200433"> why we have both <code>find</code> and <code>findstr</code></a>, and furthermore, why the two programs have unrelated features. The <code>find</code> program supports UTF-16, which <code>findstr</code> doesn't; on the other hand, the <code>findstr</code> program supports regular expressions, which <code>find</code> does not.</p>
<p> The reason why their feature sets are unrelated is that the two programs are unrelated. </p>
<p> The <code>find</code> program came first. As I noted in the article, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/08/25/10200026.aspx"> the <code>find</code> program dates back to 1982</a>. When it was ported to Windows&nbsp;NT, Unicode support was added. But nobody bothered to add any features to it. It was intended to be a straight port of the old MS-DOS program. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, one of my colleagues over on the MS-DOS team missed having a <code>grep</code> program, so he wrote his own. Developers often write these little tools to make their lives easier. This was purely a side project, not an official part of any version of MS-DOS or Windows. When he moved to the Windows&nbsp;95 team, he brought his little box of tools with him, and he ported some of them to Win32 in his spare time because, well, that's what programmers do. (This was back in the days when programmers loved to program <i>anything</i> in their spare time.) </p>
<p> And that's where things stood for a long time. The official <code>find</code> program just searched for fixed strings, but could do so in Unicode. Meanwhile, my colleague's little side project supported regular expressions but not Unicode. </p>
<p> And then one day, the Windows 2000 Resource Kit team said, "Hey, that's a pretty cool program you've got there. Mind if we include it in the Resource Kit?" </p>
<p> "Sure, why not," my colleague replied. "It's useful to me, maybe it'll be useful to somebody else." </p>
<p> So <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=17657"> in it went</a>, under the name <code>qgrep</code>. </p>
<p> Next, the Windows Resource Kit folks said, "You know, it's kind of annoying that you have to go install the Resource Kit just to get these useful tools. Wouldn't it be great if we put the most useful ones in the core Windows product?" I don't know what sort of cajoling was necessary, but they convinced the Windows team to add a handful of Resource Kit programs to Windows. Along the way, <code>qgrep</code> somehow changed its name to <code>findstr</code>. (Other Resource Kit programs kept their names, like <code>where</code> and <code>diskraid</code>.) </p>
<p> So there you have it. You can think of the <code>find</code> and <code>findstr</code> programs as examples of parallel evolution. </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, I suppose we cannot know for sure that he is the one who gave it 1 star &#8212; perhaps 10 people give it one star and he gives it 5. &nbsp;However we can see that he regularly rates the blog posts right after they are created.</p>

		<p>@SimonRev, xpclient&#39;s rating history strongly correlates him with the 1 star rating that appear by about 10 minutes after each new post. When you see it happen for yourself, it&#39;s hard not to notice. It&#39;s a very, very strong hint, and one that I think xpclient is not really ashamed of being suspect.</p>
<p>Even though I&#39;m a John Doe, I find it stupid, and I can&#39;t rate. I guess Raymond is kind of immune to trolls, as you can witness at Stack Overflow.</p>

		<p>As an aside, it is an annoyance these commands which have the same name on Unix and Win32 but do different things. It causes potential confusion when using ported versions of the Unix utilities on Windows as part of the build system for portable software.</p>

		<p>Windows really needs an xargs equivalent. &nbsp;for /f %d in (<code>...</code>) is close but not quite the same.</p>
<p>I&#39;m with Cesar: I work in a multi-platform environment, and the existence of incompatible utilities of the same name is a problem. &nbsp;find is the worst offender, being completely unrelated.</p>

		<p>@JM: &quot;I&#39;ve always hated &quot;find&quot;, though. It can do anything, but I can never remember the syntax.&quot;</p>
<p>POSIX &#39;find&#39; is an abomination upon computing. :-)</p>
<p>In my spare time I&#39;m very slowly trying to build up a set of replacement utilities for the normal POSIX stuff, and inspired a little by PowerShell (though I&#39;m not really looking at what it does specifically, I&#39;m using the idea of piping pseudo-objects around and I have something that displays tables like what you get in PS). I do not see a place for a &#39;find&#39; equivalent.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: Are you sure findstr was originally shipped as part of the Win2K Resource Kit? I seem to remember it being shipped with the NT 3.1 retail product. I can&#39;t find anything online to confirm this, but I *did* find a mention of the NT 3.5 findstr: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/135606?wa=wsignin1.0" rel="nofollow">support.microsoft.com/&#8230;/135606</a> If true, this means findstr definitely predates Windows 95 and the Win2K RK.</p>

		<p>Ah, yes, findstr and its plethora of problems and fun :D. One of the top answerers for batch files on Stack Overflow took the time of piecing together all sorts of undocumented things, limitations and shortcomings of findstr: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8844873/73070" rel="nofollow">stackoverflow.com/&#8230;/73070</a></p>
<p>And indeed, PowerShell is probably the reason why there is little need of building better batch file tools. Although I rarely found the need of using Select-String. (Get-Content foo) -match &#39;&#8230;&#39; works just as well and I don&#39;t have to remember the arguments to Select-String ;-)</p>

		<p>Both FIND and FINDSTR have fallen by the wayside for me in favor of PowerShell&#39;s Select-String, mostly because PowerShell has advanced wildcard matching for files built-in (&quot;c:here**.log&quot;) which obviates the need for weird &quot;for /f&quot; incantations.</p>
<p>grep is of course still a perennial favorite on Unix. I&#39;ve always hated &quot;find&quot;, though. It can do anything, but I can never remember the syntax.</p>

<p>Ahh, but correlation does not imply causation.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m rather confused. While the QGREP program is part of the reskit, and FINDSTR does describe itself as QGREP in its manifest, FINDSTR shipped with NT 3.x (I remember using it on NT 3.51).</p>
<p>So does anybody know the real story?</p>

		<p>Of course, nobody wonders why find was written (for Windows) in the first place, since grep dates to 1973, almost 10 years earlier, and is vastly superior. &nbsp;And, yes, the source was available.</p>

		<p>I think Smitty was asking why FIND was written for MS-DOS, since grep predates MS-DOS.</p>
<p>The question could perhaps be generalized as, why didn&#39;t MS-DOS imitate UNIX?</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t remember when FINDSTR became an official part of Windows, but my recollection was that at some point after Windows 2000, a decision was made not to ship RK tools anymore. &nbsp;Tools either had to find sponsorship and support in Windows proper, or die. &nbsp;I knew this because they contacted me about the Clear Screen Saver, which I had contributed to the Win2K RK. &nbsp;It died.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
