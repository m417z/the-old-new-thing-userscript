<p>
We saw some time ago that
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031201-00/?p=41673">
the <code>Get&shy;Window&shy;Long&shy;Ptr</code>
function returns a magic cookie if it needs to thunk the message</a>.
The <code>Call&shy;Window&shy;Proc</code> function
understands this magic cookie and calls the original window procedure
after converting the message to the appropriate character set.
But what if you want to get the actual window procedure and not a thunk?
(For example, because you're writing some debugging or diagnostic code,
and you want to log the actual window procedure address.)
</p>
<p>
The system returns a thunk if you call
<code>Get&shy;Window&shy;Long&shy;PtrA</code>
but the window procedure expects Unicode messages,
or if you call
<code>Get&shy;Window&shy;Long&shy;PtrW</code>
but the window procedure expects ANSI messages.
So you can avoid the character set thunk by checking
the character set of the top-level window procedure
by calling <code>Is&shy;Window&shy;Unicode</code>.
If it reports that the top-level window procedure is Unicode,
then use
<code>Get&shy;Window&shy;Long&shy;PtrW</code>.
Otherwise, use
<code>Get&shy;Window&shy;Long&shy;PtrA</code>.
</p>

This blog has been running for 15 years now.
Sorry I didn't celebrate with some super-fascinating topic.</p>

		<p>I believe that when <code>GetWindowLongPtr</code> returns a cookie instead of the actual procedure address is an implementation detail, is it? (I&#8217;m suggesting you emphasize this so that less people coming across this blog entry base the correctness of their application on it.)</p>

		<p>I looked through the archives and saw the Danish stuff; funny enough, I was in Norway and Denmark this past winter, and now I know what you mean; I was introduced to the &#8220;Kamelåså&#8221; video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-mOy8VUEBk" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-mOy8VUEBk</a>), which you actually linked to in the mid-2018 clearance, and was presumably referenced in the last comment here: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031228-00/?p=41313" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031228-00/?p=41313</a> (I didn&#8217;t realize how old it was!); I also could not comprehend or pronounce that so-called &#8220;d&#8221; when I was there.  </p>
<p>I explained the bizarre numbering system to a friend and showed him the video, and we happened to see some Scandinavian-looking folk a few days later while hiking, and loudly mumbled &#8220;ah, kamelåså&#8221; to each other; we were taken by surprise when they came up to us and said, &#8220;so how did you learn Danish?&#8221; (they were Norwegian)</p>

		<p>Say, how about writing something about whether something is cooking on GUI support of WSL? I think the WSL folks would eventally want to find way to allow GUI applications for *nix to run under Windows.</p>
<p>In X, the program is disconnected from the windows it created (you can have your program run on a server with display sent to X server on another machine) How would that be under Windows? I suppose the shell should be able to connect the window and its underlying process so it can perform task switching or closing window correctly. I&#8217;m very curious on how Microsoft would implement that.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s happening, please share when you can talk about that.</p>

		<p>The event-driven nature of X is pretty different from Windows.  I&#8217;m not sure if you could make it work without running an X server.</p>
<p>As it happens, if you run an X server (like Ximg), you can run X gui programs with WSL.  I&#8217;ve tried several things, like xeyes, xemacs, xscreensaver, and a browser (IIRC, Firefox) and they all worked.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
