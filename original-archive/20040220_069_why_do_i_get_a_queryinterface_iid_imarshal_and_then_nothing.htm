<p>A common problem when trying to get your new COM object off  the ground is that you can't seem to be able to get it created.  The object comes out of the class factory, and it gets a  QueryInterface for IMarshal, and then nothing.  What's going on?</p>
<p>  This is a sure sign that you didn't register your CLSID properly;  most likely you forgot to set your threading model properly.  (And if you fail to specify a threading model at all, then  you get the dreaded "main" threading model.)  </p>
<p>  If somebody tries to create a COM object from a thread whose  model is incompatible with the threading model of the  COM object, then a whole bunch of marshalling stuff kicks in.  And if the marshalling stuff isn't there, then COM can't use your  object.  </p>
<p>  There is  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/techresources/appserv/COM/DCOM/5_ConcurrencyMgmt.asp">  a long and very technical article in MSDN on COM threading models</a>  which has lots of scary-looking diagrams and tables.  In particular, the second scary table in the  "In-process servers: (almost) totally dependent on their clients"  chapter lists all the combinations of thread models with object  threading models, and what COM tries to do in each case.  </p>
<p>  In particular, notice that if you have a (mistakenly marked) "main"-threaded  object and somebody on any thread other than the main thread  tries to create it, marshalling will try to kick in.  </p>
<p>  So watch those threading models.  The failure modes when you get them wrong are quite baffling.</p>

		<p>I have a question I have always wondered about.  Say you have several objects that all aggregate the free threaded marshaler (and of course abide by the rules of doing so&#8230;no non free threded object references being held and whatnot).  Is there any benefit to making the class object for those objects also aggregate the free threaded marshaler?  Is this even safe (don&#8217;t see why it wouldn&#8217;t be on first inspection)?</p>

		<p>Sorry, I&#8217;m not an expert on COM marshalling. Maybe there&#8217;s a COM blogger you can ask.</p>

		<p>I always had the impression that you had to implement IMarshal only if you wanted to use your own custom marshaling. If you didn&#8217;t respond to a QI for IMarshal, you would get the default marshaling from COM (using the type library, for instance).</p>

		<p>This assumes that the interface COM is trying to marshal has a registered type library in the first place.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately COM is so 2001 and your the only guy I know of that has even mentioned an IID in the past couple weeks.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
