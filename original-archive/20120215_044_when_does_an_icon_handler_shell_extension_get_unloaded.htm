<p>A customer had a question about the <code>SHGet&shy;File&shy;Info</code> function. They used the function to obtain the icon for a file, and they discovered that when they asked for the icon of a particular type of file, the shell extension for the associated application was loaded.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> But unfortunately the third party shell extension is not getting unloaded, maybe because of a bug. Can we do anything in code to get this shell extension to unload? </p>

<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/28/167800.aspx"> You already know everything you need to answer this</a>. </p>
<p> Shell extensions are COM objects, and icon handlers are in-process local servers, and in-process local servers remain loaded until the apartment is torn down or the application calls <code>Co&shy;Free&shy;Unused&shy;Libraries</code> (or a moral equivalent). </p>
<p> Therefore, their application can follow the standard COM pattern of calling <code>Co&shy;Free&shy;Unused&shy;Libraries</code> every so often (say, after being idle for five minutes or when there is some indication that the user has stopped one task and started another). The shell extension will then be asked whether it is safe to unload, and if it responds in the affirmative, then COM will unload it. </p>

		<p>Expanding on this, do icons created from resources depend on the underlying resource, or can the DLL be freely unloaded without damaging the icon object?</p>

		<p>@Medinoc: Good question. The documentation for LoadImage doesn&#39;t cover this, and I&#39;d be interested to hear the answer.</p>

		<p>@Medinoc: I&#39;m guessing this depends on if you are using the LR_SHARED flag (&quot;Do not use LR_SHARED for images that have non-standard sizes, that may change after loading, or that are loaded from a file.&quot;). For file extensions, the shell icon cache probably also comes into play&#8230;</p>

		<p>The fact that the documentation calls out that you need to call DestroyIcon, then I would guess that LoadImage makes a copy of the Icon. There is also:</p>
<p>&quot;The system automatically deletes these resources when the process that created them terminates; however, calling the appropriate function saves memory and decreases the size of the process&#39;s working set.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of LoadImage, so I would guess that it makes a copy. But it is still questionable if it is a good idea to unload the DLL even then.</p>

		<p>There&#39;s the possibility that the icon object that you need to destroy only contains pointers to the data, no?</p>
<p>It&#39;s probably not what happens, but even if it isn&#39;t, it isn&#39;t in the documentation (though it should be) so you can&#39;t rely on it. Or maybe loading an icon from a DLL could cause the reference count of the DLL to increase&#8230;</p>
<p>There are many possible implementations of that function, all of which have side effects which can be important to know.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
