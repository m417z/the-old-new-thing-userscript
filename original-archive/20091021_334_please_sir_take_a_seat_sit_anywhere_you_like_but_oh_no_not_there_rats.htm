<p>Here's a joke:</p>
<p> Question: Where does Bill Gates sit? </p>
<p> Answer: Anywhere he wants. </p>
<p> (Naturally, substitute the chairman of your company for Bill Gates.) </p>
<p> I was told this story by a manager who was preparing a demo for Bill Gates. Bill was going to pay a visit to the offices of one particular project which was still under development and be taken on a tour, stopping by offices to see how things are going and get demos of different parts of the project. This manager was in charge of one of the features and naturally was called upon to prepare a little demo. </p>
<p> Chance favors the prepared, and our manager took great care to make sure the demo would go off without a hitch. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  Before Bill came, I spent some time figuring out the agenda and wrote a list of bullet points on a notepad. I 'cleaned' my desk and left the notepad on the desk to my right so I easily take a quick peek if needed. Ran the demos a couple of times to make sure they were still working. Everything was ready. </p>
<p> A few hours later, it was demo time. Bill came to my office, and after some introductions, he decided to sit down. </p>
<p> At my desk. </p>
<p> On my right. </p>
<p> Right on top of my notepad. </p>
<p> I screamed inside my head. This is the sort of thing that happens only in the movies. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Fortunately, the demo went well and there was no need to consult the notepad. </p>
<p> But still. </p>

		<p>That is quite improbable.</p>
<p>Knowing how smart and wily BillG is reputed to be, it&#8217;s possible he could have sat on the notepad on purpose just to see how prepared the manager was.</p>
<p>Is that more or less likely than accidentally happening to sit on the only thing on an otherwise empty desk?</p>

		<p>Or even &quot;Excuse me sir, I may need to refer to that notepad.&quot; &nbsp;I refuse to believe that billg is such a tyrant that such a polite request would result in anything other than politeness in return.</p>

		<p>I would like to think I&#8217;d have no problem making such a polite request. &nbsp; But I&#8217;m fairly certain giving such a presentation to such an audience qualifies as an extremely high-stressful situation &#8212; one might not be thinking as clearly and objectively as we all are right now.</p>

		<p>He should have pre-designated a seat for Mr Gates, saying that you will be able to best see the demo from this location. This would have prevented this difficulty.</p>

		<p>Why would he have needed to sit down? &nbsp;Isn&#8217;t Bill just carried round the Microsoft campus on a sedan chair by ex-Microsoft Works developers?</p>

		<p>Statistically speaking, most people&#8217;s butts are cleaner than their hands &#8211; and their faces. &nbsp;I&#8217;d rather somebody park their butt on my desk than their hands on my mouse, keyboard, or screen.</p>

		<p>@Karellen</p>
<p>I read a post by a former manager at Microsoft where the manager was recounting a his giving a presentation on Excel&#8217;s development to Bill Gates. &nbsp;Prior to the presentation, he&#8217;d sent a massive stack of documentation, but hadn&#8217;t expected it really to be read. &nbsp;It was. &nbsp;And it was newly annotated. &nbsp;And the manager was asked a question on an obscure point (date conversions, IIRC) to test the manager&#8217;s familiarity with his project.</p>
<p>(And I&#8217;m beginning too many sentences with &quot;And&quot;)</p>
<p>So I think you&#8217;re right on the money there; That was the first thing that popped into my head, too.</p>

		<p>Even worse when the date is in the announced name of the product and it slips beyond that year.</p>
<p>Can also be funny, though, like the &quot;C++0x &#8230;we never said it wasn&#8217;t a hexadecimal year!&quot; :-D</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
