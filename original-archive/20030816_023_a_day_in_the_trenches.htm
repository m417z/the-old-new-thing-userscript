<p>         I got up at 5 this morning to spend the day at Product Support Services answering         phones: today was the day the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/16/1060936101810.html">Blaster         worm</a> launched its second wave. And by a startling coincidence, the person at the         station next to me was <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/03/TalkingTo/">Michael         Howard</a> our Senior Security Program Manager and author of <i><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/books/5612.asp">Writing         Secure Code</a></i>. Getting Michael Howard to help you secure your computer is like         getting Lance Armstrong to help you change a flat tire on your bicycle.      </p>
<p>     As enlightening yet humbling experiences go, for a software designer, it's hard to     top (1)&nbsp;watching a usability session, and (2)&nbsp;answering product support     calls. You get to observe users -- customers, the people your job it is to make more     productive -- struggle with the software you helped create.  </p>
<p>         Usability sessions are particularly frustrating since you are hidden behind a one-way         mirror, watching somebody struggle to accomplish something you designed to be the         most obvious thing on the planet. It's a hard lesson to learn: Not everybody is a         geek like you. (Watching a usability session is a lot like being a member of the studio         audience at The Price Is Right trying to help the contestant on stage guess the price         of a new car.)      </p>
<p>     Product support calls let you participate in the other end of the pipeline. The software     is written, it's out there, and now you have to pay for all your mistakes and bad     designs when people call in with their problems. It's software karma.  </body></p>

		<p>I really enjoyed this blog; very informative.</p>
<p>Could you expand on the topic of &quot;usability sessions&quot;. What type of users do you invite and how many? What is the structure of the sessions, i.e. what are the users expected to do? Do you invite the same users back after you make changes based on what happened during the sessions?</p>

		<p>Just guessing here, but maybe <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/usability/" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/usability/</a> will give you some answers to your questions about usability sessions.</p>
<p>NB! I&#8217;m just guessing here, since I don&#8217;t know if this really is what Raymond Chen is doing :)</p>

		<p>I hafe a ?, if you were to blurt &quot;Linux rules all!&quot; one day at work, would you be fired?<br />
:)<br />
It&#8217;s prolly aboot the equivalent of going to a security conferance and screaming &quot;Windows is secure!&quot;<br />
hehe j/k<br />
In any case the worm is a major issue..<br />
I&#8217;m surprised people even released &#8216;auto-hacker/auto-r00ters&#8217; for the vuln.<br />
but in any case, bye</p>

		<p>No I wouldn&#8217;t be fired.  In fact, people might even expect it of me.  I&#8217;ve had a linux box running in my office for years.  Read the linux CREDITS file.</p>
<p>(Thanks, Andreas for the link to the Microsoft usability site.  I should&#8217;ve linked to it myself.  Someday I&#8217;ll write stories &quot;from the trenches of a usability session&quot; to give a better idea of what it&#8217;s like.)</p>

		<p>I love your Lance line so much I&#8217;d like to use it as a quote in a piece I&#8217;m writing. If the other email I have for you isn&#8217;t correct, could you possibly take a moment to let me know on this one if I may use it? Happy to explain the piece. trim the nospam from the email to make it work, she said in paranoia ;-)<br />
Excellent blog BTW</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
