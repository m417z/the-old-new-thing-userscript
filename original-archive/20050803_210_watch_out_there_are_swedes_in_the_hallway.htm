<p>Whenever I go to <a href="http://www.ikea.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/IkeaNearYouView?storeId=12&amp;StoreName=seattle"> IKEA Seattle</a>, I try to speak Swedish with the people who work there, but it never works.</p>
<p> Yesterday, I was heading to a colleague's office to drop off <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/symphony/buy/series/detail.aspx?id=89"> Symphony tickets</a>. (A group of friends wanted tickets together, so the order was placed in my name, and I needed to distribute them to the people in the group.) As I neared his office, I noticed a crowd of people outside and realized that they were speaking Swedish. I tried to follow what they were saying, but of course since they were speaking among themselves, they weren't taking very much effort to enunciate clearly enough for a beginner to follow. </p>
<p> The solution, therefore, is to change the subject. </p>
<p> I said hello and told them I had been studying Swedish for two years. One of them asked me a question that I couldn't understand, so I apologized for my bad Swedish, but they insisted it was "j&auml;ttebra" (great). How they could conclude that from one misunderstood question I'm not sure. They asked me simpler questions like whether I had ever lived in Sweden (no), and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/12/130455.aspx"> why I started studying it in the first place</a>. </p>
<p> After a brief chat, I excused myself to deliver the tickets. Afterwards, I realized that I forgot to ask them whether they were Microsoft employees or whether they were visiting (and if visiting, from what company). </p>

		<p>I always run into fellow swedes at IKEA. One of my pastimes during college was to &quot;test sit&quot; one of their chairs and try and guess which people passing by were Swedes by looks alone.</p>

		<p>Heja, heja, friskt hum&#246;r!<br />
<br />Det &#228;r det som susen g&#246;r!</p>
<p>My guess is that Swedish will be a dying language in 100 years or so. The English language is invading us.</p>

		<p>Odd, everyone at the IKEA here speaks Swedish&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh wait! I live *in* Sweden :)</p>
<p>Jokes aside, I actually have an IKEA Seattle tote bag at home.</p>

		<p>Better to be embraced by English (which will be happy to add your favourite hundred or so words to its vocabulary in the process) than to overrun by French, or obliged to put up with Chinese (aieee Swedish dialect of Chinese, we so don&#8217;t need that)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to contrast the enthusiasm of some people for their native language being replaced by an English dialect, to the desire among some British people to re-invigorate or in some cases outright invent ancient regional languages.</p>
<p>What possible use are Welsh signposts? Or Gaelic translations of government information leaflets? And how did my taxes come to be funding a school that teaches children Cornish ? Is this perhaps an obscure type of art funding? A new piece entitled &quot;A village full of children who&#8217;ve been taught made-up nonsense as a second language&quot; perhaps.</p>
<p>Sure, we were taught Latin at school, and optionally Greek (in my case with little success) but it wasn&#8217;t a primary school, and if you studied hard it enabled you to properly understand the graffiti scene in Life of Brian, whereas I&#8217;ve yet to see a movie with a good Cornish joke in it.</p>

		<p>I took Swedish for about two years, but found the lack of Swedes in America made it hard to practice, so I finally have lost my fluency. I can pick up bits and pieces here and there, but nothing like I used to. GOOD LUCK and keep it up! =)</p>

		<p>&quot;why I started studying it in the first place&quot; (link)</p>
<p>Grrr&#8230;I&#8217;ve never been sure what the point of that post was in the first place.  That&#8217;s great that you know some Swedish, but 99% of your readers probably don&#8217;t.  So what&#8217;s the point of excluding them?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
