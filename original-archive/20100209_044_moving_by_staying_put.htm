<p>A few years ago, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/"> Michael Kaplan</a> opined on his distaste for office moves, particular the ones for which <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/10/02/5233452.aspx"> there appears to be very little benefit</a>. One of his options was "interview with whatever group moves into Building 24 and work for them instead."</p>
<p> Many years ago, an organizational change to the project I was working on resulted in my group ceasing to exist. The reason isn't important to the story; what's important is that the members of that group were redeployed to other parts of the project. At the time, I hadn't yet learned that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/11/491780.aspx"> material goods are a burden</a>, and I dreaded moving offices because of all the packing and unpacking I would have to do. </p>
<p> Solution: Join whatever group was moving into my hallway on the condition that I get to keep my office. </p>
<p> They gladly accepted the terms of this agreement. </p>

		<p>Possibly I&#8217;m taking this more literally than intended, but I&#8217;m puzzled by the notion of caring so little about what one does that one would &#8216;join whatever group&#8230;&#8217;</p>
<p>My own career has been somewhat haphazard, but never quite as random as that.</p>

		<p>I asked a friend and classmate that works at MSFT if he ever met you. His response was that &quot;yeah, we moved into his building and he joined our team.&quot; Which led to an interesting discussion, now relayed in your post.. heh.</p>

		<p>Reading Michael&#8217;s blog post, it seems he would prefer not to move for medical reasons. &nbsp;Sounds fair enough to me. &nbsp;However, in the absense of that, it really is good to be close to the people you work with. &nbsp;I&#8217;d bet there&#8217;s a substantial loss of productivity from having offices far apart, and that can probably be measured.</p>

		<p>Haha! Maybe, certain groups are using this technique to get the employees they want for their group. Like they know another group gets disbanded/moved/whatever and apply to move into that building instead in hope a certain employee will like his office so much that he would apply for the new group under the condition to keep that particular office. :D</p>

		<p>I quite like this way of thinking.</p>
<p>That way after 20 years when you introduce youself to a new colleagu: &quot;Hi I&#8217;m Bob, I started in QA in the 70&#8217;s and then moved onto the UI team in &#8217;79 and then moved to the Shell team in &#8217;85 and then back to the QA team in &#8217;94 and blah blah blah&quot; you can just say</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m Raymond.I work in Building 6&quot; (or wherever) ;)</p>

		<p>Since Raymond obviously is a HERO to many people (he is to me), it would be more cool to say: &quot;I&#8217;m Raymond. I work in building 26&quot; ;-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
