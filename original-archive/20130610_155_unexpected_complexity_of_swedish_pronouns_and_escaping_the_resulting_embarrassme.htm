		<p>@Mason: I assume that&#39;s (vaguely) Swedish but since I don&#39;t speak the language I used google translate, which informed me that it is in fact Afrikaans for &quot;Endis vurn, nan of trade Nighty buts, scorn of sleepy det conditions hur wakey-oopen! Bork! Bork! Bork!&quot;.</p>
<p>Now I want to know what the trade in Nighty buts is all about, and why my grandmother Endis (who plies this trade, though she never said anything about it to me) is so down on sleepy det conditions.</p>

		<p>Ken Hagan,</p>
<p>No, it is not at all Swedish. I am Norwegian myself, but Swedish is closer to (standard) Norwegian than some Norwegian dialects are. I don&#39;t recognize a single word as meaningful Swedish (except by accident &#8211; e.g. &quot;hur&quot; is a Swedish word, but it makes no sense whatsoever in the sentence. no matter what the other words are. (&quot;Hur&quot; is a questioning &quot;How?&quot;)</p>

		<p>Clearly that is fake language that is designed to actually be comprehensible to an english speaking person, hence the nighty-maren for nightmares, sleepy-det for sleep debt and wakey-oopen for waking up.</p>

		<p>Sounds a bit like the fake Swedish in the 1968 parody &quot;De DÃ¼va&quot; (Madeline Kahn&#39;s first film), which included such choice translations as &quot;zooner-or-later-ska&quot; for &quot;eventually&quot;, and &quot;aitch-too-oh-ska&quot; for &quot;water&quot;.</p>

		<p>Ken (and those who responded to him), I highly suggest searching for &quot;Bork! Bork! Bork!&quot; on your favorite search engine.</p>

		<p>Czech language is in halfway to your dream. Pronoun &quot;oni&quot; means simply &quot;they&quot;, eg. gender-neutral. But if the group you are talking about consists only of feminine-gender things (for example girls, chairs, mountains, etc.) , you can say &quot;ony&quot;. It&#39;s not used very much in common everyday speaking and sounds maybe little bit archaic, but it&#39;s possible. Unfortunately there isn&#39;t any special pronoun for group of masculine-gender things :-(</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
