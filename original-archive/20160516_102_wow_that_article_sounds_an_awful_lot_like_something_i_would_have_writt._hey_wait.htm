A customer (via their customer liaison) had a question about the meaning
of the lock overlay icon.
Another colleague responded with
<a HREF="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/the-overlay-icons-in-windows-7"
   REL="nofollow">
a link to a site that contained an explanation</a>.
</p>
<p>
I read the linked article and thought to myself,
"Wow, that article sounds an awful lot like something I would have written."
The style of the writing is similar to mine,
and the phrases
"Given the changes in how people use computers",
"visual clutter",
and "the value ... diminishes"
particularly struck me.
</p>
<p>
And it turns out the reason it sounded so familiar was that
in fact
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20091209-00/?p=15723">
was something I had written</a>.
I wrote my article in 2009, and the plagiarized article came out in 2010.
</p>
<p>
My colleague apologized.
"I realized that I should have searched your blog first.
The link I posted was the leading search result on both Bing and Google."
</p>
<p>
Great.
My original content loses to the site that scrapes my content.
I must be doing this wrong.
</p>
<p>
(This was before they migrated the blog to the new server,
so don't blame the migration for the poor search ranking.)</p>

		<p>The RSS comments feed has been broken for all your articles since the blog software changed.  If you could notify the people that do manage the blog software, I would appreciate it.  For example, the comments feed for this post is listed as &#8220;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160516-00/?p=93465/feed&#8221; in the HTML source, but it does not work.</p>

		<p>I am often surprised by people sharing links to re-published articles. In many cases, the copy carries an obligatory &#8220;originally posted at <a href="http://blogs.contoso.com" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.contoso.com</a>&#8221; &#8211; but those who distribute the link seem not to be aware that the author deserves the href (and the ad impressions)  more than the shameless aggregator</p>

		<p>A couple years ago, I was getting a odd run-time error, so I naturally googled it, and found a question of StackOver from a few years earlier by someone with the same problem.</p>
<p>The accepted (and correct) solution had been written by me.</p>
<p>(The root cause of his problem was a bit more obvious, so I hadn&#8217;t needed to unhelpful error message to diagnose it then.  Now able to see what the error message was trying to say, I was able to fix my own problem)</p>

		<p>Funny that I come across another question on those &#8220;copying from MSDN websites&#8221; yesterday.</p>
<p><a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/d3ef4727-fee6-4de1-a2af-80c55d23baa9/question-has-been-copied-to-another-site?forum=reportabug" rel="nofollow">https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/d3ef4727-fee6-4de1-a2af-80c55d23baa9/question-has-been-copied-to-another-site?forum=reportabug</a></p>
<p>It is about a forum user want his post in MSDN forum got removed&#8230; only to find out that the original post has been copied out by those sites and he has no way to remove them.</p>
<p>Usually I dislike the idea of removing questions from forum (if you really don&#8217;t want other people know you need to seek help on a problem, find someone who do a paid support. We don&#8217;t spend our time trying to help single people) but I decided to offer some idea because those sites make &#8220;correcting information after a while&#8221; more difficult&#8230; say I would like to include a link to last weeks article yesterday. I could ask forum moderators to help modifiy the posts but have no way to contact those &#8220;copying sites&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Raymond, you think it&#8217;s bad when your blog is quoted as an official Microsoft source? That page finishes with the following line:<br />
&#8220;The following registry key will show you all currently installed overlay handlers, on your Windows computer, states Microsoft.&#8221; The link they give is to your blog entry, and the registry entry is cited there by a commenter. So even commenting on your blog makes one an official Microsoft source these days!</p>

		<p>&gt; I am an MVP</p>
<p>Hopefully not for much longer. If this is &#8220;MVP-like behavior&#8221;, then it cheapens the meaning of the term.</p>
<p>&gt; Everyone steals on the internet</p>
<p>Go read John Gruber&#8217;s &#8220;On Attribution and Credit&#8221; from 2011. Among his salient points:</p>
<p>&gt; You get a story from somewhere else, you link to the original when you post about it. That’s the first rule of web attribution. </p>
<p>&gt; Not even including a link to the source of a story is dishonest.</p>
<p>&gt; Why do we put bylines on stories in the first place? Because writers deserve credit, obviously.</p>

		<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was the one who bought this to the authors attention. As someone who has studied at university, I know the importance of attributing original authors where appropriate. If you don&#8217;t do this, then things can get pretty nasty, depending on the people you&#8217;re dealing with.</p>

		<p>Rewriting is fine, especially when you link to the original. You&#8217;re basically saying &#8220;Hey I was reading [this page I&#8217;m linking to] and think the content is helpful but I want to rewrite it in my own voice to share it further.&#8221; Copying and pasting the content and representing it as your own is bad.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not just bad, it opens the site up to a DMCA takedown, or a lawsuit if they have too much scraped content.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;normalization of deviance&#8221;.  Deviance as in being off from accepted results, not in a moral sense.  Look where it got the Challenger&#8230;</p>

		<p>I had a similar experience a couple of months ago  I had a question and started searching.  I found a forum poster who had the  same question, so I scroll down to the answer and started thinking that it sounded very familiar.  About two seconds later I realized that I had written the accepted answer several years back! (In this case it was about technology that I had not used for quite a while but had been something I was actively using back when I wrote the answer)</p>

		<p>The best thing is how it makes you think that guy mentioned below that article wrote it. That&#8217;s really lame.</p>

		<p>Another comment made here under the name &#8216;Anand Khanse&#8217; on May 16th, has NOT been made by me. I have always given credit where it is due. My post includes links too. But since this post was now bought to my notice today, I decided to come here and clarify. Anyway, I have also now additionally mentioned in BOLD that my post has been sourced from here, towards the end of the post.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
