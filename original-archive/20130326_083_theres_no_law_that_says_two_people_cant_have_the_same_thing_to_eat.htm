<p>Some time ago, my group went out for a team lunch. It was to a restaurant we were not familiar with, so there was quite a bit of time studying the menu. As everybody looked over the menu, discussion naturally turned to "So what are you going to have?"</p>
<p> "I think I'll have the salmon sandwich." </p>
<p> One of my colleagues replied, "Oh, rats. I was thinking of having that." </p>
<p> I remarked, "There's no law that says <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/02/05/10391042.aspx"> two people can't order the same thing</a>." </p>
<p> My colleague disagreed. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Not if you ask my wife. Whenever we go out to eat, she'll ask me what I'm having, and then she'll say "Oh, rats. I was thinking of having that. Now I'll have to order something else." </p>
<p> I'll say, "You can order it too, that's okay. Or I'll change my order, no big deal." </p>
<p> But she'll say, "No, that's okay. I'll just find something else." </p>
<p> I've tried many times without success to convince her that it's okay for two people to have the same thing to eat. Now I just accept it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b>Update</b>: A few months later, I received an update from my colleague. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> The other night, my wife and I went out to dinner, and my wife <i>really wanted</i> the same that I had already said that I was going to order. But instead of switching to something else, <i>she ordered it anyway</i>. I think this is the first time this has ever happened. And you know what? The world did not end. </p>

		<p>I must admit, I am often guilty of doing this, as is my wife, and many of my friends. I think it&#39;s because we tend to be adventurous and economically minded people, and if multiple people order the same thing, then you get less variety per dollar. We tend to share food with each other, so everybody getting something different increases variety at a minimal cost. If we are more familiar with the menu, I think that is less likely to happen.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Yup, my wife and I do the same thing. &quot;I&#39;m thinking of getting the X.&quot; &quot;Me too! Why don&#39;t you order the X, and I&#39;ll order the Y, and we&#39;ll share.&quot; That way we get to sample two dishes. (In fact this, is so standard for us that we don&#39;t even explain it. &quot;I&#39;m thinking of getting the X.&quot; &quot;Okay, then I&#39;ll get the Y.&quot; and then when the food comes, we split it up as a matter of course.) -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>My wife used to do the same thing, especially when we went out to eat with my parents. &nbsp;Our solution&#8230; we always made her order first and we wouldn&#39;t tell her what we were going to order. &nbsp;We have since broke her of this habit.</p>

		<p>This came up last week with a friend. He apologized for ordering the same food, I replied it didn&#39;t matter since we weren&#39;t sharing food anyway. That&#39;s the only time where diversified food ordering comes in handy: when you&#39;re sharing (or at least sampling) each other&#39;s entrees.</p>

		<p>I think the other reason that ordering different items comes into play is when you want to see how good the various dishes are at the restaurant. &nbsp;If everyone ordered the same thing then nobody knows what any of the other items taste like.</p>

		<p>At this one particular restaurant, my aunt and uncle would order the same thing as each other, regardless of what everyone else was eating&#8211;and it was a Chinese restaurant! &nbsp;(And nobody ate theirs, and they didn&#39;t eat anyone else&#39;s.)</p>

		<p>The rule when eating Chinese (which, in Australia at least, is usually discrete dishes of the form &quot;[flavour][main ingredient]&quot;, such as Sweet and Sour Pork or Satay Vegetables or whatever) is to order N dishes plus rice for N people at the table, then everyone shares. &nbsp;In that case it would make no sense to order two of the same thing. &nbsp;Although I&#39;ve never considered it, I guess this is the reason we do the same even when the food comes on specific plates and sharing is thus more complicated. &nbsp;The logic is viral, perhaps.</p>

		<p>We ordinarily share bites, but when my wife gets red meat, I always order the same thing at the same doneness to increase the odds that they&#39;ll be cooked properly. &nbsp;Ordering an 8 oz and a 10 oz on the same check practically guarantees that one or the other will be overcooked.</p>

		<p>The book &quot;Predictably Irrational&quot;, by Dan Ariely, has an interesting section on this exact phenomenon. &nbsp;It turns out that the social forces that compel people to choose their second choice, when somebody else has already ordered their first choice, lead people to have a worse dining experience than those that just go ahead and order what they want &#8211; even if the whole table orders the same meal.</p>

		<p>This behavior even if we are zero percent aware of it at conscious level comes from our deep subconscious instincts of survival.</p>
<p>Going for different types of food reduces the risk of poisoning (humans had potentially poisonous foods in their diet for millions of years), going for variety increases the chance of successfully procuring food (humans have pursued multiple types of foods for millions of years).</p>
<p>This urge to pursue food variety if you have the chance comes from subconscious level, but has no rational explanation in today&#39;s world, that&#39;s why our rational brains find it very strange.</p>

<p>Rookie mistake. The correct response is to wait for her to come up with an alternate dish, then say &quot;y&#39;know, that sounds good; I&#39;ll get that too.&quot;</p>
<p>Bonus points if you do this when the server is already at the table.</p>

		<p>In defense of ordering the same thing: cooking time should be the same/similar and less screw ups. I used to hang out with a youth group in college and we&#39;d go out pretty much every week for dinner. Someone always ordered the filet-o-fish or the casual dining equivalent suboptimal prep-time item. Problem: they wanted to say grace before eating but considered it rude to do that before everyone had their food. So I ended up with my ribs in front of me for 10-15 min before I could eat, usually after an evening church service so ~9pm at night and I was HUNGRY :) Boo.</p>
<p>One time where order the same (or close failed): both me and a friend ordered a steak medium. His came and it was charcoal. So they ended up reordering his item and by then they were busy so took about another hour for his food to show up after mine. That sucked too.</p>

		<p>@Eric TF Bat: Depending on the Chinese restaurant and how adventurous the people are feeling, there eventually comes an N where repeating items is probably a better idea for everyone in the party. &nbsp;(Also, I subscribe to the &quot;N+1 dishes, plus rice&quot; principle for N diners, but that&#39;s partly because I normally just go out with my wife, partly because I can eat through 1.xxxx dishes, and partly because I like having leftovers for lunch the next day.)</p>

		<p>If we&#39;re planning on sharing, we always try to get different orders. If we&#39;re not planning to share, we always try to order what sounds the best. Even though I&#39;m the person usually trying to encourage sharing, I consider it a point of pride when somebody changes their order to the same thing I&#39;m getting.</p>

		<p>@Mike</p>
<p>Don&#39;t go to restaurants that cannot handle variable cooking times. They should be plating all items for a table at the same time which means starting the item with the longest cooking time first and starting each item as necessary for it all to reach &quot;done&quot; near simultaneously. (Some items, like pasta and sauce, can wait in a &quot;done&quot; state without affecting quality.)</p>

		<p>My wife and I now adhere to this rule after ordering identical dishes while on our honeymoon. &nbsp;The meal was terrible. &nbsp;We generally won&#39;t send a meal back for tasting bad (only for things like &quot;this is undercooked&quot; or &quot;not what we ordered&quot;), especially when we don&#39;t want to waste time. So we both went a little hungry that night. Now we both order unique dishes so that if one is inedible we can split the second.</p>

		<p>&quot;In that case it would make no sense to order two of the same thing&quot;: It makes sense if one of the dishes is terribly popular, e.g. a dish that the restaurant is known for. &quot;Where do you want to go for lunch?&quot; &quot;Let&#39;s go to ABC, I love their XYZ.&quot; &quot;Oh yes, so do I.&quot;</p>

		<p>I guess we do this some, but not as a rule. Given that most of our dinners out have two persons ordering, occasionally three or four, and that the menu usually has at least eight entrees, the chance of collisions is fairly small anyway.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there&#39;s the scene in the movie Tampopo where the fellow disrupts a business lunch by not ordering what everyone else&#8211;starting with the big boss&#8211;ordered.</p>

		<p>Our wife and I often order different and share. But some places there is 1 dish so perfect we both just order it. When I was working in China I had an Australian colleague who wasn&#39;t used to the popular concept in Asian dishes of order many different dishes and share. I remember at Chinese restaurant the waiter (who couldn&#39;t speak English) kept trying to give him hints &quot;put your dish in center of table, share it&quot; but he just cuddled his dish in a protective embrace :)</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve never heared of this until now. I&#39;m actually happier if people order the same thing because it would be faster to prepare.</p>

		<p>Hah, that&#39;s funny, apparently this also happens across cultures. I have dated (and married, on occasion) Argentinian, Brazilian, German, French and American women and I *always* saw this behavior. I guess dating isn&#39;t really the best example though, as everyone is trying to display as wide a range of likes and dislikes in the process that might somehow skew the results, but even on longer term relationships where there was no need to impress the other this behavior was invariant. Interesting.</p>

		<p>There&#39;s one exception to this: If your friends have ordered some sort of &quot;fried rice&quot;, you shouldn&#39;t order the same.</p>
<p>This is because the cook is known to fry the 2 orders at the same time, but frying 2 serving of rice would be too difficult. Not only the wok would be heavier, the heat would be more difficult to distribute evenly over the rice. And the ingradients and salt would be difficult to distribute evenly too. So the cook will tends to reduce the size of servings.</p>
<p>Net result, each of you have smaller dish of fried rice that when you put them together, it would be around 1.5 dishes only.</p>

		<p>@Eric TF Bat: When it comes to order Chinese dishes, if N = 7, you either order one more dish or one less. That&#39;s because a 7-dishes meal in Chinese has special meaning &#8211; that&#39;s for people who have just attended funeral ceremony. In Chinese traditional thought, people believes ordering dishes like that unless you&#39;re that kind of people brings bad luck to your family.</p>

		<p>Sounds very very familiar. If I know I&#39;m sharing, I&#39;ll order something different. If I&#39;m just with a bunch of mates, we&#39;ll order whatever we feel like and not worry if anyone orders the same.</p>

		<p>I generally just order what I want at a restaurant regardless of what anyone else is having.</p>
<p>This usually doesn&#39;t include an entree (which is what you get before the main course) because the main course is generally enough for me.</p>

		<p>My wife and I do do this occasionally, but we&#39;ve now reached an (unspoken) position where when we go out we&#39;ll often eat something the other person does not like &#8211; since we eat together, this rarely happens at home &#8212; so meals out are an opportunity to indulge in those &quot;forbidden&quot; food stuffs.</p>

		<p>Wow,I am impressed, we both like to eat what we like. And we will regularly order the same things but equaly often different things.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t realise how exceptional this is.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t just for sharing food. My ex-girlfriend would always insist I order something different. That way if she didn&#39;t like hers we would swap dishes. She knew I would eat anything and not care and she was far more picky.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
