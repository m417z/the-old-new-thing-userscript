<p>There are two types of atoms, so-called <i>integer atoms</i>, which are just small integers, and, um, atoms that don't have a special adjective; these plain vanilla atoms come from functions like <code>AddAtom</code>. (For the purpose of this discussion, I'll call them <i>string atoms</i>.) The atom zero is invalid (<code>INVALID_ATOM</code>); atoms 1 through <code>MAXINTATOM-1</code>&dagger; are integer atoms, and atoms from <code>MAXINTATOM</code> through <code>0xFFFF</code> are string atoms. Why is the value of <code>MAXINTATOM</code> <code>0xC000</code>?</p>
<p> The reason has its roots in 16-bit Windows. Atoms are kept in a, well, atom table. The details of the atom table aren't important aside from the fact that the nodes in the atom table are allocated from the heap, and each node corresponds to one string in that atom table. </p>
<p> Since we're working in 16-bit Windows, the pointers in the atom table are 16-bit pointers, and all memory blocks in the 16-bit heap are 4-byte aligned. Alignment on 4-byte boundaries means that the bottom two bits of the address are always zero. Therefore, there are only 14 bits of value in the node pointer. Take that pointer, shift it right two places, and set the top two bits, and there you have your atom. Conversely, to convert an atom back to a node, strip off the top two bits and shift the result left two places. </p>
<p> Why encode the pointer this way? Well, you have 14 bits of information and you want to return a 16-bit value. You have two bits to play with, so your decisions are where to put those bits and what values they should have. It'd be convenient if all the integer atoms were contiguous and all the string were contiguous, to make range checking easier. Now you're down to two options. You have a 49152-value range of integer atoms and a 16384-value range of string atoms. Either you put the integer atoms at the low end (<code>0x0000-0xBFFF</code>) and the string atoms at the high end  (<code>0xC000-0xFFFF</code>), or you put the string atoms at the low end (<code>0x0000-0x3FFF</code>) and the integer atoms at the high end  (<code>0x4000-0xFFFF</code>). You probably don't want zero to be a valid string atom, since that's the most likely value for an uninitialized atom variable, so putting the string atoms at the top of the range wins out. </p>
<p> Now, with the conversion to Win32, the old implementation of atoms was thrown out. Atoms are no longer encoded pointers, but the new implementation still had to adhere to the breakdown of the 16-bit atom space into integer atoms and string atoms. </p>
<p> Over the next few entries, we'll take a look at other consequences of the way string atoms are assigned and surprising things you can do with atoms. (Not necessarily good things, but still surprising.) </p>
<p><b>Footnotes</b></p>
<p> &dagger;The <code>MAXINTATOM</code> symbol adheres to the classic Hungarian convention that "max" is one more than the highest legal value. </p>

		<p>I forgot to mention Win32s. That thunked almost every part of 32-bit User32 and Gdi32 to 16-bit USER and GDI. In some ways, Win9x is a enhanced version of Win32s. Luckily no one claimed Win32s is fully 32-bit and that fact was well-known, thus I don&#8217;t mention it. Win9x is often hyped to be a full 32-bit OS. It is not, as exposed by the Pentium Pro, made by Intel engineers who believed the hype.</p>

		<p>&quot;If only there were some web site you could go to to find the answer to questions like what are windows integer and string atoms?&quot;</p>
<p>Luckily enough &#8216;atom&#8217; is not a generic word used for a gazillion other things. (the first hit is actually this article which isn&#8217;t very helpful). Wikipedia also has a lot of articles about &#8216;atom&#8217;s but not about this particular kind. Furthermore, I tried MSDN but that&#8217;s completely useless.</p>

<p>Atom is a common word. &nbsp;So maybe you need to hone your search slightly.</p>
<p>Try going to a popular search engine, entering &quot;What are windows integer and string atoms&quot; and clicking &quot;I feel lucky&quot;.</p>

<p>Did you even try that before posting ? Because you&#8217;ll end up on THIS page you&#8217;re looking at right now.</p>
<p>Also, the first MSDN hit isn&#8217;t too helpful, it explains what atom tables are used for, not what they are.</p>

		<p>Aaargh: Do you mean this msdn page: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms649053" rel="nofollow">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms649053</a>(VS.85).aspx</p>
<p>? It seems pretty clear to me what atoms are just from reading that page. They allow you to share strings (or integers, obviously) via an opaque integer. Some atoms can be global (shared by all processes) and some a private (available to only one application).</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s your answer. I&#8217;m not sure what you&#8217;re looking for&#8230; also, until a few hours ago, that MSDN page was the first page you hit when you entered Spike&#8217;s query. It&#8217;s now the second hit (this page is the first).</p>

		<p>&quot;They allow you to share strings (or integers, obviously) via an opaque integer. &quot;</p>
<p>This is unclear to me, the MSDN page says &quot;When applications pass null-terminated strings to the GlobalAddAtom, AddAtom, GlobalFindAtom, and FindAtom functions, they receive string atoms (16-bit integers) in return.&quot;</p>
<p>Sounds to me it&#8217;s just a 16 bit integer, but then why call them &#8216;atoms&#8217; , just to make it less transparent and more annoying ? Doesn&#8217;t sound logical to me, it would seem to me that an atom is more than just a 16-bit int, why else give it a confusing name. Furthermore, why is it called an &#8216;atom&#8217;, because the name does not really make sense even when you know what it&#8217;s supposed to do. As far as I can see it&#8217;s just a key in a mapping table, so why not call it a key ?</p>
<p>So again: what is an atom ?</p>

		<p>&quot;Well yes, but you know if you give a man a fish he&#8217;ll have a meal. &nbsp;But if you teach a man to fish&#8230; well then he&#8217;ll have a hobby too.&quot;</p>
<p>You got the quote wrong, it&#8217;s : &quot;Give a man fire, and he&#8217;s warm for a day. Set a man on fire and he&#8217;s warm for the rest of his life.&quot;</p>

		<p>Where, When and Why would an windows application developer ever need to use an Windows ATOM in the first place?</p>
<p>Are Atoms the lowest overhead objects that can be shared by processes?</p>
<p>What gives?</p>

		<p>Cripes, people &#8211; if you want to know about the atoms that Raymond is talking about, Sinan did the heavy lifting and provided a *link* to a document that gives a basic description. &nbsp;That&#8217;s right &#8211; a link. &nbsp;All you have to do is click on it.</p>
<p>Surely, even if it&#8217;s too much to ask to actually use some form of Internet search, you can&#8217;t argue that it&#8217;s to much to ask that you &nbsp;click on a link. &nbsp;After all, how did you get to Raymond&#8217;s blog in the first place?</p>

		<p>I was also confused about the use of &quot;atom&quot; in this context. It is not easy to find information about this because that term is used in many different ways. There are even two others (that I know about) in the field of software (1 &#8211; an &quot;atomic&quot; operation can&#8217;t be interrupted and its result corrupted and 2 &#8211; an API called Atom for RSS feeds). It&#8217;s interesting that a link that was proffered as the definition of &quot;atom&quot; for this context came from a third-party site.</p>
<p>Perhaps, this page:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms648708" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms648708</a>(VS.85).aspx</p>
<p>from the MSDN site itself is more helpful. It was <em>not</em> easy to find. Google and MSDN search are great tools but they don&#8217;t always find the answer you need as quickly as you need it. I am glad to help out with a search when I can. And I&#8217;m glad to know a bit more about the use of &quot;atom&quot; in the Windows 32 API.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

		<p>&quot;So there&#8217;s your answer. I&#8217;m not sure what you&#8217;re looking for&#8230; also, until a few hours ago, that MSDN page was the first page you hit when you entered Spike&#8217;s query. It&#8217;s now the second hit (this page is the first).&quot;</p>
<p>That there&#8217;s the problem with web two-point-oh.</p>
<p>Muddles up all ther search engines.</p>

		<p>I tried splicing an ATOM but all I had left was 2 BYTEs and no bang! Aaaaaaaw :'(</p>
<p>Maybe Windows should get a new api, PlodeEx (to remain consistent), that works faster then the UNIX nuke(8) :)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
