<p> For the same reason that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/03/942851.aspx"> not all error codes are defined in <code>winerror.h</code></a>, not all error strings are defined in the system message table. If you've ever played with the message compiler, you'd quickly have recognized the <code>winerror.h</code> file as the header file associated with a message resource. In other words, there's a <code>.mc</code> file that gets processed by the message compiler, and out pops the message resource (which becomes the system message table) and the <code>winerror.h</code> header file. </p>
<p> As we saw a few years ago, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/03/942851.aspx"> not all error messages live in <code>winerror.h</code></a>, which means that not all error messages live in the system message table. Each component that provides error codes outside of <code>winerror.h</code> needs to provide its own message table. For example, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370285.aspx"> messages for network errors can be found in <code>netmsg.dll</code></a>. Similarly, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/08/462402.aspx#462550"> winhttp error message text can be found in <code>winhttp.dll</code></a>. I don't know about other message ranges; hopefully the documentation for the component that generates those errors also mentions where you can find the text. </p>

		<p>@Koro: not surprising, WinError.h only goes up to 6008 for NT 4.0, but later versions do include WinSock errors.</p>
<p>Windows Sockets has a history of being nearly part of Windows &#8211; the API was defined by Microsoft but for earlier releases, the actual implementation came from other vendors. WinSock 2 was the native API on Windows 98 and NT 4.0 and an installable update was made available for Windows 95. I&#8217;m not sure if earlier versions of Windows NT and Windows 95 installed Microsoft&#8217;s WinSock unless you installed the TCP/IP stack (not installed by default).</p>
<p>By Windows 2000 TCP/IP wasn&#8217;t just installed by default, it was mandatory, so it makes sense that the error messages made it into the system message table.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;d be nice if there were some centralised listing for that sort of thing (at least for MS products). &nbsp;I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of times I&#8217;ve tried to use Error Lookup or a similar tool to try and work out what an obscure HRESULT means and it&#8217;s reported that it has no idea.</p>
<p>(This is more often annoying at the user level, though, where an application blindly reports an HRESULT error code in a message box or similar. &nbsp;I have no idea what components it&#8217;s using under the covers, so I can&#8217;t look at the component-specific docs.)</p>
<p>Of course, Google is often sufficient to that task &#8212; though for some problems it&#8217;s too easy to get drowned in the noise without finding a solution.</p>

<p>I can almost see Korean Windows version &quot;KT&quot; without TCP/IP stack, to allow the poor users get one of their choosing.</p>

		<p>The reason you tend to get error numbers than messages is because of the lack of a nice strerror() type function. Instead you get this monstrosity FormatMessage that takes a zillion parameters, and spits out a result, so to use it you have to allocate a buffer and all that nice stuff. And FormatMessage itself requires arcane arts to make messages for. There&#8217;s probably a great reason for it, but it certainly isn&#8217;t as easy to use as say strerror() or GetLastError().</p>
<p>Even something that returns the short form message would make everyone&#8217;s lives easier&#8230;</p>
<p>Hrm&#8230; a possible opportunity here&#8230; and to make it GPL to mess with people, too.</p>

		<p>Error Code Lookup tool</p>
<p>&quot;Use the Error Code Lookup tool to determine error values from decimal and hexadecimal error codes in Microsoft Windows&#174; operating systems. The tool can look up one or more values at a time. All values on the command line will be looked up in Exchangeâ€™s internal tables and presented to you. If available, informational data associated with the value or values will also be shown.&quot;</p>

<p>Says it&#8217;s for exchange but it used to be part of the psdk &#8211; and still contains error messages for many things; mine says &quot;There are currently 25553 return codes registered from 175 sources.&quot;.</p>

		<p>&quot;The reason you tend to get error numbers than messages is because of the lack of a nice strerror() type function.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, what about the quality of the error messages? I looked at them and at least some of them are too technical for the average user.</p>

		<p>You don&#8217;t need an extra tool.</p>
<p>Just type:</p>
<p>net helpmsg &lt;errornumber&gt;</p>
<p>and you get the formatted error message.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
