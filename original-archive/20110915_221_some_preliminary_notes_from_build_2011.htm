<p>Hey everybody, I'm down at the <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">//build/</a> conference. (The extra slash is to keep the d from falling over.) I'm not speaking this year, but you can find me in the Apps area of the Expo room today until 3:30pm (except lunchtime), and Friday morning before lunch. I'll also be at Ask the Experts tonight.</p>
<p> There are so many great sessions to choose from. The one I would attend if I weren't working that time slot would be <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/events/BUILD/BUILD2011/APP-206T"> Bring apps to life with Metro style animations in HTML5</a>. Instead, I'll probably go to <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/events/BUILD/BUILD2011/APP-162T"> Building high performance Metro style apps using HTML5</a>. Fortunately, the sessions are being recorded, so I can catch up later. </p>
<p> (At PDC 2008, I learned of a class of conference attendee known as the <i>overflow vulture</i>. These people decide which sessions to attend by looking for the ones that are close to filling up, on the theory that "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdEGnAcAlX4">500 people can't be wrong</a>." These people often fail to take into account the room size. A talk in a 200-person room which fills up is not necessarily more popular than a talk in a 500-person room which doesn't.) </p>
<p> Here are my observations so far: </p>
<ul>
<li>At the airport, I heard a page for "Katy Perry".     Normally,     my reaction would be, "Oh, that poor woman has the same name     as the singer."     But since I'm in Los Angeles,     I have to give consideration to the possibility     that it really is the singer. </li>
<li>On the ride from the airport to the hotel,     I observed part of a police car chase,     or at least two police cars rushing through traffic with lights on.     Welcome to Los Angeles. </li>
<li>I decided to walk from my hotel to the convention center     rather than taking the shuttle bus.     Along the way, I spotted a bus coming down the street.     The driver parked the bus in the right-hand lane     (a lane which is normally used for <i>driving</i>),     got off,     and walked into the Carl's Jr.     I took a peek inside, and he was at the counter ordering breakfast.     I guess he figured the bus wouldn't fit in the drive-through.     Welcome to Los Angeles. </li>
<li>I thought it would have been funny if Michael Anguilo had said,     "And we're making these devices available to attendees for     just $500. [beat] Just kidding.     <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2011/09/13/more-buzz-from-build-developers-get-their-devices.aspx">     You're each getting one for free</a>."     Or pulled an Oprah. "Everybody, look under your chair!     Ha-ha, made you look!" </li>
<li>You spend a good amount of time listening to the music     that plays before the keynote begins.     Imagine having that as your job.     "I write music for conferences.     My music is peppy, but not too much;     hopeful, but with a little bit of attitude.     And not so good you want to dance to it.     And I have to write a dozen different versions,     each one exactly fifteen seconds longer than the previous one.     Oh, and it needs to segue into a higher-energy version     when the speaker arrives on stage." </li>
<li>The City National Grove at Anaheim is not a city,     not national, and not a grove.     I do concede, however that it is in Anaheim. </li>
<li>If you look closely at the //build/ logo, you'll also     notice that the second slash has partially decapitated     the b.     I tried reproducing the effect here, but my CSS-fu isn't     powerful enough. </li>
<li><b>Bonus</b>:     The hotel I'm staying at is hosting a conference     on hotel conference security.     I wonder who provides security for that conference. </li>
</ul>

		<p>I don&#39;t think your CSS-fu is weak. It looks like the //build/ logo is a png image. Or were you just trying to replicate that effect from image in CSS?</p>

		<p>You can tell whether the cops were actually doing something important or not by how long the lights were on before and after they went through the intersection. &nbsp;Back in Boston, it was really common for the cops to feel they didn&#39;t need to wait for red lights like the rest of us, so they&#39;d flip on the lights and siren a second or two before getting there, run the light, and then turn the lights and siren right back off. &nbsp;It&#39;s not legal, but they watch out for each other, so they never get in trouble for it.</p>
<p>It must be a local thing&#8211;I&#39;ve lived in places where it happened all the time and places where I basically never see it.</p>

		<p>Rick: In some places at odd hours of the night the cops/ambulances don&#39;t want to make a lot of noise for no reason. So they only use the siren when passing red lights or other cars.</p>

		<p>Los Angeles? I&#39;m confused. I thought the conference was in Anaheim. Anaheim is not even in LA County. (Though the Angels, which play in Anaheim, are now&#8211;for some reason&#8211;a Los Angeles team. Go figure.)</p>

		<p>As a detective in 1947 LA, I drive around at full throttle with sirens blaring to get to my next destination, even if it&#39;s just interviewing a suspect in custody at the police station. &nbsp;I don&#39;t care if a take out a couple of street posts or pedestrians or bang up a few cars on the way.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s obvious &#8211; you have to gate-crash their conference to find out. If you&#39;re evicted, ask them who they work for. If you get in, you can tell them they&#39;re doing it wrong.</p>

		<p>perl -pe, pfff. Real men use sed. In fact, on my system &quot;perl&quot; is a script that outputs &quot;If you want regular expression processing, use sed. If you want to program, use Python^H^H^H^H^H^Hsed too.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, not really. My system actually doesn&#39;t have perl (but it does have sed &#8212; don&#39;t ask).</p>

		<p>@Neil, not really, no. I am, though, fascinated by the way two errors came together like that to have, between them, no effect. I generally wouldn&#39;t use jsFiddle like that, but I edited in vi and just was just using jsFiddle to share :p</p>

		<p>In LA, there are places where parking is allowed the right lane sometimes. I learn to not use the right lane there..</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t know of any place like that in Anaheim.</p>

		<p>The badges still have all the same design problems that you&#39;ve pointed out/ranted about in the past.</p>

		<p>For the stories where you were actually in Anaheim, please don&#39;t call it L.A. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t grow up in Anaheim to hear it be reduced to L.A. &nbsp; :P</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
