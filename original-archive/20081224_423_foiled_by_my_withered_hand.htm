		<p>This instruction page really belongs in the fail blog (<a href="http://failblog.org/" target=_new rel=nofollow rel="nofollow">http://failblog.org/</a>)</p>
<p>After years and years of software being produced in the world, Microsoft managed to figure out a way to screw up one more thing which no one ever thought was could possibly be screwable.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>And yet when the new box design was announced, <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2006/10/30/announcing-new-packaging-for-windows-vista-and-2007-office-system.aspx" rel="nofollow">people liked it</a>. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you guys chose to try something new instead of continuing with the old oversized paper boxes.&#8221; If you try something new, you suck for not sticking to the old way.

		<p>Hmm&#8230; my copy of Vista came in an easy-to-open folder that required a tool to cut open the plastic dot&#8230;</p>
<p>My copy of office 2007 requires cutting a similar dot, and downloading it since no DVD was present inside, just a CD-key.</p>

		<p>Vista was fine. It had a red tag to open it. The &nbsp;Visual Studio 2008 box on the other hand, is exactly the same colour red as the tag, and so it appears not to have one :)</p>

		<p>Raymiond (I don&#8217;t assume you are reading this) &#8211; the box does not suck for trying something new, the box sucks at usability.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sharing the Visual Studio 2008 experience:</p>
<p>the box is stylish (in a positive sense), but everyone fiddles with it. In the office, zhe opinion on the designer is torn: between &quot;earned big money&quot; and &quot;won a prize&quot;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the antithesis of todays &quot;invisible UI&quot; axiom, a bold choice for wrapping software.</p>

		<p>I followed the &quot;people liked it&quot; link. There were a large number of comments saying how nice it looked, followed by a similar number saying how difficult it was to open. Perhaps people only liked it until they tried to use it?</p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t like the box at all. &nbsp;I have somewhat gone through the learning curve, but still, every time I am confronted with one of these boxes, I get confused all over again. &nbsp;And I like to think that I&#8217;m pretty smart.</p>
<p>The gratuitous snipe at MS for redesigning the packaging AND the Office 2007 interface that JoelOnSoftware offers, is unwarranted: the advantages far outweigh the fact that the Office 2007 ribbon/toolbat is different.</p>
<p>Change can be good or bad, but we didn&#8217;t really need a ton of innovation in packaging, did we?</p>
<p>Sorry to digress. &nbsp;It should be obvious from the passion on this issue that a LOT of normal people don&#8217;t like the new packaging.</p>
<p>Sorry about your withered hand, Raymond! &nbsp;:-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
