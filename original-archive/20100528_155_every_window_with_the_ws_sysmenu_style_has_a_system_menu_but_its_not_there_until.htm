<p>I mentioned last time that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/27/10016004.aspx"> there's an optimization in the treatment of the system menu</a> which significantly reduces the number of menus in the system.</p>
<p> When a window has the <code>WS_<wbr>SYSMENU</wbr></code> window style, it has a system menu, but until somebody calls <code>Get&shy;System&shy;Menu</code> on that window, nobody knows what its menu handle is. Until that point, the window manager doesn't actually have to commit to creating a menu for the window; it can just pretend that the window has one. (This technique goes by the fancy name <i>lazy initialization</i>.) </p>
<p> The window manager creates a global default system menu which contains the standard system menu items. If somebody presses Alt+Space or otherwise calls up the system menu for a window that has never had <code>Get&shy;System&shy;Menu</code> called on it, the window manager just uses the global default system menu, since it knows that nobody has customized the menu. (You can't customize a menu you don't have the handle to!) Since most people never customize their system menu, this optimization avoids cluttering the desktop heap with identical copies of the same menu. This was a particularly important optimization back in the 16-bit days, when all window manager objects had to fit into a single 64KB heap (known as <i>System Resources</i>). </p>
<p> If you are really sneaky, you can catch a glimpse of the elusive <i>global default system menu</i> as it whizzes by: As with any other popup menu, the handle to the menu being displayed is passed to your window's <code>WM_<wbr>INIT&shy;MENU&shy;POPUP</wbr></code>, and if your program has never called <code>Get&shy;System&shy;Menu</code>, the handle that you will see is the global default system menu. Mind you, you can't do much to this menu, since the window manager blocks any attempt to modify it. (Otherwise, your program's menu modification would have an unintended effect on the menus of other programs!) </p>
<p> Therefore, if your program is in the habit of modifying its system menu in its <code>WM_<wbr>INIT&shy;MENU&shy;POPUP</wbr></code> handler, you should stick a dummy call to <code>Get&shy;System&shy;Menu</code> in your <code>WM_<wbr>CREATE</wbr></code> handler to force your system menu to change from a pretend system menu to a real one. </p>

		<p>you could also brute force though all possible menu handles and change all of them in some way. when you then open the system menu you would see that it did not change although you changed very single menu that exists!</p>

		<p>â€˜This was a particularly important optimization&#8230;â€™: Although perhaps to a lesser degree, such optimisations are still important. I know that premature optimisation is the root of all evil, but that doesn&#39;t mean that people shouldn&#39;t write tight code; especially memory consumption is important to pay attention to since it&#39;s too easy to negatively impact not just yourself with cache misses and swapping, but other processes too. I always get depressed a little when I see version 10 of some software run more slowly on today&#39;s hardware than version 3 did in the 90s.</p>

		<p>Makes me wonder if some apps that change the system menu globally (like the nVidia nView stuff) modify the &quot;pseudo-system menu&quot; once or do GetSystemMenu for every window that&#39;s created.</p>
<p>Might explain why desktop heaps get depleted fast on XP if every window has the system menu optimization disabled and you have a lot of windows open.</p>

		<p>@Worf &#8211; I shudder to think. You can be sure that any app writer who&#39;s totally convinced you need to see evidence of their cleverness just everywhere you turn doesn&#39;t care too much about being a good citizen.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
