<p>
Today's Microspeak term is <i>stand up</i>,
as a verb.
This is not to be confused with
<i>stand-up</i> as a noun, referring to
a short meeting according to the agile development model.
It's also not to be confused with a form of comedy,
usually performed in front of a brick wall for some reason.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the Microspeak term <i>stand up</i>
means "to get something working and available for use." 
Here are some citations:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=m><p>
There's a dashboard for this that Bob stood up.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=m><p>
The team stood up a branch for this feature.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the first example, Bob has created a
<a HREF="http://www.dashboardinsight.com/articles/digital-dashboards/fundamentals/what-is-a-dashboard.aspx">
dashboard</a>
and has gotten it to a point where it is functional
and available for use.
Other members of the team can open the dashboard
(usually a Web page, though sometimes it's a dedicated program)
and see the status of whatever it is Bob is trying to show
the status of.
</p>
<p>
In the second example,
the team created a branch to use for implementing the feature,
but more importantly, the team has provisioned
resources to build and deploy the code in that branch,
either on an ongoing basis,
or to be
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20131112-00/?p=2683">
spun up</a>
on request.</p>

		<p>I wonder if there is any relationship to the journalistic phrase &#8216;stand it up&#8217; which means to have enough evidence to run a story.  I first heard this when my brother-in-law was told something juicy over the phone about a British MP but queried whether there was any other evidence that would stand the story up.  Maybe both have their origins in a patient being well enough to stand up on their own?</p>

		<p>The editor&#8217;s concern is &#8220;will it stand up in court?&#8221;  I guess your usage derives from that.</p>
<p>Going back to the the post, I understood that Bob invited a dashboard on a date and then failed to attend.  Bob is not a stand-up guy.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve heard of this term in both my professional life and on the web.  I&#8217;ve heard it used mostly in reference to making a new server available for use.  To me, the only time when this phrase had a connection to reality was back when a &#8220;server&#8221; meant a jumped-up desktop tower, and making a new one available for use meant physically standing it up out of the box and into the server room.  Nowadays, with VMs ruling the roost and 1U/2U+ servers being common place, it&#8217;s just an annoying bit of language puffery.  Not as bad as many other microspeak examples, but not needed, either.  Both of the examples could be written more clearly with &#8220;created&#8221; substituted for &#8220;stood up&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I think most places now-a-days refer to making a server available as &#8220;provisioning&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well, at least in Russian we use a word that means &#8220;make something stand&#8221; both for newly created servers and servers that were brought back to life after downtime. It is informal, but is used and understood by anyone who has ever worked with servers.</p>
<p>We also say that a server &#8220;has fallen&#8221; if it goes down, btw.</p>

		<p>I remember a sysadmin I worked with saying something about how the company thought that a server had been set up as a failover, but it had been set up as a fall-over instead.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Created&#8221; is a prerequisite for but is not the same as &#8220;stood up&#8221;. For example, Bob may have created his dashboard, but it&#8217;s not ready yet (still too buggy). The branch may have been created, but no build resources have been provisioned yet.</p>

		<p>The military also uses the term for establishing a unit, e.g. &#8220;Fort Benning to stand up security force brigades, training academy&#8221;. The other end is probably better known, &#8220;standing down&#8221;.</p>

(US, military, transitive) To formally activate and commission (a unit, formation, etc.).<br />

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
