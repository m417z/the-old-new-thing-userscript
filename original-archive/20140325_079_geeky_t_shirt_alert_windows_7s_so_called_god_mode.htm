<p> Back in 2010, <a href="http://brandonlive.com/2010/01/04/the-so-called-god-mode/"> the so-called God Mode</a> was the hit discovery of the Internet, at least until the next cute cat video made the rounds.

<p> Of course, if you actually wore that shirt, you would also get stuffed into a locker and have your lunch money stolen from you. </p>

		<p>There was also a Windows 8 GodMode {F90C627B-7280-45DB-BC26-CCE7BDD620A4} with regular CPL Tasks+PC Settings Tasks that was removed in Windows 8.1 to be replaced by .settingcontent-ms files.</p>
<p>FYI, the Windows 7 Start Menu not only searched the GodMode folder but also its keywords. Not all Start Menus on the market today search that. I know Classic Shell does search. Neither does the Start screen because it&#39;s supposed to be &quot;improved&quot;. e.g if you type: hibernate, the Start screen doesn&#39;t find anything. The Start Menu smartly shows you Power Options.</p>

		<p>Typing hibernate on the Start screen in Windows 8.1 shows an item called &quot;Turn off your PC&quot; but pressing enter doesn&#39;t actually do anything. I have disabled hibernation though, and don&#39;t care to try with it enabled.</p>

		<p>I picked up one of those shirts, I still wear it from time to time. And no, I didn&#39;t get stuffed into a locker nor had my lunch money stolen :-)</p>

		<p>I once asked somebody what the point of &quot;God Mode&quot; was, since there&#39;s way too many options to browse through casually. His reply was that &quot;you can search it&quot;!</p>

		<p>@John: &quot;Typing hibernate on the Start screen in Windows 8.1&quot;</p>
<p>Also true in Win8 as well, if you search settings instead of just programs. (Win-W then start typing.) I didn&#39;t try to select it.</p>

		<p>@Evan, ah, indeed. Control Panel keyword search works only for WIn+W, not Win+S/Win+Q. Similarly Advanced Query Syntax now works only for Win+F. But didn&#39;t MS tout unified search in Windows 8.1? So it&#39;s natural to expect a unified search. :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
