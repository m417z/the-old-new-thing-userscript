<p>A customer noticed that when you right-click on <i>Computer</i> in the second column of the Start menu on Windows&nbsp;Vista, the first two options are <i>Open</i> and <i>Explore</i>. On the other hand, in Windows&nbsp;7, the <i>Explore</i> option is gone, leaving just <i>Open</i>. The customer also noticed that in Windows&nbsp;Vista, the two commands had the same effect and wondered if <i>Explore</i> was removed because it was redundant.</p>
<p> The response from the product team was a very simple "Yes." </p>
<p> It's interesting when a customer notices a relatively insignificant UI change, figures out the likely reason for the change, and then asks for confirmation. It's not like the reason for the change affects anything. My guess is that the customer already paid for a support contract so they're just going to use it, even when the issue wouldn't normally be worth raising a support incident over. </p>

		<p>Maybe, maybe not. Just to reassure that is the normal behavior &#8211; in suspect of virus infection (or a malfunctioning shell extension), he detected the absense of &#39;Explore&#39; command and didn&#39;t remember if it is a normal behavior or a side effect of his/her suspects&#8230;</p>

		<p>Maybe it came up because their old end-user support documentation still has a reference to &quot;Right click on the Start Button, select Explore&quot; and some PHB wanted confirmation before they modify the documentation.</p>

		<p>We&#39;re still on Windows XP. &nbsp;What does Open do in Windows 7? &nbsp;Does it replicate the behavior of the old WinXP Open, or of the old WinXP Explore? &nbsp;(I&#39;m hoping Explore, because I never want the Open behavior.)</p>

		<p>@configurator: Because in XP the explorer was supporting showing only action pane or folder tree, not both. The action pane was replaced by toolbar in Vista, so folder tree is shown by default in all explorer windows. Later somebody discovered that, after this design change, both commands result in the same window, so they managed to remove one of them in Windows 7.</p>

		<p>Normally, when you have a partition or a pendrive with an autorun within, the OPEN option will execute the autorun, and the EXPLORE option will call Windows Explorer. but autoruns can also change this behavior&#8230;</p>
<p>In Windows XP, When you call Open on the &quot;My Computer&quot; icon, the default window for my computer is opened, but if you choose Explore, Windows Explorer open &quot;My Computer&quot; with a different window, one that you can browse the directory tree, which is shown on the left side of the window.</p>
<p>But for directories, this option still appears because that&#39;s the default option menu. you can change the default option menu in Windows registries, through regedit.</p>

		<p>@sean: that was exactly my thought at first, but then remember that Raymond is apparently talking about an actual support incident. &nbsp;Generally, idle curiosity doesn&#39;t rise to that level of action.</p>
<p>Not that it&#39;s particularly surprising when it does, either.</p>

		<p>Somewhat related: Why is that in Vista/W7 it&#39;s no longer possible to open an Explorer window without the tree and just the contents of a folder? Or is it? </p>
<p>I kind of miss that from XP.</p>

		<p>Well you know what? I want the ability to QUICKLY toggle the folder pane ON and OFF so Explore is not the same as Open. The Organize button way doesn&#39;t do it fast enough. Either give us a toggle button like XP had (and Windows 7 for preview pane) or at least a keyboard shortcut. Or at least a way to toggle it programmatically so I can write my own little app to do it. Why the shell team wants users to decide for once whether to use the navigation pane or not and not toggle it is beyond me. Plus it won&#39;t even save this setting per folder like XP did. I don&#39;t want the navigation pane for Printers or Administrative Tools. Please repair this in Windows 8 if anyone from the shell team cares about feedback.</p>

		<p>Technically, the explore and open verbs are already pretty redundant in XP, since there&#39;s a toggle button that turns the folder tree on and off.</p>
<p>P.S. Is it true that this button was removed in Vista? If so, why?</p>

		<p>@Anonymous Coward: The task list that formerly filled that space in XP when the search or folder views weren&#39;t being displayed was made into a toolbar in Windows Vista and 7, so the folder view (and favorite places, if you&#39;re using Vista) are always displayed on the left unless you explicitly turn it off in the organize menu.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
