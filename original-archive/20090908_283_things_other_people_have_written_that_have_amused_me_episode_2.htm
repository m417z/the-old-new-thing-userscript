		<p>But you can already do both nostrils in parallel. &nbsp;If you&#8217;re really good you can do it with one hand, leaving your other hand free for real work. &nbsp;The Japanese are years ahead of us and have probably already invented a hands-free nose picking apparatus, savings millions of minutes every year.</p>

		<p>By reading and replying to the tip, then reading the counter-reposte, and blogging it, you&#8217;ve probably more than lost the 5 minutes you were supposed to have gained this year.</p>

		<p>Depends, really.</p>
<p>It may be 5 minutes, but it may also automate a lot of needless clicking and constant attention.</p>
<p>E.g., I had to reinstall Windows CE 6. The install process goes:</p>
<p>1) Visual Studio 2005</p>
<p>2) Visual Studio SP1</p>
<p>3) Windows CE 6</p>
<p>4) Platform Builder SP1</p>
<p>5) Windows CE 6 R2</p>
<p>6) Windows CE 6 R2 Rollup 2008</p>
<p>7+) Windows CE 6 R2 Rollup 2009 Jan-Jul (one per month, usually)</p>
<p>Steps 6 and 7 must be repeated per architecture, so a typical ARM and x86 would mean around 18 installers to run, with the last bunch taking 3-20 minutes each. And you click next, next, wait 2+ minutes for &quot;calculating disk space&quot; to finish, next, next, next, wait for install (1-15+ minutes), next, finish, ok, close popup.</p>
<p>Tedious. I did a little bash/cmd script that ran each one quietly, and onlhy had a browser window popup (which I let accumulate to close en masse) and the &quot;This file was downloaded off the Internet&#8230;&quot;. Saved maybe 5 minutes, and it&#8217;s only something I&#8217;d do once or twice a year. But getting rid of those excessive clicks!</p>
<p>And yes, installing in Feb-March is best as by then you&#8217;d have the last year&#8217;s rollup. January is bad because you have 12 installs per architecture, or 24 updates. If you did three like I had to, 36!</p>

<p>Ah, you young whipper-snappers, you think you&#8217;ve got it tough, I&#8217;ve installed Windows CE&#8230; something, the one with eVC++ 4 as its compiler. &nbsp;The install process goes:</p>
<p>repeat while computers available:</p>
<p>find a spare machine;</p>
<p>install everything;</p>
<p>if eVC++ won&#8217;t start -&gt; continue;</p>
<p>if eVC++ won&#8217;t compile your code -&gt; continue;</p>
<p>if the emulator won&#8217;t start -&gt; continue;</p>
<p>if the emulator won&#8217;t load your binary -&gt; continue;</p>
<p>if the emulator won&#8217;t run your binary -&gt; continue;</p>
<p>set bSuccess = TRUE, break;</p>
<p>if !bSuccess -&gt; find another site and start trying their computers;</p>
<p>else</p>
<p>never, ever, ever, ever make any changes to the machine that now runs eVC++ 4 and WinCE whatever ever again;</p>
<p>WinCE 6? &nbsp;Pshaw!</p>

		<p>Funny, but I&#8217;ve never had that, using eVC++ since what, Talisker betas?</p>
<p>Heck, I&#8217;ve had CE 3/4 installed on the same machine.</p>
<p>These days though, the trick is to have CE 5, WinMo 6 and CE 6 installed, and behaving nicely on the same PC</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
