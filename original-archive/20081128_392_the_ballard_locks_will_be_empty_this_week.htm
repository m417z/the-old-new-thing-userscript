<p>The <a href="http://www.nws.usace.army.mil/PublicMenu/Menu.cfm?sitename=lwsc&amp;pagename=mainpage"> Hiram M. Chittenden Locks</a> (more commonly known as the <i>Ballard Locks</i>) are a common attraction in Seattle. But if you pay a visit for the next week, you'll find that the large set of locks will be empty. And not just empty of boats. Empty of water.</p>
<p> The chamber has been emptied of water for annual maintenance, and if you stop by, you can take pictures of a big hole in the ground. </p>
<p> According to <i>The Seattle Times</i>, items found upon draining the chamber include <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008441899_ballardlocks27.html"> cell phones, a two-way radio, a boot, beer cans, and prescription glasses</a>. Nothing too exciting, I have to admit. Now, if they had found a bicycle... </p>

		<p>Don&#8217;t joke about bicycles&#8230; every now and the police and the water authority clean up the waterways in my city and this always yields an impressive number of bicycle carcasses. Going by the looks of it, it must account for a large chunk of the eternal bicycle theft problem.</p>

		<p>I remember hearing on the history channel that each year when the various locks on the Great Lakes are drained, they tend to find atleast one car somewhere.</p>

		<p>On vacation in Amsterdam a couple of years ago, I saw a dredge maintaining a canal. It was full of bikes! I guess the combination of a very high percentage of the population having bikes, the ubiquitous canals, and the nearby bars leads to a great deal of cycling mishaps.</p>

		<p>Not just Amsterdam, every Dutch city really. Not sure what it is with canals, but they do attract bikes. A quick google tells me the city of Groningen managed to dredge 6000 metric tons of junk last year, mostly bikes and fridges!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
