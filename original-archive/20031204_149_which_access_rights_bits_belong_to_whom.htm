<p>Each ACE in a security descriptor contains a 32-bit access mask. Which bits belong to whom?</p>
<p> The access rights mask is a 32-bit value. The upper 16 bits are defined by the operating system and the lower 16 bits are defined by the object being secured. </p>
<p> For example, consider the value 0x00060002 for the access rights mask. This breaks down as the system-defined access rights WRITE_DAC (0x00040000), READ_CONTROL (0x00020000), and one object-defined access right 0x0002. </p>
<p> The object-defined access right 0x0002 depends on the object. This particular access right might mean any of the following: </p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>meaning</th>
<th>if the object is a...</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FILE_WRITE_DATA</td>
<td>file</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FILE_ADD_FILE</td>
<td>directory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD</td>
<td>process</td>

<tr>
<td>THREAD_SUSPEND_RESUME</td>
<td>thread</td>

<td>JOB_OBJECT_SET_ATTRIBUTES</td>
<td>job object</td>

<tr>
<td>EVENT_MODIFY_STATE</td>

<td>token</td>

</tr>
</table>
<p> or it could mean something else entirely if it's an object of a type not listed above. </p>
<p> If you ask the  ConvertSecurityDescriptorToStringSecurityDescriptor function to convert a security descriptor to a string security descriptor, it tries to guess what the object is, but since there is so little information to go on, it usually guesses wrong. The access rights mask above, for example, would be rendered by SDDL as "DCRCWD".  The rights RC = READ_CONTROL, WD = WRITE_DAC are standard across all objects, so there is no guessing there. But SDDL guessed that 0x0002 was DC = ADS_RIGHTS_DS_DELETE_CHILD. </p>
<p> Notice that there are some system-defined access rights that are named "GENERIC", such as GENERIC_READ and GENERIC_WRITE.  Each object exposes different "read-like", "write-like", and possibly "execute-like" access rights (for example, registry keys have KEY_QUERY_VALUE and KEY_SET_VALUE), but they all have to define which ones are read-like, which ones are write-like, and which ones are execute-like, so that you can request one of the GENERIC access masks and get access appropriate to the type of object you are opening. </p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
