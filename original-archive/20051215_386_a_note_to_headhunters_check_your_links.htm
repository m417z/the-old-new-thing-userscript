		<p>Not sure if it&#8217;s your case, but this is usually related to not so technically aware people,that paste links that are only internally visible, without FQDN. And I&#8217;m sure I have seen such links even in relation with Microsoft (Mostly on research.microsoft.com I think)</p>

		<p>MSDN once shipped a program whose startup links all went back to Redmond servers.</p>
<p>I had a recruiter email me this morning to say she had a number of positions that she thought matched my [monster] resume. Then suggested I look at the link to her entire open position list of jobs and upload my resume to her company&#8217;s site so that employers could study it. I mean WTF do these people get paid for?</p>

		<p>It might have been a spoofed mail from the Microsoft HR department to see if Raymond is open to leaving. Now that they know he won&#8217;t, they needn&#8217;t give him that large pay hike planned for January ;-)</p>

		<p>Yeah, The invetion of monster produced a whole new job type for people who wanted to go out and scan monster profiles and then email these people saying they are a head hunter and can find you a job!  I hear that &quot;scam&quot; (scam in quotes, because arguably it&#8217;s not a scam persay) makes some people upwards of $100k per year.  I suppose it&#8217;s a great example of the double edged sword that is the &#8216;net.</p>

		<p>Of course, you&#8217;ve just told them that you tried to follow the link, thus expressing some kind of interest in being headhunted.</p>

<br />Most of the horked links I&#8217;ve found start with C:; the sad part is that when you call them on it, they fob it off with &quot;but I&#8217;m not a technical person&quot;, like that excuses their incompetence.</p>

		<p>These days when they call or email I try to mess with their heads.  I tell them that I&#8217;m happy with my current job, but I&#8217;d consider leaving for 2 or 3 times my current salary.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of a phishing email I got about a year ago.  It was the standard &quot;please update your ebay info&quot; thing.  (It was obviously fake, since I had no ebay account.)</p>
<p>So I went to the page, to see what they were asking for.  Viewing the source was an interesting exercise in stupidity &#8212; lo and behold, right in the middle of the page somewhere, there was a large script tag whose src attribute read &quot;file:///c|/Documents%20and%20Settings/someusername/Desktop/ebay_files/blah.js&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it worked fine on the phisher&#8217;s machine&#8230;  sigh.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
