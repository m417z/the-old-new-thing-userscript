<p>Last year, to celebrate successful completion of a project milestone, our group went on a "cultural expedition" to a glass-blowing studio where we were to learn about the craft of glass blowing and even do some of it ourselves. (By the way, it was fun.)</p>
<p> One of the glassblowers had been making a lot of little jokes about Frodo and Mount Doom. Working with molten glass does that to a person, I guess. When it came time to break up into smaller groups, each working with a different glassblower, the Tolkein-obsessed glassblower announced, "Okay, let's do it this way. <i>Lord of the Ring</i> fans on this side of the room, <i>Star Trek</i> on the other." </p>
<p> After a brief pause, a few of us casually crossed to the other side of the room. </p>
<p> Okay, maybe we're nerds. You decide. </p>
<p> Hey, at least nobody asked, "What about <i>Harry Potter</i>?" </p>

		<p>@Timothy: It&#8217;s really not a problem doing that and not very expensive. What you have to do is call them and say &quot;Hi, I&#8217;m the trip coordinator (maybe my translation is a bit off, but you know what I mean) for the ____ group. We are organizing a trip to your city and thought we might have an introduction to glass blowing. How much would it cost us to have such an introduction at your studio?&quot;</p>
<p>The point is, you tell them it&#8217;s part of your fun trip and only one option amongst many &#8211; I&#8217;ve done it successfully a few times as a trip coordinator where I used to work.</p>

		<p>Another big Discworld fan here. I&#8217;ve read both Tolkien and Harry Potter, but I definitvely prefer Discworld, with Tolkien on a close second. (I&#8217;m not a Harry Potter fan at all, but the movies are quite OK)</p>

		<p>@Michael G: I know about the Star Trek movies, but are you telling me that Lord of the RIngs isn&#8217;t just a book anymore?</p>
<p>(Okay, okay I&#8217;m kidding. But then I was so familiar with the book that the movie cast hasn&#8217;t overwritten my mental images of the characters. I also don&#8217;t think Peter Jackson&#8217;s effort was so perfect that someone won&#8217;t try to do a remake some time this century. On the other hand, there were certain bits of the films that I loved &#8211; the theme music for Edoras, for example.)</p>
<p>So if you are a Discworld fan, what do you think of &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot; compared to the other books?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
