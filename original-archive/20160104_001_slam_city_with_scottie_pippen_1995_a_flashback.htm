<p>
For some reason, I was reminded of this game.
</p>
<p>
It appears from
<a HREF="http://semajblogeater.blogspot.com/2014/07/slam-city-with-scottie-pippen-holy-crap.html">
all</a>
<a HREF="http://www.sega-16.com/2012/11/slam-city-with-scotty-pippen/">
reports</a>
that the SEGA version of this game sucked.
</p>
<p>
Well, the PC version sucked too.
</p>
<p>
It was basically a port of
<a HREF="http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/#Computer Games">
some game
from <i>Creative Computing</i></a>.
</p>
<pre>
You have the ball. You can

1. Drive left
2. Drive right
3. Shoot

Your choice ?
</pre>
<p>
Your player was represented as a sprite of a photograph
of a basketball player,
and if you said "3", for example,
the sprite moved up, then back down,
and then you learned whether the ball went in.
At least that's how I remember it.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=slam%20city%20with%20scottie%20pippen">
This phenomenal gameplay</a> was supported by four CDs.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and the goal of the game was not to score more
points than your opponent.
That would be too easy.
The goal of the game is to earn "respect",
so that you could someday play against the
Big Boss: Scottie Pippen.</p>
<p>
I had to figure out why the opening title sequence
of the game didn't work on Windows&nbsp;95.
</p>
<p>
I don't think I solved that one.
The opening title sequence never worked on Windows&nbsp;95,
at least not without using MS-DOS mode.
I console myself by thinking that removing the title
sequence was an improvement.
It meant that you would waste less time playing this stupid game.</p>

		<p>Maybe most of the development time was spent on the games custom rap song: &#8220;Watcha gotta do? Earn respect!&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;on the court, I&#8217;ll be dunkin, like donuts&#8221; &#8220;1 on 1, here I come son!&#8221; Performed by Scottie Pippen according to the games credits.</p>

		<p>All of the FMV games sucked real hard as games and they still live on as interactive DVD games. I&#8217;m sure that some people like them.</p>
<p>I wonder what the problem was.</p>

		<p>BTW, were there specific criteria for making a game work at all costs vs. leaving it be if it had problems too weird to debug?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
