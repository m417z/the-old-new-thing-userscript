<p>
Here are some citations.
Let's see if we can figure out what it means.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
I think a presentation of these results would be a fun boost for the team.
Is this something we should handle in a bunch of teams'
weekly meetings,
or should we do something <i>all up</i>?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the first citation, <i>all up</i> appears to mean
"with everybody all together."
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
We're looking for an <i>all-up</i> view
of the various compatibility mitigations we have related to this feature.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the second citation, <i>all up</i> could mean
"overview" or "detailed summary".
Not sure yet.
Let's keep looking.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
From the <i>all up</i> performance effort,
we've settled on the approach below.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Okay, this seems to suggest that
<i>all up</i> refers to an aggregation of individual items.
Let's try again:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
We have a number of channels for disseminating information.
I think an all up destination could play a key and proactive role
in major announcements such as the one from last week.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, <i>all up</i> appears to mean
"consolidated, comprehensive".
Let's keep going.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
Document title: XYZ <i>All Up</i> Glossary
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This document is a glossary.
Presumably is a glossary of terms you may encounter throughout
the entire XYZ project.
One last citation,
this from a status report:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<ul>
<li>This week: Created Customer <i>All up</i> report.
<li>Next week: Update Customer <i>all up</i> report with more customer
    related information.
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Okay, this didn't actually tell me much about what
an <i>all up</i> report is,
which is kind of a bummer because I was asked to create an
<i>all up report</i>,
and I still don't know if what I created is what the person wanted.
</p>
<p>
(I ended up creating a report that summarized the status of
every team,
and called out issues that were noteworthy or reasons for concern.
The person who asked for the report didn't complain,
so I guess that was close enough to what they wanted that they
didn't bother asking for more.)</p>

		<p>Reading the citations, I guess the term has different meanings for each person. I agree with Matt Smith on the &#39;average&#39; meaning, but I think it&#39;s safe to say that it is being used with different nuances, to say the least. Maybe it&#39;s one of those terms nobody can define.</p>

		<p>This is obviously a new one because it doesn&#39;t appear to have become a verb yet. &nbsp;When someone says something like &quot;can you all-up that for me?&quot; it&#39;ll be more interesting (and more concerning).</p>

		<p>This is a wonderful illustration of the kind of guesswork we non-Americans, and non-American-speaking people, have to do all the time with similar expressions not only from MS newspeak (/microspeak) but from all areas of society. Most of it &#8211; the part that is not MS-specific &#8211; you never notice, because it seeps naturally(?) into your everyday language through media. For someone not exposed to US media all the time, it can be a real nuisance, requiring significant resources to figure out what they really mean, those Americans. </p>
<p>Sometimes we give up, concluding that it is probably some kind of newspeak. If it is being asssocated the speaker himself or his asocciations, it probably has some fuzzy positive meaning. If it is associated with a competitor or enemy, it probably has some fuzzy negative meaning. That is usually close enough.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
