<p> Well that clears things up. </p>
<p> Curiously, the message includes an incident duration but doesn't have an ETA. Thankfully, the message was sent one minute after the incident was over, so by the time I got it, everything was back to normal. </p>

		<p>If I had gotten that email, with no more context than appears in this post, I would have read it as &quot;The incident has lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes so far, and we don&#39;t know how much longer it will last&quot;.</p>
<p>Further, since it&#39;s an initial incident going out over an hour after the Start Time, and it&#39;s going at at just after 1 AM, they are probably still at the phase of waking up the escalation points, etc, and getting them to all join the bridge and argue&#8230; I mean, discuss what went wrong. That 12 AM Start Time (&#8230; Nice, round number) is a guess.</p>
<p>I&#39;d expect an actual, real update to follow shortly.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve seen this kind of report quite often when there are systems in place which constantly badger anyone working on an outage. &nbsp;You can see the well meant intentions behind them, but when it gets to the third or fourth, &quot;please respond to acknowledge you are still working on the issue&quot; message, someone with their head deep in trying to bring a server back up is going to respond with whatever gets the annoyance to go away quickest. dsasddfs usually being the thing that does the trick.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, we ditched one of the popular alerting systems a while back due to this combined with its extremely unreliable handling of acknowledgement messages; rather than one person working on the actual problem, it ended up with two or three people running round sending, &quot;yes we&#39;re working on it, the notification system&#39;s just gone crazy&quot; e-mails and text messages as the system happily trundled on towards the world-is-ending levels of its escalation list.)</p>

		<p>@Roman: Actually, Windows Event Viewer is full of these, all of them tagged as critical error. So, is Reliability Monitor. My personal favorite (not) is &quot;Windows Explorer has stopped working&quot;, especially when Windows Explorer is working as usual and nothing is wrong.</p>

		<p>@Mark: I&#39;m pretty sure your interpretation is correct. I found a set of major incident notifications and the duration went up every hour as they sent out status updates. The resolution notification had the final duration. The system my group uses just has a start time listed while the incident is active. The resolution notice has start time and end time and you have to do the math for duration yourself. The notices are also color coded. So if you get a red or yellow one you know the issue is ongoing. If you get a green one the issue is resolved.</p>

		<p>My interpretation is that someone was trying to test the notification system (especially since it was about an incident that perhaps never even existed) but possibly didn&#39;t realize that it was live and would spam the whole company.</p>

		<p>@MNGoldenEagle:</p>
<p>Also it could be the other instance. Its windows would appear as unresponsive and after some time they would start to react once again. (Have very recent observation&#8230;) It&#39;(s classified as crash.</p>

		<p>But surely this calls for a support incident regarding the company-wide, uninformative major incident, in order to ensure that it will never be sent again?</p>

		<p>I remember getting a letter in the mail from my company&#39;s business class internet provider informing us that our static IPs would be changing. &nbsp;Based on when we received notice, we had less than three days to prepare our systems. &nbsp;Since we ran email in house at the time, that translated to a potential for email to go missing for the next week or two as our changes propagated. &nbsp;I called our sales person with the provider to complain that more time would have been appropriate, and he said he was glad we had a few days notice, since some other customers had received their formal notice AFTER their static IPs had changed.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
