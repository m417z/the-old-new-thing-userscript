<p>I dreamed that that I was driving through a parking garage when my brakes suddenly failed. I tried executing turns to bleed off speed, but it was largely ineffective. I managed to avoid hitting a parked police car (which had arrived to investigate some other accident), but was unable to avoid another parked car.</p>
<p> An insurance adjuster who was on the scene for the first accident looked at my car and discovered that my primary brake pads were completely missing, so the calipers were grabbing air. And in my panic, it never occurred to me to use my left foot to push the button which hot-installs the secondary brake pads. (Yes, this makes no sense. It's a dream, remember?) </p>
<p> I tried to order replacement pads from Amazon.com, but it insisted on ordering them for the virtual car in my account rather than the actual car that had the accident. </p>
<p> Also, true dream fact: Brake pads are made of Styrofoam. ("Well, there's your problem.") </p>

		<p>Outside of dreams, but still in the realm of fantasy, TV/movie characters that have their brakes fail seem to forget that there is also a handbrake, simply letting go of the accelerator and downshifting also helps you slow down and finally, so does turning off the engine. I seem to recall there&#39;s even an episode of the 1990&#39;s Superman TV show where this is spoofed, Superman flying in, landing on the passenger seat and simply turning the engine off.</p>

<p>In before someone with a locking steering wheel tries that and causes an accident.</p>

		<p>@Blacgwolf: Agreed. Power steering will stop to function as soon as you switch off the engine, making you impossible to turn. Always make sure you have plenty of space ahead when you need to choose this path.</p>

		<p>&gt;there is also a handbrake</p>
<p>As any number of female drivers have discovered, you can drive quite some distance with the handbrake on. &nbsp;It&#39;s to stop the car from rolling, not to stop it period.</p>

		<p>OK, OK, I was joking :-). &nbsp;It&#39;ll wear out your rear brake pads (which is what the handbrake engages) and, depending on how far/fast/whatever you drove, may cause heat-related problems on brake rotors, rubber seals on caliper mounts, etc, depending on the type of brake and car.</p>

		<p>From my first car, I learned many things. One is that power steering is only really necessary in parking situations. Another is that the parking brake is really only useful in parking situations. You can drive quite normally with the parking brake engaged, but engaging the parking brake while driving will simply lock up the wheels and make you slide.</p>
<p>Also, I learned that the steering wheel locks only when you put the key in the position where you can remove it from the ignition. You can drive downhill easily without ignition or power steering, but your service brakes will be harder to use without the power.</p>

		<p>Last year I didn&#39;t get around to changing my brake pads until it was too late; so for a while I had no brakes. The hand-brake works fine when used in combination with gearing down &#8211; if you have a manual transmission. Actually the gearing thing has become a habit &#8211; at least it saves wear on the brakes now. Oh, and once you master sliding around corners, it&#39;s always a cool way to scare passengers.</p>

		<p>@Dave: &quot;As any number of female [sic :-)] drivers have discovered, you can drive quite some distance with the handbrake on.&quot;</p>
<p>The obligatory quote regarding this, of course, is from Mitch Hedberg:</p>
<p>&quot;I rent a lot of cars, but I don&#39;t always know everything about them. So a lot of times, I drive for like ten miles with the emergency brake on. That doesn&#39;t say a lot for me, but it really doesn&#39;t say a lot for the emergency brake. It&#39;s really not an emergency brake; it&#39;s an emergency &#39;make the car smell funny&#39; lever.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Cheong00: It is not impossible to turn without power-assisted steering. It just requires more upper body strength than a flea.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
