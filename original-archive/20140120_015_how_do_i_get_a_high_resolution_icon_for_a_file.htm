Today's Little Program obtains a high resolution icon for a file.
</p>
<p>
Start with our
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
scratch program</a>
and make these changes.
Remember, Little Programs do little or no error checking.
This week's smart pointer class is (rolls dice)
<code>_com_ptr_t</code>!
</p>
<pre>
...
#include &lt;shlwapi.h&gt;
<font COLOR=blue>#include &lt;commoncontrols.h&gt;
#include &lt;comip.h&gt;
#include &lt;comdef.h&gt;

_COM_SMARTPTR_TYPEDEF(IImageList, __uuidof(IImageList));</font>

HICON g_hico;</font>

HINSTANCE g_hinst;                          /* This application's HINSTANCE */
...

<font COLOR=blue>int GetIconIndex(PCTSTR pszFile)
{
  SHFILEINFO sfi;
  SHGetFileInfo(pszFile, 0, &amp;sfi, sizeof(sfi), SHGFI_SYSICONINDEX);
  return sfi.iIcon;
}

HICON GetJumboIcon(int iImage)
{
  IImageListPtr spiml;
  SHGetImageList(SHIL_JUMBO, IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;spiml));

  HICON hico;
  spiml-&gt;GetIcon(iImage, ILD_TRANSPARENT, &hico);
  return hico;
}</font>
</pre>
<p>
The
<code>Get&shy;Icon&shy;Index</code> function does nothing new.
It simply retrieves the system image list icon index for a file's icon.
</p>
<p>
The
<code>Get&shy;Jumbo&shy;Icon</code> retrieves an icon by its
system image list index.
First, it asks
<code>SHGet&shy;Image&shy;List</code> for the jumbo image list,
then it asks the jumbo image list
for the icon.
</p>
<p>
Now all we have to do is hook the functions up.
</p>
<pre>
void
PaintContent(HWND hwnd, PAINTSTRUCT *pps)
{
  <font COLOR=blue>DrawIconEx(pps-&gt;hdc, 50, 50, g_hico,
             0, 0, 0, nullptr, DI_NORMAL);</font>
}

    ...
    if (SUCCEEDED(CoInitialize(NULL))) {/* In case we use COM */

        <font COLOR=blue>g_hico = GetJumboIcon(GetIconIndex(lpCmdLine));</font>

        ...
        <font COLOR=blue>DestroyIcon(g_hico);</font>
        CoUninitialize();
    }
    ...
</pre>
<p>
Run this program and pass the full path to a file on the command line.
(No quotation marks, even if it contains spaces!)
Result: A gigantic icon for the file appears.
</p>
<p>
Instead of converting the system imagelist index into an icon,
we could just ask the jumbo imagelist to render it directly.
</p>
<pre>
<font COLOR=blue>int g_iImage;</font>

void
PaintContent(HWND hwnd, PAINTSTRUCT *pps)
{
  <font COLOR=blue>IImageListPtr spiml;
  SHGetImageList(SHIL_JUMBO, IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;spiml));

  IMAGELISTDRAWPARAMS ildp = { sizeof(ildp) };
  ildp.himl = IImageListToHIMAGELIST(spiml);
  ildp.i = g_iImage;
  ildp.hdcDst = pps-&gt;hdc;
  ildp.x = 50;
  ildp.y = 50;
  ildp.rgbBk = CLR_NONE;
  ildp.fStyle = ILD_TRANSPARENT;
  spiml-&gt;Draw(&amp;ildp);</font>
}

    ...
    if (SUCCEEDED(CoInitialize(NULL))) {/* In case we use COM */

        <font COLOR=blue>g_iImage = GetIconIndex(lpCmdLine);</font>

        ...
        <font COLOR=red>// no cleanup necessary</font>
        CoUninitialize();
    }
    ...
</pre>
<p>
This is how Explorer deals with icons most of the time.
It doesn't create actual icons;
it merely remembers indices into the system imagelist,
and when it needs to draw an icon,
it calls the <code>Draw</code> method on the imagelist whose
size corresponds to the image it wants.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
The system imagelists come in four sizes (as of this writing).
And yet
<i>large</i> is one of the smallest available ones.
Why is that?
</p>
<p>
The
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762185%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
system imagelist sizes</a>
are
</p>
<ul>
<li>Small
<li>Large
<li>Extra-Large
<li>Jumbo
</ul>
<p>
The first two (<i>small</i>
and <i>large</i>) were the only ones available in
Windows&nbsp;95.
Windows&nbsp;XP added a size larger than large,
which was named <i>extra-large</i>.
And then Windows Vista added another size even larger
than extra-large,
which I named <i>jumbo</i>.
</p>
<p>
It's an artifact of history that one of the smallest
icon sizes has the name <i>large</i>.
It was the largest icon size at the time,
but things got even larger since then.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: Icons generally don&#39;t look that good when scaled and if the DPI is high enough to warrant 24&#215;24 or 32&#215;32 icons in the title bar then you probably want larger icons in explorer as well. That customize classic theme metrics dialog gets more and more hidden in every version and while I use it to make scrollbars thinner I never change the title bar icon.</p>
<p>@What&#39;s next: Bitmap icons cannot be larger than 256&#215;256. The next step would probably be SVG.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>There were, at the time, a lot of nerds who want teeny-tiny title bars (because they don&#39;t want to waste screen space on nonclient pixels), but still have reasonable-sized small icons in the Explorer view (since that is client space). -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>USB suffered from the (IMO) even more confusing naming of Low/Full/Hi/Super speed where, unintuitively, Hi-speed is faster than Full speed. &nbsp;Full speed is about 1/23rd the speed of Hi; or 1/341st the speed of Super.</p>
<p>And I wonder what the USAF successor to the AAMRAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) will be? &nbsp;The &quot;Really Advanced&quot;, the &quot;More Advanced&quot;, the &quot;Next Gen&quot;? &nbsp;Looking back at naming schemes that didn&#39;t leave room to comfortably fit in future changes can be amusing.</p>

		<p>@Jon_S:</p>
<p>That seems to be what often happens when you reduce technical specifics into the soft fuzzy marketing language that gets printed on the box (or in the case of the AMRAAM, what gets printed on the congressman&#39;s 10-line executive summary). &nbsp;Though the Really Advanced missile might not be a bad idea: RAMRAAM :)</p>

		<p>Speaking of icons, is there some way to load the scaled versions of predefined icons (IDI_ASTERISK etc.) when running in non-default DPI modes? So far everything I tried always gave me 32&#215;32 icons.</p>

		<p>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why we have numbers. Indeed, instead of USB&#39;s confusing:</p>
<p>* Low</p>
<p>* Full</p>
<p>* Hi</p>
<p>* Super</p>
<p>We could have the clear:</p>
<p>* 1.5</p>
<p>* 12</p>
<p>* 480</p>
<p>* 3000 (or something like that)</p>
<p>Just make sure you define clearly what the numbers mean, otherwise you&#39;d end up like memory speeds, where the same unit can be described as either DDR2-800, PC2-6400 or 400MHz.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
