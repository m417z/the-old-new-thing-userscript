<p>On an internal distribution list
that a bunch of Microsoft bloggers hang out on,
somebody asked a question about how to accomplish X,
and another person suggested using the Y plug-in.
I replied to the thread by saying,
"The Y plug-in is not allowed on Microsoft-hosted properties
for legal reasons.
See this Web site for more information."

		<p>This is more like a thermonuclear fact delivered with regular social skills, though, so I&#8217;d invent another tag for the purpose.</p>

		<p>I rather enjoy the Thermonculear articles and was excited to see this one in the list today and simultaneously a little let down because it was so short. Personally I&#8217;d like to see more of these show up in the mix of topics.</p>

		<p>So, you&#8217;re saying that Raymond has the social skills of a thermonuclear device because he&#8217;s able to disappoint everyone when talking about his social skills of a thermonuclear device?</p>

		<p>I get that you&#8217;re hiding the identity of the Y plugin for reasons, so I&#8217;m not going to ask about that, but I am intrigued as to the nature of the legal reasons behind disallowing it. Is that also a deliberate elision, or can you elaborate on that at all? It is due to the licensing of Y (AGPL?), or the nationality of its authors (Russian, Chinese, Iranian?), or&#8230;?</p>

		<p>Mosr likely free only for non-commercial use, commercial requires special licence and associated fee.</p>

		<p>I really like programs/libraries that write &#8220;free&#8221; or &#8220;use at no cost&#8221; on their web page &#8211; and then add a &#8220;for personal use&#8221; in the EULA. The &#8220;better&#8221; ones give no indication of how to license for commercial use and/or don&#8217;t react when asked about it.</p>

		<p>If you want a new license on anything then any contact address you can find is good enough. If they don&#8217;t answer then it could just be that your email just went into the spam folder.</p>
<p>Most developers are clueless when it comes to licensing because most of the time nobody wants to license their stuff.</p>

		<p>I could be one incorporating some of Douglas Crockford&#8217;s code such as JSLint under the JSON license with the &#8220;The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.&#8221; clause. Contrary to IBM, I don&#8217;t think Microsoft has gotten an exemption for Microsoft &#8220;, its customers, partners, and minions, to use JSLint for evil.&#8221;.</p>

		<p>If X is something that can be programmed easily, I would always suggest doing so within a development environment, so the question here is also how hard it was for Microsoft of all companies to accomplish X.</p>

		<p>Is Microsoft a customer of IBM though? They must buy SOMETHING off them. Ergo, Microsoft is also allowed to do evil with JSON.</p>

		<p>Change job asap. Monkeys are usually not paid for fighting the good fight inside a bureaucratic megacorp. Either option (working with inefficient tools, or disobeying the policy) can only land you in trouble.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
