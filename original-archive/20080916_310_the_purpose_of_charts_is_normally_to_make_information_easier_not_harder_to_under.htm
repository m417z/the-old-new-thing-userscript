<p>In a presentation a few years ago, there was a pie chart, but not just any pie chart, but a pie chart that appeared to be specifically designed to convey no information whatsoever. (The presenter didn't realize this, of course, and probably thought it was awesomely cool.)</p>
<p> The pie chart consisted of five wedges, each of which was a slightly different shade of green. No, wait, that's not right. Each wedge was a <i>gradient</i> from a common shade of green to a slightly different shade of green for each wedge. Accompanying the chart was a legend that described what each shade of green represented. It was completely useless. (Inspired by this story, my friend <a href="http://wendyhome.com/"> ::&nbsp;Wendy&nbsp;::</a> created <a href="http://wendyhome.com/2007/09/07/excel-explains-5-drinkies-and-pies/"> her own monochromatic pie chart</a>.) </p>
<p> If you're going to make a chart with a legend, then the items labelled by the legend should be colors which are unlikely to be confused with each other. And for goodness' sake, don't make them all subtly different shades of the same base color. (For bonus points, consider the color-blind members of your audience. And for double bonus points, also consider the blind members of your audience. But that's another topic for another day.) </p>

		<p>There is an excellent monochromatic pie chart in Column 11 of Jon Bentley&#8217;s <em>More Programming Pearls</em>, one that might&#8217;ve pleased Henry Ford. The ACM Portal has it available for those with accounts.</p>

		<p>Sounds like someone who didn&#8217;t quite understand an Edward Tufte lecture. &nbsp;Tufte makes a point of using the &quot;smallest, effective difference&quot;. &nbsp;So rather than a rainbow of garish colors in the pie chart, he&#8217;d suggest using a palette with less diversity. &nbsp;(Actually, he&#8217;d probably tell you pie charts are junk.) &nbsp;Subtler differences between the wedge colors can make for a more pleasing chart, but they still need to be different enough to be &quot;effective&quot;. &nbsp;(And forget the stupid legend: Label the wedges directly!)</p>
<p>Of course, even Tufte takes things too far for my tastes. &nbsp;He showed an interesting map of ocean depths using a rainbow of colors. &nbsp;Then he replaced the palette with a range of blue shades. &nbsp;It was much subtler and easy to look at, but it completely obscured a set of undulations that had caught my eye in the original chart. &nbsp;And there was no way to find the measured depth by looking at the shades in the legend. &nbsp;Surrounding a patch of color with other shades of the same color influences your perception, making it difficult to impossible to match up the absolute shade to something in a legend.</p>

		<p>At the risk of spoiling an otherwise interesting whine, I should point out that the colors are generally not necessary; the wedges are usually arranged clockwise in descending order of size, with the largest wedge being just to the right of &quot;North&quot;. &nbsp;(The &quot;Other&quot; or &quot;Uncategorized&quot; wedge is always last, even if there are smaller wedges.)</p>
<p>Likewise, the legend is usually arranged in the same order as the wedges.</p>
<p>So unless there are a prohibitively large number of wedges, you don&#8217;t need the colors to read the graphs at all&#8230;</p>
<p>Finally, I should close by saying legends (whether color-coordinated or parallel-ordered) are generally inferior to putting the name of the wedge directly on the wedge itself.</p>

		<p>&quot;The purpose of charts is normally to make information easier, not harder, to understand&quot;</p>
<p>Not always. More often the purpose of a chart is to:</p>
<p>(a) Make the presenter look smart, or at least cool.</p>
<p>(b) Make the presenter&#8217;s product look better than the competition.</p>
<p>(c) Accentuate the positive and obfuscate the negative.</p>
<p>(d) Hide the fact that the presenter doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on.</p>

		<p>right, perhaps the presenter in fact obfuscated the chart on purpose. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been on the lookout of this since I discovered there is a book out there called &quot;How To Lie With Charts&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are these for?&quot;</p>
<p>&#8212; &quot;They&#8217;re pie charts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They&#8217;re all red.&quot;</p>

		<p>As previously noted, I think you grossly overestimate the benevolence of average presenters when it comes to making information easy to understand.</p>
<p>However, your point about color-blind people would lead to the conclusion that the ideal pie-chart would be *greyscale* (hopefully with sufficient variation to allow distinguishing the slices) &#8212; which undermines your point rather than reinforcing it.</p>
<p>I.e., an all-green pie chart with different green values would be *easier* for a red-green color-blind person to read than one which had red and green &nbsp;(and maybe even purple and orange) slices of similar &quot;darkness&quot;. </p>
<p>There are many kinds of color-blindness, but none that I know of cause the viewer to be unable to distinguish color value. </p>

		<p>Someone needs to get in touch with the Office team then.</p>
<p>In PowerPoint 2007, if you insert a chart or some SmartArt, for the one column of polychromatic Quick Styles, there are seven monochromatic ones, each solely tints of a different accent color and white.</p>

		<p>Ray T &#8211; Did you read Raymond&#8217;s explanation? It wasn&#8217;t several distinct shades of green for each wedge, it was a green-to-green gradient in each wedge. Any gradient is going to hinder comprehension, and trying to match gradients on a pie with gradients in a tiny square in the legend will be impossible. Probably a bar chart is more effective, because you don&#8217;t need to try to distinguish values by color.</p>

		<p>In response to earlier comments, and pie charts, Tufte comments in &quot;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information&quot; (paraphrasing): The only thing worse than a silly pie chart is several of them.</p>
<p>It can be well argued that a pie chart will never show information in an optimal way. &nbsp;Use a table or a column chart. &nbsp;With a column chart all the colors can be the same and it wouldn&#8217;t matter.</p>

		<p>You also shouldn&#8217;t do pie charts in pseudo-3D. The perspective distortion alone makes it hard for the audience to gauge the relative sizes of the segments.</p>
<p>If you absolutely must, only use a slight angle from &quot;straight down&quot;, not a really big angle as in that particularly bad linked-to example.</p>
<p>As others have pointed out, if your intention is to distort the data and confuse your audience, then 3D may be a good way to achieve that.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
