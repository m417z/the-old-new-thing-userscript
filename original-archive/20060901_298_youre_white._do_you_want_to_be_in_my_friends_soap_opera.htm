		<p>A similar thing happened to my uncle while touring China. &nbsp;He happened upon a director who cast him in a beer commercial (which was a good fit if you&#8217;re playing to stereotypes). &nbsp;The same directory then case him into a minor role in a miniseries as an American rocket scientist (which doesn&#8217;t fit at all). &nbsp;The miniseries was fantastically popular, leading the director to joke that my uncle had probably become the most-recognized American in China, even more than then-President Clinton.</p>

		<p>I grew up during part of my childhood in the Philippines. &nbsp;(My parents were missionaries.) &nbsp;It wasn&#8217;t uncommon for talent scouts to approach us children on the streets and try to cast us as the token foreigner in some Filipino movie. &nbsp;My blond brother, who spoke very good Tagalog, was especially sought after and actually starred opposite a Tagalog actor in a nationally released movie.</p>
<p>Imports work both ways, I guess. &nbsp;:-)</p>

		<p>Rather than saying &quot;a Mandarin-speaking American woman,&quot; you should say &quot;a Mandarin-speaking White American woman&quot; just like your precise headline. &nbsp;Otherwise, it looks as if you were assuming that American = White. &nbsp;Of course, I know it was just imprecise wording, not intentional&#8230;</p>

<p>hahaha.. are you kidding?

		<p>It&#8217;s European-American. &nbsp;Unless you&#8217;re not American. &nbsp;Saying someone is &quot;white&quot; is like saying someone is &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, or (whatever else there may be).</p>

		<p>How can an American who speaks Mandarin possibly be a stereotype?????</p>

		<p>If you say &quot;American who speaks Mandarin&quot; to me in the context of stereotypes, the one that comes to mind is the 1980s film bad guy &#8211; he was born in New York (or LA) to immigrant parents, he&#8217;s fought his way up to become a crime boss and he bribes all the local cops, but the hero has to take him down because he&#8217;s dealing drugs or has a really ugly tie. He looks Chinese and speaks Mandarin to his foot soldiers because it makes him an outsider so that viewers don&#8217;t cheer for him instead of the idiot hero.</p>
<p>In the context of Chinese stereotypes, I&#8217;m guessing the stereotypical American who speaks Mandarin is a white business person working for a US corporation in China, or the offspring of such a person. It&#8217;s easier to write this sort of sitcom material because even things too wildly implausible for a normal soap can be dismissed as &quot;those crazy foreigners&quot;.</p>
<p>Judging only from Raymond&#8217;s comment she probably has to power-dress, drop exagerated US slang into conversations and try to sleep her way to the top.</p>

		<p>&quot;It&#8217;s European-American.&quot; &#8211; I&#8217;m against this terminology, on the basis that it makes it sound like Europe is responsible for things like the Bushes, Barfield, Gaskins, Bundy and Fish. </p>
<p>Sure, we&#8217;ll hold our hands up and accept Mengele, Torquemada, Hitler, Mussolini, Mme Bathory, Caligula, Tiberius, Thatcher and Blair&#8230; yes, we&#8217;ll accept the blame for every one of these, but we have to draw the line somewhere. We weren&#8217;t responsible for Genghis Khan, and we won&#8217;t take your Bush! (And neither your Clintons, in case you think me partisan.)</p>

		<p>&quot;Foreign Babes in Beijing&quot; sounds more like a porno title than anything else. Is there something Ms. DeWoskin isn&#8217;t telling us?</p>

		<p>Dewi: &nbsp;If you&#8217;re seriously putting Bush up against &quot;Mengele, Torquemada, Hitler, Mussolini, &#8230;, Caligula, Tiberius&quot;, then I must say , I agree. you can&#8217;t have our Bush. &nbsp;He&#8217;s much too good for you.</p>

		<p>Virtually the same thing happened to me in Egypt. &nbsp;I am a white American who speaks Arabic. &nbsp;I was hooked in on the street because of my skin color and blonde hair, but cast later because of my ability to speak the language. &nbsp;I must say though, actually making movies and television shows is about as much fun as watching paint dry.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
