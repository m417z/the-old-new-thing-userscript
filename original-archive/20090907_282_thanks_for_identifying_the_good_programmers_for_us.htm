<p>Many years ago, my manager told me about a recruiting trip he made. In response to a large number of job applications submitted from a city where a major competing software company had its offices, a small group of Microsofties travelled to that city to interview those applicants and hold a mini-job fair, so that other interested parties could also show up and interview for positions.</p>
<p> When the company learned that Microsoft was coming to interview people, they called an emergency meeting which all their top programmers were required to attend, timing it to coincide with the job fair. The theory must have been that if their top programmers are at the emergency meeting, then they can't go to the job fair. Problem solved. </p>
<p> Well, except that the plan backfired. Sure, all the good programmers didn't come to the job fair, but it also told the interviewers which of the applicants were the good ones: They were the ones who didn't show up for their interviews! </p>

		<p>My company has done that several times in the past. Not really an emergency meeting, but a scheduled one that just happens to coincide exactly with a major job fair each year. Not surprisingly, when the date for that job fair suddenly changed one year, the date for our special meeting also magically changed for unknown reasons.</p>

		<p>But is that effective selection?</p>
<p>I mean&#8230; if some of those talented programmers really wants to go to Microsoft, even if the emergency meeting is there, they could just take *cough* sick leave *cough* so they could go&#8230;</p>
<p>An emergency meeting that&#8217;s sole purpose is to stop people go to interview seems to have very slim chance to stop people doing so&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Pax,</p>
<p>Of course &quot;rubbish&quot; and &quot;mandatory&quot; aren&#8217;t mutually exclusive. &nbsp;I suppose you could take the chance of not showing up, but then if Company X (Microsoft?) Chose not to hire you (even for legit reasons, like your background isn&#8217;t really in their plan) Company Y (Spacely&#8217;s Sprockets, perhaps?) decided to be petty and fire you for looking for other work, you&#8217;d be out of a job.</p>

		<p>Actually the good programmers were neither at the interviews nor the emergency meeting. People who have been in the industry for more than 17 minutes should know that emergency meetings are, by and large, utter rubbish.</p>
<p>By all means, send a sacrificial lamb to bring back the details. But keep in mind that 40 employees times a 1-hour emergency meeting is one **week** of lost time.</p>

		<p>@Danny, I suspect you were only kidding but in response to comments like these I&#8217;ve come up with the following rough filter for programmer &quot;3l33t3&quot;-ness:</p>
<p>Probability of person x being &quot;3l33t3&quot; is inversely proportional to the number of times they bash microsoft code.*</p>
<p>Come on, how many guys like Raymond Chen, Eric Lippert or Mark Russinovich do you think MS has to hire before they start producing top-notch code? &nbsp;Ditto for the old-timers you see in the articles reprinted in old copies of MSDN (e.g., Ruediger Asche). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course the sort of person that makes these kind of comments usually hasn&#8217;t read any of those MSDN oldies-but-goodies. &nbsp;Nor anything else that wasn&#8217;t in the first 5 hits of their solution-by-google-search method of programming.</p>
<p>*-filter is rough. &nbsp;interval resets every 12 months :)</p>

Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
