<p>If you itemize your taxes, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003577419_taxmonorail.html"> there are some taxes you can claim on Schedule&nbsp;A line&nbsp;7</a> that you may not be aware of.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seattle monorail tax ("Monorail") </li>
<li>Sound Transit tax ("RTA Tax") </li>
</ul>
<p> These taxes are special because they are based on the value of the vehicle and therefore qualify as a "personal property tax" from the IRS's point of view. </p>
<p> While you're on Schedule&nbsp;A, don't forget to <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=167605,00.html"> claim your deduction for state sales tax on line&nbsp;5</a>. You can look up the local sales tax rate for any Washington address by using <a href="http://gis.dor.wa.gov/taxratefinder/TaxFinder.htm?TaxType=S"> this handy web form on the State of Washington Department of Revenue</a> site. If you prefer doing it the slow way, you can <a href="http://dor.wa.gov/content/taxes/LocalSales_Use.aspx"> download all the local sales tax rates</a>. If you live in King County&dagger;, for example, the local rate is 1.9%, or 2.3% if you live in an RTA area. (That's in addition to the state-wide 6.5% rate.) </p>
<p> <b>Nitpicker's corner</b> </p>
<p> &dagger;That's King County, Washington, USA of course. I would have thought that was clear from context (it's the county that Seattle is a member of, and I've been talking about the state of Washington the whole time), but I can never tell with you folks. </p>

<p>Okay, but which planet are we referring to here? ;) Not being pedantic, just highlighting that nitpicking can go to ridiculous lengths &#8211; if they can&#8217;t work out context from something reasonably unambiguous, ignore them. To me and many others, I&#8217;m sure, we&#8217;d rather have you spend your time writing your excellent &amp; valuable blog than taking care of every nitpick.</p>

		<p>Yes! Ignore the nitpickers that have nothing better to do but miss the whole point of the post and instead focus on some pedantic little thing. Use the blinders. Otherwise you&#8217;ll just be dragged down to their level.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one thing I don&#8217;t miss about the days of my CS degree years ago. All the people that seemed to think the rest of the class thought they were soooo smart for finding a missing semicolon when the last 20 minutes were actually discussing some larger higher level design tradeoff.</p>

		<p>Or you can try the IRS&#8217;s calculator at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://apps.irs.gov/app/stdc/" rel="nofollow">http://apps.irs.gov/app/stdc/</a>. This has the advantage of calculating the proration if you have moved house during 2006. It shares with the state site the inability to find my house (the road has been there over a year but isn&#8217;t in GIS yet) and it requires reading popup help to determine which definition of income is used, but it&#8217;s otherwise pretty user-friendly.</p>
<p>If you bought a car/boat/etc, you may be able to add that to the standard deduction. If you want to be really slow, you can add up all the store receipts you kept for the entire year and use that number instead.</p>
<p>The above is only my opinion and should not be construed as actual tax advice.</p>

		<p>&lt;i&gt;While you&#8217;re on Schedule A, don&#8217;t forget to claim your deduction for state sales tax on line 5.&lt;/i&gt;</p>
<p>Just be warned that if you do this and if you get a state tax refund then you&#8217;ll have to declare that refund on your 2007 federal return so that the IRS can claw back the deduction next year. If you already have a larger-than-normal number of deductions for 2006 (say, if you just moved across the country or something) it actually might not be worth it; you just end up shifting a chunk of your tax burden forward a year.</p>
<p>Why yes, I did get burned by that particular snafu once, why do you ask?</p>

		<p>Yes, but Washington doesn&#8217;t have a state income tax, so if you live in Washington you can&#8217;t get burned by this snafu.</p>

<p>Sorry, I have to pick this nit: &nbsp;Only one pitcher is active there at a time. (To prevent the resultant nitpicking: &nbsp;normally active&#8230;) &nbsp;However, there can be, and often is, more than one nitpicker active at a time.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
