Today's Little Program tracks changs to the cursor.
You might want to do this as part of instrumentation,
in order to see how often the user is staring at an hourglass,
for example.
(It's easier to make the Move cursor appear on demand,
so I'll use that instead.)
</p>
<p>
The magic words here are
<code>OBJID_<wbr>CURSOR</code> and
<code>Get&shy;Cursor&shy;Info</code>.
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void log()
{
  CURSORINFO ci = { sizeof(ci) };
  GetCursorInfo(&amp;ci);
  printf("showing = %d, suppressed = %d, pos = (%d, %d), handle = %p\n",
    !!(ci.flags &amp; CURSOR_SHOWING),
    !!(ci.flags &amp; CURSOR_SUPPRESSED),
    ci.ptScreenPos.x,
    ci.ptScreenPos.y,
    ci.hCursor);
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>log</code> function prints information about the current
cursor.
For now, we just dump it to the screen,
but obviously you could do something fancier with it.
The <code>CURSOR_<wbr>SHOWING</code> flag tells you
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/17/9937972.aspx">
whether the cursor show count is nonnegative</a>,
which is what classically controls whether the cursor
is visible on the screen.
The <code>CURSOR_<wbr>SUPPRESSED</code> flag tells tells
you that nominally visible cursor is not visible to the user
because the user
touched the screen with a finger or pen.
</p>
<pre>
void CALLBACK WinEventProc(
  HWINEVENTHOOK hook,
  DWORD event,
  HWND hwnd,
  LONG idObject,
  LONG idChild,
  DWORD idEventThread,
  DWORD time)
{
  if (hwnd == nullptr &amp;&amp;
      idObject == OBJID_CURSOR &amp;&amp;
      idChild == CHILDID_SELF) {
    switch (event) {
    case EVENT_OBJECT_HIDE:
      printf("cursor hidden\n");
      log();
      break;
    case EVENT_OBJECT_SHOW:
      printf("cursor shown\n");
      log();
      break;
    case EVENT_OBJECT_NAMECHANGE:
      printf("cursor changed\n");
      log();
      break;
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
Our event hook procedure checks if we're being notified
about the cursor.
If so, then we print some information about the event we received,
and then log the cursor details.
</p>
<pre>
int __cdecl main(int, char**)
{
  printf("Move cursor = %p\n", LoadCursor(nullptr, IDC_SIZEALL));

  HWINEVENTHOOK hook = SetWinEventHook(
    EVENT_OBJECT_SHOW,
    EVENT_OBJECT_NAMECHANGE,
    nullptr,
    WinEventProc,
    GetCurrentProcessId(),
    GetCurrentThreadId(),
    WINEVENT_OUTOFCONTEXT);

  MessageBox(nullptr, TEXT("Press Ok when bored"),
             TEXT("Title"), MB_OK);

  UnhookWinEvent(hook);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
Our main program prints the handle of the Move cursor,
just to demonstrate that the handle will match the output.
Next, it installs the event hook on its own process and thread.
(If you want to monitor the entire process, then pass
0 for the thread ID.
If you wanted to monitor all processes
on the desktop, then pass 0 for both the process ID
and thread ID.)
Next, we display a message box to give you a way
to exit the program, and to fire up a message pump.
After you are bored, we remove the hook and exit.
</p>
<p>
Now, I chose the Move cursor because it is pretty much
the only cursor you can get to from a message box:
Press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd>,
then hit <kbd>M</kbd> for Move.
Bingo, a Move cursor.
And you can see the program spit out the new cursor handle,
and it should match the value printed at the start of the program.</p>

		<p>&gt;The CURSOR_SUPPRESSED flag tells tells you that the cursor is not visible because the user touched the screen with a finger or pen.</p>
<p>Unreliable. I tried touching my 19&quot; Dell monitors with both my fingers and pens, but the cursor remained visible. (Walking myself over to nit-picker&#39;s corner&#8230;..)</p>

		<p>@Brian_EE, doubling down on the nit-picking&#8230; Raymond didn&#39;t say that the cursor will always become hidden when you touch the screen, or that CURSOR_SUPPRESSED will always be set if the cursor is hidden (though both those things might still be true)&#8230; he just said that if CURSOR_SUPPRESSED is set, then the cursor is hidden because the user touched the screen. Your counter-example doesn&#39;t disprove that statement. See also the Wason selection task (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Wason_selection_task</a>).</p>

		<p>@Chris Long &#8211; I guess these days everyone is so used to devices having touchscreens that one doesn&#39;t think to differentiate that and instead uses the generic &quot;screen&quot; term. Related to that, my college professor fianc√© has been lamenting that you can&#39;t find a decent new laptop without a touchscreen. Although I haven&#39;t done any analysis of my own, she claims the touchscreens aren&#39;t as bright as the regular LCD screens.</p>

		<p>Ah, I see I missed the sarcasm in your comment&#8230; oops. You got me :-)</p>
<p>I can confirm that touching my 21&quot; Sony screen from circa 2004 doesn&#39;t hide the cursor either.</p>

		<p>When I touch my HP w1907 screen at the cursor position, the cursor becomes occluded by the thumb and thus invisible. How did you manage to touch the screen but not occlude the cursor?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if there was a CURSOR_SUPPRESSED message when I touched the screen but it may very well be.</p>

		<p>@Sven2 &#8211; Were you running the hook program at the time ?</p>
<p>Reading Raymond&#39;s explanation I would expect the CURSOR_SUPPRESSED flag to be set if you occluded the cursor with your finger or a pen. &nbsp;Perhaps you didn&#39;t completely occlude the cursor.</p>
<p>However, I notice that you mention you were testing with your thumb, which being neither a finger nor a pen you would not reasonably expect to result in the flag being set, whether or not you have occluded the cursor.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
