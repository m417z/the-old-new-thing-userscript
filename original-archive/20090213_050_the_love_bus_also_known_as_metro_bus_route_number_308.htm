<p>Four years ago, Troy Kleweno spotted Christine Hsieh on <a href="http://transit.metrokc.gov/cftemplates/show_map.cfm?BUS_ROUTE=308&amp;DAY_NAV=W"> the 308 bus</a>. He saw her twice a day, once in the morning on the way to work, and again in the evening on the way home. His co-workers teased him about the "bus girl" he pined after for six months before he finally <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004353134_webbusproposal16m.html"> said hello</a>. That led to a date, and soon they were a couple.</p>
<p> It's only fitting then that when Troy decided that  it was time to propose marriage, that he do it <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/kcdot/news/2008/nr080416_lovebus.htm"> on the 308 bus</a>. <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/kcdot/news/videos/2008/041608_308proposal.htm"> Watch it here</a>. </p>

		<p>Ah yes, Valentines Day. &nbsp;Our annual reminder of how shallow and fickle women are (and their total domination over men). &nbsp;Can we please get rid of these fake holidays? &nbsp;I&#8217;m not bitter&#8230;</p>

		<p>I suppose that once upon a time Valentines day was fun and perhaps romantic. Today it&#8217;s just another commercial event dedicated to helping you get rid of your money.</p>

		<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but public proposals rub me the wrong way. &nbsp;It puts too much pressure on the proposee.</p>

		<p>re: Maurits</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe I should re-think my plan to propose to someone in the comments section of The Old New Thing.</p>

		<p>Maurits: You should only propose in public if you&#8217;re 100% the person is going to say yes.

		<p>If she&#8217;s dropping hints that hey, marriage is awesome, have you ever thought about marrying sometime? GEE IT SURE WOULD BE NICE TO BE MARRIED then you&#8217;re probably safe to propose in public.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s always important to preface any wedding proposal with an assertion that you&#8217;re not a terrorist.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
