<p>Here's a customer question:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> I've put data on the clipboard as delay-rendered, but I'm getting a <code>WM_RENDERFORMAT</code> request for my <code>CF_HDROP</code> for many operations even though nobody actually looks at the files. Operations such as right-clicking a blank space on the desktop or opening the Edit menu. I don't want to render the data until the user hits Paste because generating the data requires me to download the file from a Web server. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The <code>CF_HDROP</code> format is a list of file names, and at the time the format is generated, the files must already exist. That's because the whole purpose of <code>CF_HDROP</code> is to describe files that already exist. </p>
<p> These simple operations cause a request for <code>CF_HDROP</code> because, as a simple list of file names, it is expected to be a fast format. The data object merely has to provide a list of things that already exist; it doesn't have to go make them. It's interesting that the customer wants to delay generating the <code>CF_HDROP</code> format until the user selects Paste, because the shell is asking for <code>CF_HDROP</code> specifically to see whether it should enable the Paste command in the first place! </p>
<p> That you shouldn't generate dynamic data in response to <code>CF_HDROP</code> is also clear when you think about the lifetime issues. If you're going to generate the files on the fly, when do you know that it's safe to delete them? If the user drops the file onto Internet Explorer or Firefox, the Web browser is going to view the file as a Web page. You get no notification when the user closes the Web browser, and therefore you don't know when it's safe to delete the file. The <code>CF_HDROP</code> format describes files that already exist independent of the data object. </p>
<p> What is the correct thing to do if you want to delay-render a virtual file? Use the FileGroupDescriptor clipboard format. That's what it's for: Delay-rendering of virtual file contents. </p>
<p> (I'm assuming an advanced audience that knows how to use a FileGroupDescriptor. There will be a remedial course in the use of the FileGroupDescriptor sometime next year.) </p>

<p>Because Raymond reserves the right to insert new topics in the middle of the topic queue as he sees fit &#8212; thus making anything more precise than &quot;sometime next year&quot; impossible to predict.</p>

		<p>For the impatient, the relevant MSDN article to get you started with FileGroupDescriptor seems to be:</p>

		<p>I agree: there&#8217;s no reason to use delayed rendering if it&#8217;s a format that is cheap to produce in the first place (in terms of time and memory). &nbsp;Save Delayed Rendering for expensive formats with a low probability of use, such as Bitmap from a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>OTOH, there is WAY too much clipboard monitoring going on. &nbsp;Programs spy on the clipboard, performing a full-blown paste (even if it&#8217;s not apparent to the user) just to light up their &quot;paste&quot; buttons and menus. &nbsp;Excessive, and invasive clipboard monitoring by programs that aren&#8217;t expected to be clipboard monitors, leads to lots of trouble for everyone.</p>

<p>I dont know what FileGroupDescriptor is, but I can imagine what it is, and I&#8217;m looking forward to additional &quot;under cover&quot; info.</p>
<p>Your post was very useful anyway, thanks.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
