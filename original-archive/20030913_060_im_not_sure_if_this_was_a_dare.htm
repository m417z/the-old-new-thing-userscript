<p>         <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/">Joe Beda</a> stopped by my office, clutching         a stack of documents he had just had notarized, and told me, "Raymond, you should         become a notary public."      </p>
<p>         "Why?"      </p>
<p>         "It'd be fun."      </p>
<p>         "Notarizing documents is fun?"      </p>
<p>         "No, just <u>being</u> a notary public - just knowing that you had the power to notarize         documents - would be fun. Besides, you'd be good at it, since you're such a stickler         for the rules. I wonder what the qualifications for being a notary public are, anyway."      </p>
<p>         So I went and looked up <a href="http://www.dol.wa.gov/unfc/notfront.htm">the process         of becoming a notary public in the State of Washington</a>.      </p>
<p>     The requirements are deceptively simple: Ability to execute the duties of a notary     public (and indeed, requirement to perform said duties upon demand), a $10,000 surety     bond, a clean criminal record, and three character references who will affirm that     I am "a person of good moral character". That last one might be tricky.  </body></p>

		<p>I looked it up in my state at some point, because it does sound neat to have that ability.  Easy, except that I&#8217;ve got plenty of other things to put $10,000 towards. ;)</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s much easier in Tx&#8230; when I got my notary certificate 2 years ago, all I needed to do was pay $75 to the state and send in a form that was notarized by someone else where I swore that I was not a criminal. No bond is required either&#8230; though, it is surely a good idea to have one backing you up. You don&#8217;t want to end up getting sued for doing something wrong! I&#8217;d say go for it&#8230; people give you a lot of respect when they find out you&#8217;re a notary.</p>

		<p>$10,000?  It&#8217;s much easier in NY.  I looked it up recently, having had the epiphany that it would be fun to be a notary public &#8211; just knowing that I had the power to notarize documents would be cool.  I like your friend.</p>
<p>In any case, it&#8217;s easy in NY.  You pass an exam, pay a $60 fee, and voila!  For $60, it&#8217;s probably worth it, though I wouldn&#8217;t put down $10,000 for it.</p>

		<p>I think there might be easier ways, too.  When I worked at a credit union, I don&#8217;t think the notories needed the $10,000 bond &#8211; I think the credit union covered it.  But that *would* explain why they regulated the number of them pretty closely.  </p>
<p>I wanted to be a notary, but :: sniff :: they would only let me be a lowly teller (well, they let me train employees and be the computer specialist, but no notary for me).</p>
<p>Which is probably why I defected&#8230;  :: cough ::  </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
