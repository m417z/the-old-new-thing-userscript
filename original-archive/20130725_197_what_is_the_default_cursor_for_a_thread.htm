When we looked at
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/21/1115695.aspx">
the process by which the cursor is set</a>,
we neglected to discuss the case where
<i>nobody bothers to set the cursor</i>.
What is the ultimate default cursor?
</p>
<p>
Let's write a program that refuses to set the cursor.
Take
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
the scratch program</a>
and add these lines:
</p>
<pre>
BOOL OnSetCursor(HWND hwnd, HWND hwndCursor,
                 UINT codeHitTest, UINT msg)
{
  return TRUE;
}

   HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_SETCURSOR, OnSetCursor);
</pre>
<p>
What we did was make the window explicitly refuse to set
the cursor by making it do nothing and return <code>TRUE</code>,
which means,
"It's all good. I set the cursor!"
(Liar, liar, pants on fire.)
</p>
<p>
Run this program, move the cursor over the window, and what do you get?
</p>
<p>
The hourglass.
</p>
<p>
Now, this is clearly some sort of pathological case,
where there is a thread that covers its ears and hums
whenever the window manager asks it to specify
a cursor.
But you can end up in this case unintentionally,
and in fact there's a good chance that you've seen it happen.
Just write an application that blocks the UI thread during startup.
Take a fresh scratch program and add a different line of code:
</p>
<pre>
        ShowWindow(hwnd, nShowCmd);

        <font COLOR=blue>Sleep(5000);</font>

        while (GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
            TranslateMessage(&msg);
            DispatchMessage(&msg);
        }
</pre>
<p>
Here, we're simulating a program that hangs its UI thread
during initialization.
During that initial five-second delay,
the program has yet to pump any messages,
so it hasn't yet received the
<code>WM_<wbr>MOUSE&shy;MOVE</code> or
<code>WM_<wbr>NC&shy;MOUSE&shy;MOVE</code>
message
that would normally trigger the
<code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;CURSOR</code> message.
All the window manager can do is show the default cursor.
</p>
<p>
That's why the default cursor is an hourglass.</p>

		<p>Yeah, the term &quot;hourglass&quot; is one of those misnomers now, it&#39;s technically the wait cursor (IDC_WAIT or Cursors.WaitCursor for .NET types like myself). The Mouse control panel also calls it the busy cursor.</p>

		<p>kinokijuf: Because it looks good. &nbsp;And when people got Vista nobody complained about the new cursor scheme, so was apparently visually intuitive too.</p>
<p>Henke37: Even if it was, they could just go ahead and change it to whatever they wanted. &nbsp;And, in fact, I think everyone I knew pre-Vista called it the &#39;hourglass&#39;. &nbsp;Seems like you are talking about either the macro that refers to it or the control panel name for it, in which case I retort with a previous article! &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/05/07/10416464.aspx">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/10416464.aspx</a></p>

		<p>Muzer: Touché (or however it&#39;s spelt, only hear it said).</p>
<p>But I think that&#39;s more important when trying to talk to a user about an important application (like the taskbar). &nbsp;I suppose if I was talking to a user about this stuff I&#39;d say the &#39;busy cursor&#39; because that describes it perfectly (and according to Miff that&#39;s actually its God-given name). &nbsp;Maybe the linked article would have been a more appropriate retort to someone calling it the &#39;wait&#39; cursor, although not so much since it&#39;s still obvious what that means (unlike NT 6.2, for instance).</p>
<p>I actually go ahead and suggest calling it the &#39;busy&#39; cursor is good practise because it&#39;s always good practise to use the same terminology that your users will use.</p>

		<p>Indeed. I&#39;ve always called it the busy cursor (and that&#39;s what it is (used to be) labelled as in the GUI). I do pretty much agree with you ;)</p>

		<p>Actually I just double-checked by bringing up Control Panel and it might actually be better to refer to the cursor as the pointer because that&#39;s what it&#39;s called there. &nbsp;This is probably a good idea, since a cursor is anything that hovers and is used to mark a position, such as the line cursor when you type.</p>

<p>The documentation for LoadCursor officially defines IDC_WAIT with a note that says Hourglass.

		<p>Why is there a WM_SETCURSOR message in the first place? Why not just keep a cursor reference associated with the window and only change it when explicitly requested (like it is done in almost all modern GUI frameworks)?</p>

<p>I see. &nbsp;Perhaps the magic filter didn&#39;t like the hyperlink I included, but whatever the cause a filter that deletes comments without interaction or notification seems to be a pretty poor design &#8212; or at least a good way to curb commenting. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think this used to be a problem; you might consider it off if you&#39;re able.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
