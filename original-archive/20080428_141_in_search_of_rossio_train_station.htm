<p>While wandering around the central Lisbon area, I remember walking past an ornate building that had people streaming out of it. As I neared the entrance, I realized, "Oh, it's the train station."</p>
<p> And then some days later, I wanted to catch the train to Sintra, but forgot exactly where the Rossio Train Station was. "It's at the south end of this square, or was it that square? I remember it was on the right hand side as you head south..." </p>
<p> The guide book said that it was right off of Rossio Square, but it's a big square, and, truth be told, I had all my squares confused for a long time. I mistook the neighboring Pra&ccedil;a da Figueira for Rossio Square because the first time I got off the Metro at the Rossio stop, I emerged in that square. From then on, I was disoriented without even realizing it. </p>
<p> I popped into a clothing store on (the real) Rossio Square and asked the young woman working there if she could tell me where the train station was. My Portuguese is of course effectively nonexistent (save for the social niceties like <i lang="pt">Ol&aacute;</i> and <i lang="pt">Obrigado</i>), but the guide book did have a picture of the train station. It didn't help. She didn't know where the train station was. </p>
<p> Turns out the train station was just a few steps away. So much for asking the locals how to get around. </p>
<p> The Rossio Train Station is off the northwest corner of the square, on the tiny street connecting Rossio to Restauradores. In fact, the closest Metro stop to the Rossio Train Station is not Rossio; it's Restauradores. </p>

		<p>Hello, Raymond.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been following with interest your posts regarding your visit to my hometown.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed your trip to Sintra, truly a wonderful place. About the Rossio train station, it is also particular for its 100-year-old tunnel, linking the railway to the city center. It&#8217;s a great work of engineering for something that old.</p>

		<p>You need to play more Doom! &nbsp;Once you get used to staggering around computer mazes that all seem to look alike, you start to get a nack for navigating.</p>

		<p>Heh, I recently got lost quite foolishly. I needed to be somewhere quite close to Shimo-Kitazawa (Tokyo), a neighbourhood I&#8217;m reasonably familiar with but this was in an area I didn&#8217;t often visit.</p>
<p>My instructions were quite simple: from the station&#8217;s exit, right at the railroad crossing, left at the Lawson (convenience store), second right etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I used the wrong exit, turned right at the railroad crossing on the wrong railroad track (Shimo-Kitazawa is where the Keio Inokashira line and the Odakyu line), and unfortunately there was also a Lawson in that street so I ended up going in completely the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Via a long detour, I ended up at Shin-Daita, a station on the Inokashira line to the west of Shimo-Kitazawa (and I needed to be on the south-east side!) so I decided to take a train back to Shimo-Kitazawa and try again&#8230; I didn&#8217;t really realize how this could&#8217;ve happened until I checked Google maps. :S</p>

		<p>Indeed. &nbsp;IRL, I&#8217;m always getting lost, even in &quot;non-losable&quot; situations like driving home from work. &nbsp;Doom helped quite a bit. &nbsp;Probably that part of the brain that registers ordering of locations, which seems to be my main problem.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
