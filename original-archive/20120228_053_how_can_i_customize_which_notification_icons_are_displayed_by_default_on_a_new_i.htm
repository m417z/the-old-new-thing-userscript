<p>Windows&nbsp;7 provides a new Unattended Windows Setup setting known as <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff716429%28WS.10%29.aspx"> NotificationArea</a>. This setting lets you replace the default <i>Action Center</i> and <i>Battery</i> icons with two icons of your choosing.</p>
<p> To specify the replacement icons, you need to provide the path to the application which is providing the replacement icon, and you need the GUID for the replacement icon. </p>
<p> The path you know how to get, because it's where the application was installed. (Note that the application must also be signed.) </p>
<p> But where do you get the GUID from? </p>
<p> The GUID is provided by the application as part of the programmatic interface to the notification area. When the application creates its notification icon, it passes a structure known as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb773352.aspx"> <code>NOTIFY&shy;ICON&shy;DATA</code></a>, and one of the fields in that structure is the <code>guidItem</code>. If an application fills in the <code>guidItem</code> and sets the <code>NIF_GUID</code> flag, then that is telling the taskbar (among other things), "Hey, if an unattended setup file specifies this GUID as a replacement icon, <i>that's me</i>." </p>
<p> Okay, that says where GUIDs are programmatically specified, but where you do you, the system administrator, get the GUID from? </p>
<p> You get them by asking the application author, "Hi, we want to specify that your notification icon is displayed by default in Windows&nbsp;7. Can you please tell us what GUID you are using for your notification icon?" </p>
<p> Given that application authors are <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/01/922449.aspx"> always angling for a bonus</a>, they will probably be more than happy to tell you how to give their icon more guaranteed face-time with the user. </p>
<p> This setting was originally designed for customization by computer manufacturers, and computer manufacturers will probably have a pretty close relationship with the companies that provide shov^H^H^H^Hvalue-added software for their systems. </p>

		<p>@asf: In this particular case, you can inject a new root certificate and sign with that. Normally I would not advocate such behavior but Microsoft continues to be stupid in this regard.</p>

		<p>@Tyler are you implying that signed software can&#39;t be shitty and crash, or even that it is less shitty on average? Signed only means they paid to have someone say &quot;Yes, this app was compiled by Asus&quot; (I have plenty of signed software showing weird messages in Engrish).</p>
<p>(@Raymond Why would a computer manufacturer include malware in the first place? Can&#39;t they inject a new certificate? Isn&#39;t malware as profitable as normal-ware?)</p>
<p>I was going to say here that maybe Microsoft could enforce a mandatory &quot;Windows Software Certification&quot; for included &quot;value-added software&quot; (it&#39;s mandatory for hardware after all).</p>
<p>And by the way, when I had the pleasure of having to reinstall Windows 7 in my Asus computer (using the built-in recovery partition), I could see what I assume must be the &quot;Unattended Windows Setup&quot;: a large white semitransparent window covering the whole desktop saying &quot;System setup in progress-please do not touch&quot; while setup assistants frantically appeared and disappeared in the background (as if it was all being done with emulated keypresses and mouse clicks). I wanted to record the whole process: it was like watching a Lego machine moving and sorting balls around (e.g. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://youtu.be/N9VBQ3hW6t8" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/N9VBQ3hW6t8</a>) at high speed, all while hoping that none of the balls fall out of the tracks (not that I am implying that it could have failed â€” I know it was 100% robust software that could never go wrong due to a very small unpredicted circumstance). The whole process took at least 20 reboots and used to apparently halt for a minute or two every now and then.</p>

		<p>Does anything about this post mention anything having to be signed? You need the GUID that the app uses to create the icon. Anyone can make a GUID for free. No one pays Verisign anything.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m hoping it just needs a valid signature from a certificate from a trusted issuer, like the rest of Windows, rather than stipulating one particular CA as with the bizarre Winqual hoop.</p>
<p>[Are you suggesting that the price isn&#39;t high enough to dissuade malware authors from applying for a certificate? -Raymond]</p>
<p>It&#39;s high enough to be an irritant to non-commercial developers, but I doubt it&#39;s a significant issue for malware authors. Having said that, the money isn&#39;t the big barrier, but the refusal to sell to individual developers &#8211; a policy Verisign seem to have reversed now, so fingers crossed for my own application!</p>

		<p>But I don&#39;t want to replace. I want to *add* and still make sure they don&#39;t get hidden as they do by default upon manual installation. Especially some icons which repeatedly get hidden even after setting them to always show icon and notification.</p>

		<p>@Colin: My guess is that you would just have two less &quot;promoted&quot; icons in the notification area. After all, you can always customize the notifications if you don&#39;t like what&#39;s there.</p>

<p>True: you are also unlikely to be a malware developer, though, which is why I thought this aspect was broader than notification icons. (The signing requirement here isn&#39;t to ensure that if an OEM starts bundling malware that malware doesn&#39;t get a promoted notification area icon!). Also, OEMs are not the only users of unattended installations; corporate, academic and even individual users go this route too. Of course if you&#39;re customising the system installation, you could presumably add and use your own root CA anyway.</p>
<p>Signing in itself isn&#39;t an unreasonable requirement &#8211; I sign my own software, using a Startcom certificate at present (seeing a lawyer on Monday to get a Verisign one).</p>

		<p>Another reason we implemented the signing requirement is so that apps could not spoof other apps&#39; TN icons/promo state. This becomes especially interesting when a certain ISV decides to switch their app from wow64 to native x64, or just updates their version number (which they happen to use in their folder name under &quot;Program Files&quot;) and wants TN icon promotion state to &quot;continue working&quot; (i.e. if the user selected &quot;show in notification area&quot; for the wow64 app, keep the setting for the new version). In SP1 onwards, you can &quot;spoof&quot; your own TN icon if the new app is signed by the same Publisher.</p>

Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
