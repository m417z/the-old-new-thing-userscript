<p>In the initial designs for the Start menu, the list of most-frequently-used programs on the Start menu would be completely empty the first time you opened it. This was perfectly logical, since you hadn't run any programs at all yet, so nothing was frequently-used because nothing had been used at all! Perfectly logical and completely stupid-looking.</p>
<p> Imagine the disappointment of people who just bought a computer. They unpack it, plug everything in, turn it on, everything looks great. Then they open the Start menu to start using their computer and they get... a blank white space. "Ha-ha! This computer can't do anything! You should have bought a Mac!" </p>
<p> (In usability-speak, this is known as "the cliff": You're setting up a new computer, everything looks like it's going great, and then... you're staring at a blank screen and have no idea what to do next. The learning curve has turned into a precipice.) </p>
<p> The original design attempted to make this initially-blank Start menu less stark by adding text that said, roughly, "Hey, sure, this space is blank right now, but as you run programs, they will show up here, trust me." </p>
<p> Great work there. Now it's not stupid any more. Now it's stupid and ugly. </p>
<p> It took a few months to figure out how to solve this problem, and ultimately we decided upon what you see in Windows&nbsp;XP: For brand new users, we create some "artificial points" so that the initial Start menu has a sampling of fun programs on it. The number of artificial points is carefully chosen so that they are enough points to get the programs onto the Start menu's front page, but not so many points that they overwhelm the "real" points earned by programs users run themselves. (I believe the values were chosen so that a user needs to run a program only twice to get it onto the front page on the first day.) </p>
<p> Note that these "artificial points" are not given if the user was upgraded from Windows&nbsp;2000. In that case, the points that the Windows&nbsp;2000 Start menu used for Intellimenus were used to seed the Windows&nbsp;XP point system. In that way, the front page of the Start menu for an upgraded uses already reflects the programs that the user ran most often on Windows&nbsp;2000. </p>
<p> In the initial release of Windows&nbsp;XP, the "artificial points" were assigned so that the first three of the six slots on the most-frequently-used programs list were chosen by Windows and the last three by the computer manufacturer. If your copy of Windows&nbsp;XP was purchased at retail instead of preinstalled by the computer manufacturer, or if the computer manufacturer declined to take advantage of the three slots offered to it (something that never happened in practice), then Windows took two of the three slots that had been offered to the computer manufacturer, leaving the last slot blank. That way, the very first program you ran showed up on your Start menu immediately. </p>
<p> In Windows&nbsp;XP Service Pack&nbsp;1, the assignment of the six slots changed slightly. Two of the slots were assigned by Windows, one by the United States Department of Justice, and the last three by the computer manufacturer. (Again, if you bought your copy of Windows&nbsp;XP at retail, then two of the computer manufacturer slots were assigned by Windows and the last was left blank.) </p>

		<p>Sounds like a very reasonable solution.</p>
<p>Rejected heuristics include:</p>
<p>&#8211;Choose the first 6 .exe files alphabetically from windowssystem32</p>
<p>&#8211;Search the hard drive for all .exe files and randomly choose 6 of them. &quot;Lucky! You got Minesweeper! All I got was &#8216;Explorer&#8217;!&quot;</p>
<p>&#8211;Use the same 6 programs as were on the build machine. &quot;What&#8217;s &#8216;Visual Studio&#8217; doing on my Start menu, and why doesn&#8217;t it work?&quot;</p>

		<p>I always wondered how those programs got on the start menu right after a fresh install. It wasn&#8217;t a problem, I just thought it was hard-coded (in a way it was &#8211; except for the oem ones &#8211; I never saw those). It is really interesting to see how it did take care of the artifical pointing too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wondered how the start menu did its thing &#8211; I must say I&#8217;ve loved this series of posts. Thanks Raymond!</p>

		<p>While having defaults is not a bad idea, I think the reasoning behind it is flawed. If a new user unpacks their PC and is dependent on the Freq. Used Program section of the start menu to use their computer, then having defaults isn&#8217;t likely to help them much at all. They are already grossly undertrained on using Windows. If MS felt that the user would be lost, default programs isn&#8217;t going to give them a clue. Just pointing out strange reasoning to a fairly acceptable solution.</p>

		<p>Joe, the user can start out using the default programs until they get the courage to spelunk into the greater Start Menu. Because their mouse has to pass over the greater Start Menu on the way to the default programs, they will do it sooner or later.</p>

		<p>I am intrigued by the Start menu of a computer which was installed from a custom-made Windows XP CD. I can pin items to the top area, but no item makes it to the &quot;point&quot; area. There is space for them (probably because the right side of the Start menu is tall enough), and &quot;Number of Programs on Start menu&quot; is definitely larger than zero and than the pinned part count. Any solution to get the &quot;point area&quot; functionality back?</p>

		<p>This behavior has always looked very natural to me. You just install XP, of course it&#8217;s going to show off what it has (movie maker, etc). Also, they took care for these programs to have nice icons, so the default Start menu looks nice.</p>
<p>And again, for me the Vista instant search thing makes all of this irrelevant. Who cares about the menu, I type what I think and get it!</p>

		<p>The USDOJ-placed shortcut that Raymond is referring to is the &#8220;Set Program Access and Defaults&#8221;, though saying that the slot was &#8220;assigned &nbsp;by the USDOJ&#8221; sounds a bit disingenuous to me.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Set Program Access and Defaults&#8221; &#8216;feature&#8217; was added as part of the settlement in the antitrust matter. The icon was originally placed in the &#8220;Programs&#8221; submenu of the &#8220;Start Menu&#8221;. In 2003, Microsoft moved it to the location in which it currently resides, and stated that they were doing so out of a &#8220;spirit of cooperation&#8221;. </p>
<p>Saying that the DOJ got to choose the positioning of the icon, to me, sounds like nothing more than whining about being found guilty of being an illegal monopoly.</p>

		<p>I think &lt;voice persona=&quot;Agent Smith&quot;&gt;Mr Anderson&lt;/voice&gt; is a little harsh there. &nbsp;I read it as typical Raymond Chen humour, dry as the Gobi Desert with a touch of cheekiness, as if daring the loser contingent to take offence, yet again.</p>
<p>Mind you, my first thought was that the menu item was for the mind-control rays that the US government is using to control people. &nbsp;Thank the gods for my tinfoil hat, is all I can say!</p>

		<p>In my opinion, the entire idea of this start menu start page is wrong, so I&#8217;m surprised to see so much written about it. &nbsp;I&#8217;m very scared that people would try to apply this to something else.</p>
<p>This post infers to me that the people hadn&#8217;t thought of the first-start experience, which makes me ask, what, then, did they think about? &nbsp;It seems they had an implementation idea, then kept patching up to adapt to the needs they discovered afterwards.</p>
<p>The problem that I have with the interface is that programs show up there, and disappear, and the user is not taugh where these programs are located. It adds confusion to the user interface by showing the same things slightly differently in two places.</p>
<p>On the Mac, people are acquainted very early on with going in the &#8216;Application&#8217; folder to find the applications. &nbsp;IMHO It&#8217;s much more valuable to do this, user-interaction wise, than to work out a system that appears to me to be a shortcut for power users, which tries to masquerades as ease-of-use.</p>
<p>Another thing that Mac people have done is implemented Bundles, which makes applications be one icon instead of a folder of files. &nbsp;This solution would completely transform the &quot;Program File&quot; folder and the Start menu, which both have too many folders or sub-menus because Bundles are not available.</p>

		<p>But Ulric, people have to run the programs the first time somehow. As mentioned in the post, if you&#8217;ve never used XP the start menu panel gets filled up with &#8216;welcome to Windows&#8217; type programs. So people have to find the programs they want to use in the Start Menu, or on the Desktop, and run it about twice, and then it&#8217;ll start showing up.</p>
<p>Anyway, Macs can hardly talk about user interface issues that seemed like a good idea at the time. Putting a CD in the Trash to eject it is just as confusing as some of the strange things Windows does.</p>

		<p>&quot;This post infers to me that the people hadn&#8217;t thought of the first-start experience, which makes me ask, what, then, did they think about?&quot;</p>
<p>Where did you infer that from?</p>
<p>From the text above, &quot;&#8217;It took a few months to figure out how to solve this problem, and ultimately we decided upon what you see in Windows XP: &#8230; &#8216;, I think it shows that they put at the minimum three months of thought into it.</p>
<p>I think the education with &quot;Where are my programs?&quot; is pretty quick with the annoying highlighted new program bars. The only problem I could guess at is that moving the shortcuts for them around, or completely off of the menu list is too easy, and may be done by mistake.</p>

		<p>Dear Raymond,</p>
<p>Seems my comment publish only partially. Remove the first one. I shall re-post it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve one question regarding the items in the start menu, If I pin an item in the start menu, why it&#8217;s showing the same item which I&#8217;ve already pinned to start menu.</p>
<p>See the screenshot &#8211; <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://urltea.com/sp6" rel="nofollow">http://urltea.com/sp6</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s showing two links to Safari Browser in the pinned item list and the recent items. Is it really makes any sense?</p>

		<p>The first thing *I* do after getting a new computer (or helping someone set up a new computer) is ask them if they plan to use me for support. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of my parents, I know the answer is yes!</p>
<p>Then I uninstall the 5 or 6 background tasks that the OEM has installed, and edit the registry to remove the entry from the right-hand column of the start menu (usually near the bottom) that says &quot;get help from the OEM&quot;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This entry doesn&#8217;t seem to have a documented way of removing it.</p>

		<p>@Sarath:</p>
<p>Did you pin it from the icon in the mru list? If not, it might simply have a different command to start Safari.</p>
<p>If you did, maybe it will go away off the MRU list after a while, since it gathers no more points (I don&#8217;t think the points are reset if an item is pinned while already on the MRU)</p>

		<p>The idea that the USDOJ got to choose any icons on my computer for me at all is repulsive and unacceptable. &nbsp;I pay serious tax dollars every year and all I have to show for it are highschools that still suck and an icon on my start menu that I didn&#8217;t ask for.</p>
<p>Thanks slashdotters and Uncle Sam, you did me a great service. &nbsp;Morons.</p>

		<p>@Justice</p>
<p>Microsoft is NOT an illegal monopoly. &nbsp;In the end, all but a few of the original anti-trust stipulations actually held.</p>
<p>Getting away from that, how would you like it if IBM OS/2, Red Hat, Suse, Microsoft Windows, and Macintosh all had equal market share?</p>
<p>Say good bye to the days when you could write a program once and have it run seamlessly on 90% of the world&#8217;s machines. &nbsp;Say good bye to the fearless work of Raymond Chen on backwards compatiblity that allows your software to run on future versions of Windows without complaint (Linux and Mac are NOT known for back compat).</p>
<p>Count your blessings. &nbsp;MS isn&#8217;t perfect and even I have the occassional beef with them, but I&#8217;m also smart enough to recognize the incredible favor they are doing for us.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m suggesting that the Start menu is not necessary, and it&#8217;s evil because it creates a second hierarchy of programs and files.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really just there because of the Win31 Program Manager.</p>
<p>On the Mac, there is no equivalent of the Start menu, users are acquainted with the equivalent of the &quot;C:Program Files&quot; folder directly, instead, and the rest of the design goes from there.</p>

<p>The Mac does maintain MRU lists for applications and documents in the Apple menu. Also, the dock functions as a program launcher, and is initially populated with a collection of stuff that Apple wrote. I find myself using the dock, or a spotlight search, more often than opening up /Applications.</p>

		<p>Why was the icon also moved in the version distributed in EU? In comparation, Windows Mediaplayer wasn&#8217;t removed in the US edition when EU banned it from windows.</p>

<p>The Dock s really not comparable with the start menu, from a usability standpoint. Yes, it is an application launcher but as Ulric states about UI design, the UI should be designed and then implemented. Not engineered, implemented and then designed as a UI. You always know where to slide the cursor to start something from the dock, not so with the start menu.</p>
<p>Also, you don&#180;t need to open up /Applications all that often exactly because the UI is designed in such a way that your selected frequently used apps are right at your fingertips in the Dock, and Spotlight search also actually works surprisingly well.</p>
<p>The point I think Ulric was trying to make is that the Start menu is as complicated as going to /Applications to start an app, yet has little of the functionality. It&#180;s an additional abstraction layer of shortcuts which Apple has shown not to be neccessary, admittedly by bundling each app as an archive with it&#180;s folder structure hidden, but for the user it&#180;s simple.</p>
<p>Having XP, Ubuntu and MacOS X around the house (and working in sales and doing the odd repairs for Vista) I can state with full confidence that the user experience on the Mac is by far the most enjoyable, mostly due to the UI, I&#180;m torn whether to put Ubuntu or XP in second place, but have no qualms about placing Vista dead last, it&#180;s just too complicated, the simplified parts are terrible IF you have a problem and can&#180;t use wizards, and UI inconsistencies are a nightmare.</p>
<p>This really isn&#180;t meant as MS bashing, I think XP is in many respects pretty decent, and had hopes for Vista, and still hope it will be usable after SP1 or SP2.</p>
<p>And for that matter, MacOS X wasn&#180;t very good from the beginning, after 4 MAJOR upgrades it is truly excellent. If MS dares to make as big changes to Vista, it could also be terrific, but then they might need to sacrifice some backwards compatibility.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
