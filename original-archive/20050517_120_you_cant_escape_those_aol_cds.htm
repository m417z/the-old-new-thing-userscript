<p>One of my colleagues was unpacking one of those $30,000 quad-processor more-memory-than-you-know-what-to-do-with super-server computers. The kind that require their own electrical substation.</p>
<p> And it came with an AOL CD. </p>
<p> It's like buying a Lexus and finding a 35-cents-off coupon in the glove compartment. </p>
<p> Apparently, one of the questions AOL tech support asks when people call in complaining that they can't get their AOL CD to work is, "<a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/archrndwn/2004/nov/041113.waitwait.html">Do you have a computer?</a>" [Opening Panel Round, second question] because so many people who don't have computers stick the CD into their stereo or DVD player and can't get it to work. </p>

		<p>If this is the case, they should put an audio track on it saying to put it in a computer, not a stereo.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like it could be full or anything.</p>

		<p>I remember a Former Life when I worked at a hollywood video and for a few months we had to put AOL cd&#8217;s in everyone&#8217;s bag. The CDs they gave us were 3&quot; CDs in about 49 square inches of packaging that said &quot;WE DID IT! WE PUT THE WHOLE INTERNET ON A CD THAT FITS IN THE MIDDLE RING OF YOUR CD DRIVE!!&quot;<br />
<br />The contents of the CD? A 400KB .exe that downloaded about 8 megs of installer over your 28.8 modem.</p>

		<p>AOLs floppy/CD mass distribution campaign is downright shameful.  It disgusts me to think how much landfill space they are taking up.  I&#8217;m assuming most people do with them the same that I do, immediately throw them away.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found they&#8217;ve saved me a small bit of money, as they make great targets when we go shooting down at the county dump&#8230; with the exception that a bullseye and a miss are indistinguishable.</p>

		<p>So I guess no one has heard of AOL&#8217;s alternate name. The Great American Coaster Company.  I have a nice collection on my coffee table.</p>

		<p>I was round at a friend&#8217;s house a few years back, and he&#8217;d just bought a magazine that came with a CD-ROM, with a warning not to play it on your stereo because it would destroy the speakers.<br />
<br />So my friend stuck the CD-ROM in his stereo anyway, just to see what would happen.<br />
<br />A voice appeared saying &quot;Now we told you not to play this, but since you did anyway, I might as well tell you what&#8217;s on the disc!&quot;</p>

		<p>To my mind, this is the equivalent of installing Windows Advanced Server and finding an Outlook Express icon on it. Why is installing an email/news client on a server the default option???</p>

		<p>An old game for the Sega Saturn had an audio track that went something like &quot;this game is intended only for the Sega Saturn console, please remove it from your CD player immediately.. or kiss your tweeters goodbye!&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
