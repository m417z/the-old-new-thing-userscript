<p>Wait, what's a floppy disk drive?</p>
<p> For those youngsters out there, floppy disks are where we stored data before the invention of the USB earring. A single floppy disk could hold up to <i>two seconds</i> of CD-quality audio. This may not sound like a lot, but it was in fact pretty darned awesome, because CDs hadn't been invented yet either. </p>
<p> Anyway, if you had a dodgy floppy disk (say, because you decided to fold it in half), you often heard a clattering sound from the floppy disk drive as it tried to salvage what data it could from the disk. What is that sound? </p>
<p> That sound is recalibration. </p>
<p> The floppy disk driver software kept getting errors back from the drive saying "I can't find any good data." The driver figures, "Hm, maybe the problem is that the drive head is not positioned where I think it is." You see, floppy drives do not report the actual head position; you have to infer it by taking the number of "move towards the center" commands you have issued and subtracting the number of "move towards the edge" commands. The actual location of the drive head could differ from your calculations due to an error in the driver, or it could just be that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning"> small physical errors have accumulated over time</a>, resulting in a significant difference between the theoretical and actual positions. (In the same way that if you tell somebody to step forward ten steps, then backward ten steps, they probably won't end up exactly where they started.) </p>
<p> To get the logical and physical positions back in sync, the driver does what it can to get the drive head to a known location. It tells the hardware, "Move the drive head one step toward the edge of the disk. Okay, take another step. One more time. Actually, 80 more times." Eventually, the drive head reaches the physical maximum position, and each time the driver tells the hardware to move the head one more step outward, it just bumps against the physical boundary of the drive hardware and makes a click sound. If you issue at least as many "one more step outward" commands as there are steps from the innermost point of the disk to the edge, then the theory is that at the end of the operation, the head is in fact at track zero. At that point, you can set your internal "where is the drive head?" variable to zero and restart the original operation, this time with greater confidence that the drive head is where you think it is. </p>
<p> The amount of clattering depends on where the drive head was when the operation began. If the drive head were around track 40, then the first 40 requests to move one step closer to the center would do exactly that, and then next 43 requests would make a clicking noise. On the other hand, if the drive head were closer to track zero already, then nearly all of the requests result in the drive head bumping against the physical boundary of the drive hardware, and you get a longer, noisier clicking or grinding sound. </p>
<p> You can hear the recalibration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gnMgmlKi_o"> at the start of this performance</a>. </p>

		<p>Has anybody else noticed the total lack of quality in modern 3.5&quot; floppy disks? I needed a disk to do a BIOS update on a system last year and of course I didn&#39;t own any. I went to Office Max, all they had was a big box of 40. And out of those 40 disks, exactly 5 of them actually worked.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s beem a long time since I messed up with floppies, but I think your explanation does not applies precisely to PC drives. If I remember well, PC floppy drives had a sensor for the track 0 position, so it would not need to bang at the end. The sound you hear on a PC is just the head moving up and down. On the other hand, Woz did not use the sensor in his Disk II interface for the Apple II (to reduce the hardware in the interface, latter Apple lowered the cost of the drives by demanding drives without the sensor).</p>

<li>I doubt many have noticed, given that most PCs nowadays don&#39;t have a 3.5&quot; floppy drive. Most can boot from USB disk-on-key, and also update BIOSs from within Windows.</li>
<li>
<p>Towards the end of their use, indeed I noticed quality was degrading. I always considered them an unreliable medium, and when backing up unto them, always made 2 copies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I generally like old tech&#8230; but not floppies. I&#39;ve always considered them lousy, unreliable tech.</p>

		<p>@Jonathan: actually the data on 5.25&quot; floppies of our old Commodore 64 survived fine for about 15 years, while almost everything stored on cassettes was corrupted here and there. But I think this was a lucky exception, floppies were way more unreliable than almost any media that we use today.</p>
<p>Related: I still have around an ancient 3.5&quot; drive from a PC of the early nineties. It was the best floppy drive I ever had, incredibly quiet and managed to read floppies that were unreadable for almost any other drive. I used it as a replacement for the crappy &quot;stock&quot; floppy drives on my PCs, until in recent years I got a motherboard with no floppy connector.</p>

		<p>I remember in the early 90s I had a 3.5&quot; floppy drive that failed to read anything correctly (except occasionally by random chance). Disks were also noticeably loose in the drive, so obviously something was wrong. I removed the drive from the system and took it back to the store that I purchased it and proceeded to demonstrate the ill-fitting floppy&#8230; and it fit perfectly. They hooked it up, tested it, and it worked great</p>
<p>I took it back home, reinstalled it in my PC, and the problem returned. The disks didn&#39;t fit right and didn&#39;t read right. So, what was the cause of this mystery? It turned out the drive worked fine as long as it didn&#39;t have any screws in it. An alignment issue or something meant that if I screwed it into the PC case, it was bent out of shape causing the problem. I replaced it and all was fine, but that was a weird issue.</p>

		<p>A teenager recently asked me why drive lettering always seems to start at C: and never any other letter. Explaining that A: and B: were reserved for the first two floppy drives in the system didn&#39;t seem to help much, unfortunately.</p>

		<p>@kinokijuf: &nbsp;Technically, there are drivers at that point in setup to drive the monitor and read the CD drive and the hard disk (and the floppy drive, if any), and some other things, but not enough to read a flash drive. &nbsp;In Windows 7, on the other hand, I think that you can read things from a USB flash drive at that point in setup. &nbsp;Of course, Windows 7 setup has SATA drivers running at that point in setup anyway, so the need for F6 drivers is less.</p>
<p>But you&#39;re right, XP setup is not going to be improved at this point. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>@Daniel &#8211; Are you sure the sensor was for track 0 and not sector 0? I remember Apple II didn&#39;t use the hole in the disk to detect the position of the first sector, so you had to read the whole track until you find the signature for the beginning.</p>

		<p>Ah, nostalgia! The joy of having 30+ disks for Office 4.2 Professional, all lined up in order, and then having the installer ask for them in a random order! What fun.</p>
<p>LS120s were slightly better &#8211; you could almost fit 1/5th of a CD on one 3.5&quot; disk. The noise was pretty much the same, though.</p>

		<p>Technically, USB legacy emulation in BIOS could allow XP and Win2003 use an USB floppy drive or an USB stick, but those weren&#39;t presented by the BIOS as exactly the floppy drives. This is why one had to have a real legacy floppy on a real controller. Luckily, Win2003 is out of fashion already.</p>

		<p>This noise is often the stepper motor itself, not just the banging against the stop.</p>
<p>Each movement of the stepper motor can produce a small sound, and if the movement is done at the correct rate, acoustic principles amplify then into a raspy sound.</p>
<p>If you start on one edge of the floppy and slew back and forth to near the other edge, you can produce a similar sound. &nbsp;Position the directory at the start of the floppy, then rapidly writing small files near the other edge, to cause constant slewing back to the directory as each new file is opened/closed. &nbsp;This is alleviated by caching the directory, which brings it own set of problems.</p>

		<p>What I never understood is why opening an Explorer window at Computer always causes the floppy to make the grinding noise.</p>
<p>As for capacity, sure, only two seconds of uncompressed CD quality, but also 10 copies of a typical novel.</p>

		<p>When I read the title, I half expected the entire blog post to be &quot;That&#39;s how floppy drives sound. I know it&#39;s weird if you didn&#39;t grow up with them.&quot;</p>
<p>The C= 1541 was famous for its head-banging noise (which gets me a bit nostalgic, *tear*) and the fact that the collision was so hard, the drive could eventually get out of alignment. &nbsp;Once that happened, you had the problem of being able to read newly-formatted disks, but not older disks, because the head was no longer exactly over the tracks. &nbsp;And if you fixed the alignment, you had the opposite problem: you couldn&#39;t read those newer disks anymore.</p>

		<p>Floppy drives aren&#39;t much more reliable than the disks in them&#8230; mine probably all need their heads cleaning.</p>
<p>I only saw one LS120 drive and I wasn&#39;t using it with a LS120 disk but it seemed to be much better at reading floppy disks than a &quot;real&quot; drive.</p>
<p>And bootable USB sticks aren&#39;t much use when third-party product X only installs on floppy drives.</p>

		<p>Not only is there a Track 0 sensor, but Amstrad PCWs use it to tell if they&#39;ve got 3.5&quot; or 3.0&quot; drives. They seek to track 0, turn off the drive motor, and see if the Track 0 signal goes away or not. On (IIRC) the 3.0&quot; drives, the signal stops when the motor is off, while on the 3.5&quot; drives it doesn&#39;t.</p>

		<p>&quot;Technically, USB legacy emulation in BIOS could allow XP and Win2003 use an USB floppy drive or an USB stick, but those weren&#39;t presented by the BIOS as exactly the floppy drives&quot;</p>
<p>Actually, the problem is that while XP/2003 Setup can detect and load drivers for USB floppy drives for after the kernel starts, the list of device IDs of USB floppy drives built into setup was incomplete, which means in most cases it wasn&#39;t being loaded:</p>

		<p>@Alex Grigoriev: BIOS interface to floppy, HDD and &quot;legacy USB&quot; are almost exactly the same. The only difference is that HDD are numbered from 128 to 255 while FDD are numbered from 0 to 127.</p>
<p>Actually, if I had a time machine, I would make Windows XP installation look for drivers on any HDD the BIOS recognizes, and maybe, CD-ROMS, since Windows is able to load default drivers from the setup CD-ROM.</p>
<p>Anyway, with a slightly improved SYSLINUX MEMDISK, it&#39;s possible to fake a FDD to Windows XP text mode setup.</p>

		<p>Didn&#39;t read all of the comments, so if anybody did write this already, ignore it or try to bang my head onto the table ;)</p>
<p>Actually, there&#39;s no error that can &quot;accumulate&quot;. The floppy drives I know have a stepper motor with a step of one track, so there&#39;s nothing to accumulate except whole tracks (in which case, ONE recalibration should be enough to know exactly the current track number). Most likely it&#39;s just the effect that the r/w head might find a little bit different position when recalibrating due to mechanical tolerances.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
