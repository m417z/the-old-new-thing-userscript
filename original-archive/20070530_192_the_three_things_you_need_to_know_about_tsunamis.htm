		<p>One datum of noise is the argument over whether the correct plural is tsunami (as in Japanese) or tsunamis (as in conventional English).:)</p>

		<p>nonsense. tsunami IS plural. The singular for tsunami is tsunamus. However, it is never used since there is no SINGLE wave. They always come in one or more &#8216;files&#8217;, with each wave within a single file stretching a small distance, typically 50 &#8211; 100ft. Basic physics stuff, kids!</p>

<p>What about solitons?</p>

<p>Incidentally, I heard in Thai tsunami a bunch of people were saved because someone worked out from the sea rapidly receding that a tsunami was about to hit.</p>

<p>Er&#8230;tsunami is Japanese, not Latin. Tsunami in Japanese is both singular and plural. How we use it in English is another matter. I&#8217;ve seen both usages (pl. tsunami and pl. tsunamis), and I would be reluctant to denounce either.</p>

		<p>The tsunami was an adumbration of the wrath of God, a harbinger of things to come: that Great Day of Judgment. Amos 3:6 &quot;Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?&quot;</p>

		<p>Are the geeks visiting here so humorless as to take my tongue-in-cheek comment seriously?</p>
<p>Actually I dropped the second part where I was going to say:</p>
<p>&#8216;Japanese named tsunami so because they wished that these waves hit &#8211; quote &#8211; those d*#$ed chinese (from the land of sun &lt;u&gt;TZU&lt;/u&gt;) and Vietnamese (from &lt;u&gt;&#8217;NAM&lt;/u&gt;) instead&#8217;</p>

		<p>Well, this geek is too used to seeing overapplication of Latin. In retrospect your joke was actually pretty funny. :)</p>
<p>Hint: use smileys on the Internet to convey that your tongue is in your cheek. I can&#8217;t really see it from here. :)</p>

<p>Yes. If you want humour to be supported, you need to rebuild with CFG_SUP_HUMOUR and CFG_NO_STRIP_HUMOR_SUPPORT defined. That should be OBVIOUS, even to YOU.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
