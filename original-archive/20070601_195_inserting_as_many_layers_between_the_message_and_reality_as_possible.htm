		<p>if all realities are created from perceptions, &nbsp;and many from social contructions, &nbsp;is reality a reality in the first place that a scenario can even be based on. &nbsp;Surely all realities are scenarios. I think I will go and fall over now.</p>

		<p>The movie Hildalgo claimed to be based on a true story.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not; it&#8217;s based on a story that the author claims is true but not one single fact in the story has ever been confirmed by anybody ever. It&#8217;s generally believed he made it all up.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m a stickler, but I don&#8217;t think that counts as &quot;based on a true story.&quot;</p>

		<p>This is like a homeopathic solution that is so dilute none of the active molecule remains. When the message is infinitely removed from reality, what remains is more potent than the thing itself: it is the very essence of reality.</p>
<p>The same principle has direct application to programming, by use of infinite loops to find the essential solution to an otherwise difficult problem.</p>

		<p>James: The movie Fargo says it&#8217;s &quot;based on a true story&quot; at the beginning. Of course, it&#8217;s not, but the writers figured that if the whole movie was a lie, one more is no big deal&#8230;</p>

		<p>I read it as lawyers too.</p>
<p>I think it was a trick of the mind, because the title is about deliberately confusing people and being far-distant from reality, so your mind reads &#8216;layers&#8217; as &#8216;lawyers&#8217;, because that IMO would be a more common word to use in this sentence.</p>

		<p>If I made a movie, the sub-title would claim it to be &#8216;based on true story&#8217; with a disclaimer in the next screen to the effect that &#8216;any similarities between the characters of the movie and real persons &#8211; living or dead &#8211; is purely coincidental&#8217;.</p>

		<p>Hmmm. The link that occurred to me was to Neal Stephenson&#8217;s &quot;In the beginning was the command line&#8230;&quot;[0], in the chapter on &quot;The Interface Culture&quot; &#8211;</p>
<p>&quot;I was in Disney World recently, specifically the part of it called the Magic Kingdom, walking up Main Street USA. This is a perfect gingerbready Victorian small town that culminates in a Disney castle. It was very crowded; we shuffled rather than walked. Directly in front of me was a man with a camcorder. It was one of the new breed of camcorders where instead of peering through a viewfinder you gaze at a flat-panel color screen about the size of a playing card, which televises live coverage of whatever the camcorder is seeing. He was holding the appliance close to his face, so that it obstructed his view. Rather than go see a real small town for free, he had paid money to see a pretend one, and rather than see it with the naked eye he was watching it on television.</p>
<p>And rather than stay home and read a book, I was watching him.&quot;</p>
<p>And he goes on to talk about mediated experiences in general.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
