		<p>I wonder why it is that my girlfriend&#8217;s mom has a &nbsp;house that&#8217;s about 3000 sq. feet with huge ceilings that&#8217;s been at 68 degrees all week while most of them have been away on vacation. &nbsp;It&#8217;s inhabited by three cats, my girlfriend (about 8 hours for sleep) and her little sister (slept there, I think, two nights over the last week, mostly at her dad&#8217;s otherwise).</p>
<p>The money she spends to cool that place could pay my rent.</p>

		<p>But wait! Big houses are more efficient to cool. Heat loss is a result of surface area which scales to the square, whereas living space is a function of volume, which scales to the cube.</p>
<p>So if people lived <em>together</em> in a big house, energy would be saved.</p>

		<p>I, on the other hand, turned off my AC when I went on vacation. &nbsp;While we were gone we had a HHH streak (thats hot, hazy, humid). &nbsp;When I got back the neighbours told me that my smoke alarms had been going off for 2 days straight. &nbsp;The firefighters and police had been by to check on the house. &nbsp;Their working theory was that the humidity in the house got too high and I should have left the AC on to keep it down. &nbsp;Though to their credit they did say to set it higher than normal 27-28 C (81-84 F).</p>

<p>But that is more or less what the normal should be. Maybe a degree or two less if there is really high humidity.</p>
<p>There is nothing stupider than seeing people in Florida wearing jackets and ties because the air-conditioning inside the building is set so high.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
