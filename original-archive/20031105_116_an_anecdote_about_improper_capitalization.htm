<p>         I've already discussed <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc/PermaLink.aspx/3cfdaedf-2060-4697-b7bf-19205d8448aa">some         of the strange consequences of case-sensitive comparisons</a>.      </p>
<p>         <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/10/14.html">Joe Beda mentioned         the Internet Explorer capitalization bug that transformed somebody's name into a dead         body</a>. Allow me to elaborate. You might learn something.      </p>
<p>         This bug occurred because Internet Explorer tried to capitalize the characters in         the name "Yamada" but was not mindful of the character-combining rules of the double-byte         932 character set used for Japanese. In this character set, a single glyph can be         represented either by one or two bytes. The Roman character "A" is represented by         the single byte 0x41. On the other hand, the characters "&#12398;" is represented         by the two bytes 0x82 0xCC. (You will need to have Japanese fonts installed to see         the "no" character properly.)      </p>
<p>         When you parse a Japanese string in this character set, you need to maintain state.         If you see a byte that is marked as a "DBCS lead byte", then it and the byte following         must be treated as a single unit. There is no relationship between the character represented         by 0xE8 0x41 (&#37666;) and 0xE8 0x61 (&#37942;) even though the second bytes happen         to be related when taken on their own (0x41 = "A" and 0x61 = "a").      </p>
<p>         Internet Explorer forgot this rule and merely inspected and capitalized each byte         independently. So when it came time to capitalize the characters making up the name         "Yamada", the second bytes in the pairs were erroneously treated as if they were Roman         characters and "capitalized" accordingly. The result was that the name "Yamada" turned         into the characters meaning "corpse" and "field". You can imagine how Mr. Yamada felt         about this.      </p>
<p>         Converting the string to Unicode would have helped a little, since the Unicode capitalization         rules would certainly not have connected two unrelated characters in that way. But         there are still risks in character-by-character capitalization: In some languages,         capitalization is itself context-sensitive. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/getwr/steps/wrg_sort.mspx">MSDN         gives as an example</a> that in Hungarian, "SC" and "Sc" are not the same thing when         compared case-insensitively.      </p>

		<p>&quot;in Hungarian, &quot;SC&quot; and &quot;Sc&quot; are not the same thing when compared case-insensitively.&quot;</p>
<p>You probably mean &quot;SZ&quot;/&quot;Sz&quot;, oder &quot;CS&quot;/&quot;Cs&quot;, or any other Hungarian digraph, but &quot;Sc&quot; is not one of them :-)</p>

		<p>Wow Raymond,<br />
You are really digging in the archives.  As for where IE does capitalization, I believe it was something to do with storing cookies or the cache, if I remember correctly.</p>

		<p>Joe is correct. The case conversion was done as part of autogenerating the filename for cookie storage. So if your name was Yamada and you went to your %userprofile%Cookies directory and did a &quot;dir&quot; you saw &quot;dead <a href="mailto:body@msn.com">body@msn.com</a>&quot;, &quot;dead <a href="mailto:body@yahoo.com">body@yahoo.com</a>&quot;, &quot;@dead <a href="mailto:body@msnbc.com">body@msnbc.com</a>&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>What makes the problem worse is that the error is in filenames. So fixing the bug means that everybody whose name contains CJK characters (and that&#8217;s an awful lot of people) will lose their cookies on upgrade. So fixing the bug introduces data loss. (And you can&#8217;t auto-upgrade the cookies since you don&#8217;t know which letters to &quot;uncapitalize&quot; and which to leave alone.)</p>

		<p>What can really give you a headache is that DBCS languages have double-byte versions of the Roman letters, and files with those versions in different case can coexist.<br />
Using the notation &lt;X&gt; to mean &quot;double-byte X&quot; it&#8217;s perfectly legal to have &lt;a&gt;.txt and &lt;A&gt;.txt together in the same directory.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all at some point upper- or lower-cased filenames for comparison, since the file system is case-insensitive and all. However, if you blindly lowercase everything, you might end up operating on &lt;a&gt;.txt when you meant to operate on &lt;A&gt;.txt.  D&#8217;oh. So you have to be sure you only change the case of single-byte letters.</p>

		<p>I am getting a weird error when reading the RSS feed for this page. The rendered page contains a unicode sequence (&amp;#12398;) for the japanses characters. The RSS feed does not. Nor are they valid UTF-8 characters! (0xE3 0x81 0xAE). I haven&#8217;t figured out how to make my XML parser eat these so your blog has disappeared from my sites for a while. Any way to fix this? Is it a bug in BlogX?</p>

		<p>You&#8217;re right, it looks like a bug in blogx. The actual blog entry uses &amp;#12345; entities, but it looks like somebody was a bit too &quot;helpful&quot; when it game to spitting out the RSS. Sorry.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
