		<p>What&#8217;s funny is the cognitive dissonance expressed by parents in the articles. There&#8217;s the ostrich head-in-the-sand response flatly denying the obvious quid pro quo, or the &quot;f everyone else, so long as my kid gets ahead&quot; response.. Wow. Just Wow.</p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t see any evidence of this at Caltech. &nbsp;The students all seemed legit. &nbsp;Everyone I knew there was a first generation Caltech student.</p>
<p>Signs of wealth were extremely rare. &nbsp;No links to celebrity of the usual sort, though I am aware of a very few students over the years whose parents are famous mathematicians or scientists. &nbsp;They seemed to have academic merit of their own.</p>
<p>Of course, physics boot camp has little or no social prestige. &nbsp;There might not be many wealthy people who dream of sending the kids there. &nbsp;Little Chadwick and Tiffany probably aren&#8217;t red hot on the idea either.</p>
<p>Quantum Hoops provides some clues about the situation. &nbsp;The poor basketball coach has been trying for years to find a basketball player he can get past the admissions committee. &nbsp;Any basketball player. &nbsp;Maybe someday.</p>

<p>My first thought on reading this is: In other words, &quot;You&#8217;re wrong, Y can do X.&quot;</p>

		<p>I was a contract developer on the admissions project at as ivy league university. &nbsp;In the admission database there&#8217;s a boolean called VIP, but no descriptor so they can &quot;cover their ass&quot; and not claim special treatment.</p>
<p>In a nutshell I&#8217;d say the sort order for top candidates are: VIP, race (according to affirmative action requirements) and then grades.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to admit to this stuff, but I&#8217;m guessing what toggles VIP is:</p>
<ol>
<li>parents donate lots of money</li>
<li>
<p>related to a college employee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sports scholarship</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I suspect most colleges work this way, but they will deny it to the bitter end.</p>

<p>This is the standard response for talking about your kids. As long as he&#8217;s not a complete screwup, you sort of expect that.</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>Now that&#8217;s irony &#8211; AA institutionalizes racism.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
