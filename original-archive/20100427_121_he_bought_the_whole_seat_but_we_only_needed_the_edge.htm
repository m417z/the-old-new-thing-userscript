<p> After the Windows&nbsp;95 project was released to manufacturing, but before the launch event itself, the team finally had a chance to relax and unwind after many years of hard work. The project manager decided to have a morale event to get everyone together to do something fun. A typical morale event might be going to see a baseball game, renting out a movie theater to watch the latest action flick, or something as simple as a picnic or a softball game. </p>
<p> But this time, the project manager decided to do something different, something wild, something crazy, something everybody would talk about for days: He bought everyone tickets to the monster truck rally. (And he bought the whole seat, even though we'd only need the edge.) </p>

		<p>At least it&#8217;s different. From my experience, 4 out of 5 of our morale events were &quot;rent out a bar and play pool and ping pong&quot; events.</p>
<p>My experience has been that the really fun morale events are the ones that involve the team splitting up into teams and attacking each other. A fairly tame whitewater rafting expedition was livened up greatly by smuggling water cannons aboard and launching raids on the opposing boats (to steal the water cannons of course). And paintball always works well; nothing like coming home covered in welts to boost the endorphin levels.</p>

		<p>We went canoeing with the company last summer. One of the groups had brought some squirt guns to annoy the others. We ended up getting our revenge by splashing them using our paddles, and one boat was even capsized when a guy jumped off his boat and swam over. That was one of the best company trips I have had.</p>

		<p>One time we went as a whole company to play golf. And it was mandatory &#8211; not kidding. I asked one of executive guys: didn&#8217;t we say that we&#8217;ll ship on Monday? His response was: well, there are few more Mondays coming up &#8211; we&#8217;ll manage somehow.</p>

		<p>One of the more unusual ship parties I&#8217;ve been to was a curling event at the Granite Curling Club in Seattle. &nbsp;Getting those stones to go where you want them to go (and, more importantly, stop where you want them to stop) is surprisingly difficult. &nbsp;It was a lot of fun to try something that&#8217;s just a little bit out of the ordinary.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t trust product celebrations since the very first one I went to, which was a baseball game. &nbsp;Oh, the game was fine. &nbsp;It was the next day when half the team was laid off that was the problem.</p>

		<p>If you haven&#8217;t played Whirlyball, and it is available in your area, take your team and try it.</p>
<p>Imagine lacrosse, played in bumper cars. &nbsp;It is insanely fun. &nbsp;And competitive without being unfair to the uncoordinated or slow, since how graceful can you be trying to catch a whiffle ball from a bumper car?</p>
<p>We played at our engineering meeting and no one could get enough.</p>

		<p>&quot;stress out thinking of ways to get out of doing it! I see you people more than enough during the week thanks!&quot;</p>
<p>Yep, I have a real problem with &quot;team building events&quot; held in what would otherwise be an employee&#8217;s personal time where attendance is made pseudo-compulsory, since non-attendance indicates lack of commitment to the team.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked for such companies and frankly, they have the least esprit de corps and the biggest morale problems. &nbsp;By contrast I currently work for a company which doesn&#8217;t have organised &quot;team building&quot; events, but where there is a strong team spirit and people willingly and enthusiastically socialise with the team in their own time.</p>
<p>In my experience, organised &quot;team building&quot; is an attempt/need to compensate for a lack of &quot;team spirit&quot; caused by working practices and environment. &nbsp;Running around in the woods a couple of times a year can&#8217;t compensate for that.</p>
<p>Having said that, a company paid trip to a fun event as a &quot;reward for a job well done&quot;, as I think is described in the original post, is of course slightly different and usually very welcome.</p>

		<p>Agreed that such &quot;team building events&quot; will have negative event if it would be held at employee&#8217;s personal time.</p>
<p>For most software companies the working schedule is flexible. Why wouldn&#8217;t they allow one workday devoted to such activity (afterall it&#8217;s considered beneficial for the company&#8217;s performance) and delay works by one day? I&#8217;d think such delay after product shipment to be quite affordable.</p>

		<p>Yeah. Nothing sucks worse than mandatory team building&#8230; off company time. Add to that expenses not paid, and you&#8217;ve united the team against the manager.</p>
<p>Thankfully, managers have seen the light, and it&#8217;s often something like a nice lunch out with everyone on the team.</p>
<p>Another time I simply skipped out and went for a walk &#8211; and came back to a nearly empty office and did my work.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m glad that where I work we don&#8217;t really have those mandatory teambuilding events, and it&#8217;s not really neccessary.</p>
<p>We did have a cool &#8216;job well done&#8217; thing one saturday morning though, namely a trip to a gunnery range to do some shooting. For those of us not living in the US this is not something you get to do very often, and it was well worth my free time :) (And the boss paid for it too)</p>

		<p>Could please anyone explain me what &quot;He bought the whole seat, but we only needed the edge&quot; means? I&#8217;m German and I don&#8217;t really understand it. I know what a seat is and I know what an edge is. But I don&#8217;t understand the meaning in this context.</p>

		<p>Michael, this relates to an English idiom &quot;(to be) on the edge of {their} seat&quot; meaning to be very excited. Imagine if you are sat in an audience for an event and something exciting happens, you may unconsciously move slightly forward as if this small change will make it easier to see what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>Advertising, particularly for events like a monster truck rally may play on this metaphor by suggesting that you will be in this state (of excitement) for the entire event. So although you must buy a ticket for &quot;a whole seat&quot; to see the event, you will only &nbsp;sit on (and thus need) the edge of it.</p>
<p>So, this article title is a reference to the advertising for monster truck rallys.</p>
<p>I think you get The Simpsons in Germany, you can see an example of this style of advertising in an episode where the Simpsons go to a monster truck show.</p>

		<p>@Nick: Thanks for your explanation. It&#8217;s like you bought a ticket for a place with a seat but you don&#8217;t need the seat because the show is that good that you stand all the time anyway.</p>
<p>And yes, we get The Simpsons in Germany, but I don&#8217;t watch it regularly and they are synchronized so this proverb might get lost. But I can&#8217;t think of a proverb in German that expresses the same meaning.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  And paintball always works well;
</p></blockquote>
<p>It does! We did this with our team well over a year ago. Even though a lot of team members have left and been replaced, those that were there back then still talk about it to this day.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
