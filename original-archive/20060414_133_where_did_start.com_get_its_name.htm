<p>I remember some time ago getting a piece of email that basically said, "Hey, is anybody using <a href="http://start.com"> start.com</a>?"</p>
<p> I have since learned that that domain was registered by the marketing department, presumably to "synergize" with the "Start Me Up" campaign or something like that, but nothing ever happened with it. Nevertheless the registration kept getting renewed year after year. (Perhaps we should also put marketing in charge of renewing <a href="http://passport.com">passport.com</a> since they seem to do a better job of <a href="http://www.doublewide.net/"> keeping on top of expiring registrations</a> than whoever is in charge of Passport.) </p>
<p> It was probably at about the time I got that email that <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/startcom/"> the start team</a> (except that wasn't their name yet) was looking for a domain name they could use to host their little experiment, and they stumbled across start.com and wondered whether anybody was using it. Nobody was, so they took it and did something interesting. </p>
<p> The rest is history. </p>
<p> (Oh wait, <strong>this</strong> was history, too.) </p>

		<p>wow, i can&#8217;t imagine someone who owned start.com would let it expire. the domain name alone probably brings in thousands of visitors (read: advertisement!!)</p>

		<p>Nobody let start.com expire. Assuming they registered it back in 1995, most domains were available. The registration wasn&#8217;t for a limited period of time because you didn&#8217;t have to pay for them back then. Once registrations required payment, MS just kept renewing it, only to actually start using it 10 years later.</p>

		<p>Coward: It doesn&#8217;t look like they&#8217;re bypassing DNS there. &nbsp;It looks, instead, like they&#8217;re bypassing the hosts file and *always* using DNS.</p>
<p>Which is just as broken in certain cases, and reduces my trust in the entire DNS client API in Windows by at least an order of magnitude. &nbsp;But they still don&#8217;t &quot;bypass&quot; DNS. &nbsp;;-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
