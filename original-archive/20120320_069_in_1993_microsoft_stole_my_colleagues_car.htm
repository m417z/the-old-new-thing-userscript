<p>I remember walking between buildings at Microsoft back in the 1990's and seeing a moss-covered, rusted-out jalopy in one of the parking spaces. It clearly hadn't moved in ages. The person I was with said, "Oh, yeah, Microsoft owns that car. They stole it from Bob." (Bob is my generic name for a Microsoft employee.)</p>
<p> The <a href="http://www.climate.washington.edu/stormking/January1993.html"> Inaugural Day Storm of 1993</a> left felled trees and other wind damage in its wake on the Microsoft Redmond campus. One of my colleagues was out of town when the storm hit, and he returned to stories of fallen trees, wind damage, and howling winds. </p>
<p> Bob also returned to find that his car had been stolen out of the parking lot outside his building. (It was at the time a common practice to use Microsoft's parking lots as personal vehicle storage.) </p>
<p> Bob filed a stolen-car report with his insurance company and received his payment. As far as Bob was concerned, that was the end of that. </p>
<p> But that's not the whole story. </p>
<p> Right after the storm, the Facilities department set about cleaning up all the trees and branches and leaves that were strewn across the parking lots. They waited until after work hours so the parking lot would be empty, but that didn't work in one particular lot, because Bob's car was still there. To permit the cleanup to proceed, they towed the car to the far corner of the parking lot to get it out of the way. </p>
<p> Thus, when Bob returned from his trip, he found that his car was gone. It was actually not that far away, but this particular parking lot was nestled in a densely-wooded area, with the lot divided into sub-lots, each separated by a small stand of trees, so if you didn't know where to look, you could easily have missed the car. </p>
<p> This left the car sitting abandoned in a Microsoft parking lot. Technically, the car was owned by Bob's insurance company, and technically Microsoft stole it. </p>
<p> <b>Pre-emptive snarky comment</b>: "Wouldn't be the first time Microsoft stole something." </p>

		<p>Note that the comment allegedly posted by xpclient appears to have been posted anonymously. &nbsp;Compare, for example, the comment posted here <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2012/01/19/windows-virtual-pc-hotfix-for-amd-bulldozer-processors.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/windows-virtual-pc-hotfix-for-amd-bulldozer-processors.aspx</a> where &quot;xpclient&quot; is a link to that user&#39;s profile.</p>
<p>I suppose it&#39;s possible that xpclient really posted both comments but was not signed in, but it&#39;s also possible that someone who was not xpclient was putting words in xpclient&#39;s mouth.</p>

		<p>If a car goes unregistered in the state of Washington, the property owner can have it declared abandoned property and junked. This nearly happened to my own car after a little more than a year. I&#39;m surprised Bob&#39;s car sat long enough to gather moss.</p>

		<p>@Maurits See eg <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/03/13/10281708.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/10281708.aspx</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/03/06/10278049.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/10278049.aspx</a> for some examples where xpclient also didn&#39;t log in (he did log in in the third article I found though). Seems he just doesn&#39;t log in reliably. Or there really are several xpclients at work.</p>
<p>Also: I found out my psychic &quot;finding xpclient posts&quot; skills are enormous &#8211; well or he&#39;s just really repetitive (but me having psychic powers sounds better :( )</p>

		<p>I worked at Microsoft as recently as last fall (gave up my blue badge in October, sorry guys). &nbsp;Anyway, I can report that although I was not an old-timer like Raymond and his cohort, I did use a Microsoft garage as personal vehicle storage for 6 months in 2010 (with expired plates no less), and had a co-worker who did the same for much longer.</p>

		<p>In the 1993 storm, a tree fell across a Camero in front of building 2 from front to back. &nbsp;During the cleanup, they cut off the front and back of the tree, but left something like 15&#39; still on the car. &nbsp;Rumor has it they did this so the insurance company would see what caused the damage. &nbsp;It took another three weeks to get the car towed and I assume repaired.</p>

		<p>In the 1993 storm, the Windows NT group had an all-hands meeting scheduled in a building across campus at 10am. &nbsp;The storm hit and the meeting was cancelled. &nbsp;Security came around and told us to get out of window offices. (They didn&#39;t want to tell us that a tree an fallen thru a window office in the building. &nbsp;I wonder why) &nbsp;But no one cancelled the Pizza order, so around 10:30am a pizza truck pulled up in front of building 2 and the driver came inside to ask what to do with the Pizza. &nbsp;While this was happening, a tree fell across the truck! &nbsp;And what did people do? &nbsp;A bunch of devs rushed out to rescue the pizzas. &nbsp;That was an interesting choice. &nbsp;If memory serves me, there was no beer probably because it was a morning meeting. &nbsp;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
