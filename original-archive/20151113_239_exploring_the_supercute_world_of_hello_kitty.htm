There's still time to get to the
<a href="http://www.empmuseum.org/calendar/events/hello-kitty-supercute-opening-party.aspx">
Hello Kitty Supercute Opening Party</a>
at the
<a href="http://www.empmuseum.org/">
Experience Music Project</a>,
kicking off a four-month exhibition of
<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/record-breaking-exhibition-exploring-the-phenomenon-of-hello-kitty-coming-to-emp-on-november-14-2015-300136985.html">
Everything Hello Kitty</a>.
(Here are pictures from
<a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/12/23/hello-exploring-the-superweir.html">
the Los Angeles leg of the tour</a>.)</p>
<p>
Curiously, one of the events on the agenda for the opening night gala is
a "Q&amp;A with Hello Kitty" at 8:00pm,
which is going to be interesting,
seeing as Hello Kitty does not have a mouth.
</p>
<p>
One of the exhibit's sponsors is
<a href="http://www.uniqlo.com/us/">UNIQLO</a>,
who I should remind you,
has
<a href="http://www.uniqlo.jp/uniqlock/">
a very strange clock</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
EVA Air now has a thrice-weekly flight
<a href="http://evakitty.evaair.com/en/FlightRoutes.aspx">
between Taipei and Houston</a>,
so you can now fly
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/30/8440202.aspx">
Hello Kitty Air</a> from the United States.

		<p>My granddaughter &#8211; 6 1/2 years old &#8212; LOVES Hello Kitty.</p>
<p>2 years ago or so, my daughter and her husband got her a dog and they allowed my granddaughter to name the dog. &nbsp;The name she came up with? &nbsp;None other than &quot;Hello Kitty&quot;!</p>
<p>Last week, my daughter and her family went to South Carolina to visit the other grand parents so Mrs. 12BitSlab and I had dog sitting duty. &nbsp;From time to time, we had to take Hello Kitty outside to do her thing. &nbsp;When it was time to come back in the house, I would stand on the deck and yell, &quot;Hello Kitty!&quot; &nbsp;As you can imagine, my neighbors gave me some strange looks.</p>

		<p>As Hello Kitty is now supposed to be a British Girl dressed as a cat, the Q &amp; A session should be slightly more possible.</p>
<p>Although if her height is still supposed to be five apples tall and weigh three apples, then someone should ask how big the apples are.</p>

		<p>@Mike I&#39;d love to know where the money is coming from to pain the planes. Disney don&#39;t need the publicity &amp; you can&#39;t see the outside of the plane when you are in it. So is anyone going to fly that plane on purpose?</p>

<p>A British girl? &nbsp;I always thought Hello Kitty was a Dutch rabbit dressed as a cat.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
