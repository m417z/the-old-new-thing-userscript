<p>
A customer had a question about a pinvoke signature that
used a <code>UInt64</code> to hold a <code>FILETIME</code>
structure.
<span id="more-91771"></span>
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<pre>
[DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError = true)
static external bool GetProcessTimes(
    IntPtr hProcess,
    out UInt64 creationTime,
    out UInt64 exitTime,
    out UInt64 kernelTime,
    out UInt64 userTime);
</pre>
<p>
Is this legal?
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724284">
The documentation for <code>FILETIME</code></a> says
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
Do not cast a pointer to a <b>FILETIME</b> structure to
either a <b>ULARGE_INTEGER*</b>
or <b>__int64*</b> value because it can cause alignment
faults on 64-bit Windows.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Are we guilty of this cast in the above code?
After all
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/08/25/220195.aspx">
you can't treat a <code>FILETIME</code> as an <code>__int64</code></a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are two types of casts possible in this scenario.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Casting from <code>FILETIME*</code> to
    <code>__int64*</code>.</p>
<li>Casting from
    <code>__int64*</code> to
    <code>FILETIME*</code>.
</ul>
<p>
The <code>FILETIME</code> structure requires 4-byte alignment,
and the
<code>__int64</code> data type requires 8-byte alignment.
Therefore the first cast is unsafe,
because you are casting from a pointer with lax alignment requirements
to one with stricter requirements.
The second cast is safe because you are casting from a pointer
with strict alignment requirements to one with laxer requirements.
</p>
<table BORDER=0 BGCOLOR=pink
    STYLE="border: solid 1px black; width: 10em; height: 10em;">
<tr>
<td WIDTH=50% VALIGN=top>4-byte aligned</td>
<td WIDTH=50% VALIGN=top STYLE="border: solid 1px black; background-color: lightblue">8-byte aligned</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Everything in the blue box is also in the pink box,
but not vice versa.
</p>
<p>
Which cast is the one occurring in the above pinvoke signature?
</p>
<p>
In the above signature, the <code>UInt64</code>
is being allocated by the interop code,
and therefore it is naturally aligned for <code>UInt64</code>,
which means that it is 8-byte aligned.
The
<code>Get&shy;Process&shy;Times</code> function then treats those
eight bytes as a <code>FILETIME</code>.
So we are in the second case,
where we cast from
<code>__int64*</code> to
<code>FILETIME*</code>.
</p>
<p>
Mind you, you can avoid all this worrying by simply declaring your
pinvoke more accurately.
The correct solution is to declare the last four parameters as
<code>ComTypes.FILETIME</code>.
Now there are no sneaky games.
Everything is exactly what it says it is.

		<p>@Richard T Russell</p>
<p>To dovetail off of Raymond to write code based on such an assumption violates the 10th C Commandment (Reproduced from the Annotated edition below):</p>
<p>10. Thou shalt foreswear, renounce, and abjure the vile heresy which claimeth that &#8220;All the world&#39;s a VAX&#39;&#39;, and have no commerce with the benighted heathens who cling to this barbarous belief, that the days of thy program may be long even though the days of thy current machine be short.</p>
<p>This particular heresy bids fair to be replaced by &#8220;All the world&#39;s a Sun&#39;&#39; or &#8220;All the world&#39;s a 386&#39;&#39; (this latter being a particularly revolting invention of Satan), but the words apply to all such without limitation. Beware, in particular, of the subtle and terrible &#8220;All the world&#39;s a 32-bit machine&#39;&#39;, which is almost true today but shall cease to be so before thy resume grows too much longer.</p>

		<p>This is also an endianness issue. &nbsp;The only big-endian target using Windows-like headers that I know of is Xbox 360; on 360, I believe that FILETIME still had dwLowDateTime as the first member. &nbsp;This makes it improper to cast a FILETIME like this as well, even in the manner shown.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
