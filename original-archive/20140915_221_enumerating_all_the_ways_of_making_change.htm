<p>
Today's Little Program enumerates all the ways of making
change for a particular amount given a set of available denominations.
</p>
<p>
The algorithm is straightforward.
To make change for a specific amount from a set of available
denominations,
you can take one denomination and decide
how many of those you want to use.
Then use the remaining denominations to make change for the remainder.
</p>
<p>
For example, if the available coins have values [1, 5, 10, 25]
and you want to make change for 60 cents, you first decide how many
25-cent pieces you want to use.
If you use none, then you need to make change for 60 cents
using just [1, 5, 10].
If you use one, then you need to make change for 35 cents
using just [1, 5, 10].
And if you use two, then you need to make change for 10 cents
using just [1, 5, 10].
</p>
<p>
(We use the largest coin first to reduce the number of dead ends,
like asking "Please make change for 83 cents using only 10-cent coins.")
</p>
<pre>
function MakeChange(coins, total, f) {
 if (total == 0) { f([]); return; }
 if (coins.length == 0) return;

 var coin = coins[coins.length - 1];
 var remaining = coins.slice(0, -1);
 var used = [];
 for (var target = total; target &gt;= 0; target -= coin) {
  MakeChange(remaining, target, function(s) {
   f(used.concat(s));
  });
  used.push(coin);
 }
}

MakeChange([1, 5, 10, 25], 60, console.log.bind(console));
</pre>
<p>
First, we take care of some base cases.
To make change for zero cents, we simply use zero coins.
And it's not possible to make
change for a nonzero amount with no coins.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, we take the highest denomination coin
and try using zero of them, then one of them, and so on,
until we exceed the total amount necessary.
</p>
<p>
There are related problems, such as determining whether
a particular amount of change can even be made, given a
collection of denominations
and calculating
<a HREF="http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Coin_Change">
the number of ways change can be made</a>
rather than enumerating them.
But I like enumeration problems.</p>

		<p>@Maurits: With an attitude like that (referring to the rules in the linked blog post) the US will never eliminate pennies ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5UT04p5f7U" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5UT04p5f7U</a> ) nor displace the $1 bill with the $1 coin ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.dollarcoinalliance.org/facts-about-the-dollar-coin/">http://www.dollarcoinalliance.org/facts-about-the-dollar-coin</a> ) &#8211; both things that currency-issuing authorities in other regions of this world have accomplished.</p>
<p>Also, I would be interested to know if there is a way to incoporporate non-monetary items such as HOPE into the change algorithm&#8230;. No? I never thought so either. &lt;/politics&gt;</p>

		<p>@Brian_EE: Yes, because of attitude. They keep trying to make [maybe entice is a better verb here] people use dollar coins, but it does not take hold because US citizens like what they like. In private enterprise, the company that attempts to market an unpopular product will cut losses and look for a better alternative (such as reinvesting in their more popular, proven products). In government, if something fails (such as Amtrak), well we must give it more funding!</p>

		<p>I think a slight tweak would make this work more like real world conditions. If the coins array is an array of objects like this: &quot;{ coin: 25, count: 5 }&quot; then the for loop can decrement the per coin count and test for 0 so the coin drawer need not contain an infinite amount of each coin type.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve long been interested in a related problem: if I have sufficient coins and so does the teller, how much should I overpay to minimize the number of coins exchanged? or the number of coins I get back?</p>
<p>For example, if I owe $0.48, I could pay with a quarter, two dimes and three pennies, receiving nothing back (6 coins exchanged). Or I could pay with two quarters and get two pennies back (four coins exchanged).</p>

		<p>@Ross Presser: My goal is usually &quot;What transaction minimizes the weight in my pocket.&quot; So, now we should also factor in the weight of each coin and optimize around weight exchanged (maximum given by consumer, minimum returned by teller).</p>

		<p>@Ross Presser, Brian EE, others: my goal when using coin currency is &quot;how many of those damn pennies can I use?&quot; I typically have a small number of pennies floating around in my wallet that are damn near useless for most of my cash transactions. &nbsp;On the rare occasion where pennies can help me make exact change, then I&#39;ll try to unload as many of them as possible, even if that means exchanging more coins than necessary. Otherwise, when I get home, I dump the pennies into a jar and, when it&#39;s full, take it somewhere that I can turn it into a more useful form of currency.</p>

		<p>Another refinement of this algorithm would be to determine at the beginning what the smallest denomination of coinage is and round to that, for countries where there are no denominations of 1 anymore:</p>
<p>function RoundValue(coins, total) {</p>
<p> &nbsp;coins = coins || [];</p>
<p> &nbsp;var roundTo = null;</p>
<p> &nbsp;coins.forEach(function(x) { if ((roundTo === null) || (x &lt; roundTo)) roundTo = x; });</p>
<p> &nbsp;if ((roundTo &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (total &gt; 0)) {</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;var roundAmt = total % roundTo;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;if (roundAmt &lt; Math.round(roundTo / 2))</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return total &#8211; roundAmt;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;else</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return total + (roundTo &#8211; roundAmt);</p>
<p> &nbsp;} else { return 0; }</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>function MakeChange(coins, total, f) {</p>
<p> &nbsp;total = RoundValue(coins, total);</p>
<p> &nbsp;[&#8230;]</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>(Naturally, this would only be required for coins as debit and credit card transactions do not normally round!)</p>

		<p>@alegr1: I would gladly give up dollar bills for dollar coins. I&#39;m in the &quot;pro&quot; camp on that. I don&#39;t see that ti conflicts with minimizing weight of the coins I do carry when processing a transaction.</p>
<p>@Raymond: &quot;I bring all my pennies when I use self-checkout&quot; &#8211; I refuse to use self-checkout lines. Why should I do the work of scanning and bagging my own purchases (i.e. the &quot;cashier&#39;s job&quot;) when the establishment isn&#39;t discounting my bill for the labor cost savings that they are benefiting from. This has the side benefit of helping to keep cashiers employed.</p>

		<p>When I was a student I had a big bowl of pennies (inherited from friends actually) which we used for playing poker. A friend of mine once counted them &#8211; it contained less than a year&#39;s worth of pennies &#8211; and came to $7.88 if I remember correctly..</p>
<p>Annoying things, still hoping more EU countries get rid of 1 and 2 cent &#8211; heck I&#39;m fine if we get rid of 5 cent too if we&#39;re at it, they don&#39;t really serve any useful purpose apart from obscuring the real price of items..</p>

		<p>I&#39;d say that no one likes to count pennies (or the smallest denomination of any currency, really). &nbsp;Not even me. &nbsp;I used to roll pennies and bring them to the bank regularly, but the face value of a roll of pennies just wasn&#39;t worth the time investment to count out 50 coins (and weed out the occasional Canadian penny); thus, the jar o&#39; pennies. &nbsp;I&#39;ve found it much easier to dump the coins into the nearest coin-counting machine when the jar is full.</p>

		<p>I haven&#39;t used self-checkout much, but I suppose another advantage is that non-technical people are going to avoid it, thus leaving it open for those who have taken the time to learn it. Also, you won&#39;t have the situation where three or four machines are standing there useless, unoccupied, just because the store has no cashiers to spare at the moment.</p>

		<p>&gt; I bring all my pennies when I use self-checkout, because the machine doesn&#39;t get mad when I feed it 30 pennies</p>
<p>Interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>As a former cashier, I can testify that *cashiers* don&#39;t get mad when you feed them 30 pennies. The *people behind you* might get mad if you pull out your change, or your checkbook, or ask for cigarettes.</p>
<p>In all the grocery stores I&#39;ve been to, I&#39;ve noticed that every human cashier has their own dedicated queue, but there is a shared queue for the self-checkout machines. And I&#39;ve seen shared human-cashier queues in plenty of non-grocery stores: Fry&#39;s, Kohl&#39;s, Ross. But I&#39;ve never seen a place with a shared self queue and a shared human-cashier queue.</p>

<p>@Maurits Say what? Every checkout operator I&#39;ve ever known has hated trying to count 30 pennies, and desperately wanted to say something along the lines of &quot;We&#39;re not a damn bank!&quot;</p>

		<p>How to make pennies go:</p>
<p>1. Make everyone to round all cash payments down to the closest 5 cents. $1.21 becomes $1.20, $2.49 becomes $2.45, $3.65 stays $3.65. You can&#39;t round up because then you just charge the payer additional money for nothing.</p>
<p>2. Smelt the damn coins and make a statute of my image from them.</p>
<p>3. ?????</p>
<p>4. PROFIT!</p>

		<p>@Joker_vD:</p>
<p>Actually, in Australia, we DO round to the nearest 5 cents for cash transactions, so a $2.49 purchase would cost you $2.50.</p>

		<p>[I use a different approach. I bring all my pennies when I use self-checkout, because the machine doesn&#39;t get mad when I feed it 30 pennies. -Raymond]</p>
<p>That reminds me of an instance when a friend of mine worked for university&#39;s library, someone pay $500 bill for overdue penalty of $2 on Saturday near closing hour, after he packed all the bank notes above $100 in face-value to safe already.</p>
<p>In the end that &quot;someone&quot; received a few hundred coins as change for what he had done.</p>

		<p>@Neil: Coinstar charges 9% unless you get the money as a gift card for one of their partners.</p>
<p>@Checkout Operator: I put myself through college partly on a 5-year &quot;career&quot; in retail. I&#39;m pretty sure that I can &quot;stand myself&quot;. And if checking out customers is so annoying to you, I might suggest you try a different career. It is only common sense that automation reduces jobs in those industries that employ it (auto is a good case study, there are plenty of papers on the issue). I am also pretty sure that if all people and businesses quit sending items by mail, then the USPS would go out of business &#8211; including those employed.</p>

		<p>@Rick C: how do you mean, pass in coins that do not exist?</p>
<p>Here in the Netherlands, we have prices like 9.99, but we do not use the 1 and 2 cent coins. So 9.99 becomes 10 for those people paying in cash and stays 9.99 for those paying with their card.</p>
<p>If you keep a good tally on your total you can walk away with 2 cents &#39;profit&#39; each time you shop (9.92 would become 9.90).</p>

		<p>Having a 2-cent coin and a 50-cent coin would lighten your pockets, since it would greatly reduce the number of pennies and quarters needed.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
