		<p>While those of us in less advanced &quot;civilizations&quot; (Orlando, FL) that still worship the car as god, just look on with envy.</p>
<p>If you like this sort of thing, don&#8217;t move to Florida. It sucks and the people are really rude.</p>

		<p>All this &quot;free&quot; stuff, but they charge you to park there, despite already getting money from property taxes to support this and other parks.</p>

		<p>Ha, until this I&#8217;d forgotten that Dasani was a big hit in the US. Several of my co-workers use Dasani bottles at work for drinking water because of the irony/ shock value. &quot;Hey, isn&#8217;t that&#8230;?&quot;, &quot;Yeah, I drink it for the healthy glow&quot;.</p>
<p>In the UK as in the US, Dasani was just tap water + industrial chemicals + Coca-Cola marketing muscle, but unfortunately in the UK they more or less deliberately poisoned it with Bromate (sort of inevitably, a carcinogen) while advertising it as &quot;pure&quot; water. Neither the advertising standards body, the water supplier nor the food safety people liked this, and combined with press coverage it killed the brand dead in the UK and took all Coca-Cola&#8217;s plans for Dasani in Europe with it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame they didn&#8217;t do the bike thing here, they&#8217;d probably have abandoned a few thousand perfectly serviceable Dasani branded bikes in the larger parks and cross country cycle routes when they pulled out&#8230;</p>

		<p>Offtopic to the original conversation, but per Dasani &#8211; I really don&#8217;t get it when people get haughty and condescending about Dasani (being from Coke, it has to be imperfect, right?) and its ilk. Dasani might not have spurted out of some random &quot;well&quot; (which could be heavily contaminated with farm runoff, as many &quot;real&quot; bottled waters are), but I think the gist of it all along was that it was heavily filtered, and then remineralized, tap water. Last I looked, most municipalities don&#8217;t use reverse osmosis to filter their water, and largely rely on bulk filters followed by a massive shock of chlorine to keep you from dying from it.</p>

		<p>Yeah from Coke it probably does involve poisoning natives, stealing drinking water that was available for free and generally attempting to corrupt local governments. They are just GREEAATT! Dennis, please keep giving all your money to Coke for crap when in the UK you can buy (for the same price) water that has only certified organic farmland feeding into it. Its the standard mega-glomerate form over fuction.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
