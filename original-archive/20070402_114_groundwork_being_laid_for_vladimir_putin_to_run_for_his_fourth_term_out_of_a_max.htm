<p>The Russian constitution limits the president to two consecutive four-year terms, and Vladimir Putin is coming up on the end of his third. When he ran for his third term, he explained that his first term didn't count since it was served under the old constitution. This explanation appears to have been widely accepted because everybody reports that he is coming up on the end of his second term, not his third. (But I think it's funnier if you think of it as his third.)</p>
<p> Now it appears that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003644652_russia31.html"> the groundwork is being laid</a> for Putin to run for his fourth term. Out of a maximum of two. </p>
<p> I'm not saying he does or doesn't deserve to be president for another term. (And he does say that he plans to step down, though he doesn't rule out the possibility of running again.) I'm just amused by the machinations involved in keeping him there. </p>

		<p>If you count first 4 month as a term that probably makes sence. However he was not elected for that term. I am not sure what Russian constitution says in this case. At least 4 years ago nobody counted those 4 month as a term.</p>

		<p>In the U.S., if you become President with less than two years left in your term (and it is still called a term&amp;mdash;no one says that LBJ or Truman&#8217;s first terms are somehow not a term), you can be President for three terms &quot;out of a maximum of two&quot; in the same way.</p>

		<p>As somebody living in Russia at that time, I can tell you: during that &quot;four month term&quot;, Putin was not officially considered President, but a &quot;person temporarily performing the functions of &nbsp;President&quot;, so it doesn&#8217;t officially count as full fledged presidency; a temporary substitute rather.</p>

		<p>Going by the same token, George Bush should be able to run for presidency again in 2008. In 2000 he was not elected by the people, but was selected by the Supreme court. Hence his first term should not count.</p>

		<p>&quot;you can be President for three terms &#8216;out of a maximum of two&#8217; in the same way.&quot;</p>
<p>Not exactly. &nbsp;The US Constitution specifically provides for not being elected more than twice. &nbsp;It doesn&#8217;t care about number of terms. &nbsp;It merely provides that if you serve more than two years of a term someone else was elected to, then you can only be elected once.</p>
<p>I still think Raymond makes a good point. &nbsp;Whatever you want to call the first four months, there may be some engineering going on to get him a third full term. &nbsp;This is a key distinction and an important time for Russia&#8217;s future. &nbsp;George Washington purposefully stepped down to establish that no one should remain as Executive for life (as he would have won every election until he died). &nbsp;The very idea of how long one is entitled to serve as Russia&#8217;s executive is at stake. &nbsp;That is one of the many considerations he and the other Russian leaders should account for.</p>

		<p>Raymond, take a note, it is not the first campaign for constitution change, in order for Putin to be elected one more mandate. He so far declined it.</p>
<p>Also I think he have so much influence and popularity in Russia, he can rule in shadow without to be the official president and he will do that in order to avoid critics.</p>
<p>And as european, can I critic your system, where your presidents are chosen from so thin oligarchy, that they end being relatives of older presidents? Even i communist times none of the soviet leaders did have a family connection with other one.</p>

		<p>In Germany chancelor Helmut Kohl (there is a president but it is just a figurehead, the real power lies with the chancelor) served four terms in office (16 years) and actually tried to get elected for a fifth, but fortunatelly failed. People actually do get fed up eventually. Still I&#8217;d really love to see the constitution changed to limit this to 2 terms max!</p>

		<p>This is old news. About every two-three months some high official, some party, or representatives of some region suggest making such changes to Constitution, mostly to demonstrate their loyalty to Putin, rather than to actually lay down some groundwork for Putin&#8217;s re-election.</p>
<p>Mironov (head of upper house) is a hired clown. The &quot;opposition&quot; from Gryzlov (head of lower house, famous for quote &quot;parliament is not a place for discussions&quot;) is another clown for hire, and his &quot;opposition&quot; clearly shows the message does not come from the top, and should not be considered seriously (this time).</p>
<p>Of course, nobody doubts that if Putin does decide to take another term, he will easily pass these changes to Constitution. But everyone also understands that such decision should come from Putin or his closest circle (aka Mafia, if it were Italy), not from these clowns.</p>

		<p>You are nearly correct, michen.</p>
<p>But there is also such a thing like public opinion. If Putin decided to for more terms, he obviously needed to do some preparations. And this clown games might be exactly this thing&#8211;the preparation of public opinion.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean external public opinion. Clowns like Gryzlov&amp;Mironov are the instruments to operate internal affairs only. For external manipulation, I believe, they would do very different things. They would create smokescreen, fuss around something unrelated.</p>
<p>They could ask Iran to seize some British ships. The could ask N.Korea to do something dangerous. They have some power to do it, and one cannot underestimate the will for power, when it comes to KGB.</p>

		<p>I thought he was going to run for the Prime Minister position after he couldn&#8217;t be president any more. (Or was that the other way around?)</p>
<p>Scary stuff&#8230;</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s nice to know his opposition is one of the finest tactical minds in the world &#8211; if you&#8217;re a chess piece.</p>

		<p>Putin served for 2 terms. Before that he spent a few months as a prime minister with no president above him (he resigned). So far, no problem here. If he stays for the 3rd term, it&#8217;s a breach of the law. All the references to Netherlands &amp; US laws are completly irrelevant &#8211; Dutch and Americans don&#8217;t consider Russian laws when they elect their own officials. What is important is if the Russian law is broken or not. So far it isn&#8217;t. There&#8217;re talks about doing that, and that&#8217;s alarming.</p>

		<p>a followup:</p>
<p>Back in the Yeltsin&#8217;s days even more people believed that Yeltsin would never step down yet he did. It doesn&#8217;t mean that Putin will do too, I&#8217;m just pointing out that words about keeping Putin in office are just words. So far.</p>

		<p>Would you dare to read the Constitution of Russian Federation at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.constitution.ru/10003000/10003000-6.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.constitution.ru/10003000/10003000-6.htm</a></p>
<p>Articles 81.1, 81.3, 92.1, 92.2, 92.3.</p>
<p>My translation (probably someone can fix it):</p>
<p>92.1. President of the Russian Federation will take the office after taking the oath and leave the office at the end of his tenure since the moment of the oath taking of the newly elected President of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>92.2. President of the Russian Federation, leaves the office early in the event of his resignation, permanent inability of the health of his authority or removal from office. The election of the President of the Russian Federation to be held not later than three months from the early termination of office.</p>
<p>92.3. Whenever the President of the Russian Federation is unable to perform his or her duties, they are temporarily exercised by the Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation. The person acting as President of the Russian Federation do not have the rights to dissolve the State Duma, call a referendum, as well as to propose amendments and revision of the Constitution of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Putin was not a president from 01/2000 &#8211; 03/2000, but temporarily exercised the duties as a president.</p>

		<p>Sorry, but seems like a lot of Russian programmers are reading your blog ;-) Anyway, I think Putin would not accept any offers to go to the next term because he don&#8217;t want to touch a constitution, despite of numerous requests from the governors and other political forces.</p>

		<p>Funnily, russians reading this blog are protecting their government, which is good for the government :) As a matter of fact if referendum was called now to change the constitution for Putin re-election, I bet there would be positive voting for it. Majority supports Putin&#8217;s course even if it is not truly democratic in western sense of the word. I&#8217;ll hope the constitution will stay though.</p>

		<p>If not Putin, then who? Given that Ivanov and Medvedev haven&#8217;t made serious traction yet &#8211; and the &quot;liberal&quot; opposition is its usual shambles &#8211; my question is would the Kremlin really risk the upheaval of having Putin step aside, only to be followed by the great unknown?</p>
<p>That said, Putin was an unknown when Yeltsin made him prime minister in 1999&#8230; a few interestingly timed detonations in the Moscow suburbs changed that.</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>to understand the Russian situation properly, you must know that <em>there are no really attractive public political figures in Russia except Putin</em>. No at all.</p>
<p>So, if honest elections will go in 08, this will be a totally unpredictable game. A choice between, say, 5 equally bad and unpopular candidates is <em>unpredictable</em>. Even a very minor factor of noise can play.</p>
<p>The Russian elite is probably dissatisfied with such unstability, and thus pushes Putin hard to continue the 3rd term (yes, 3rd, the rule from Dec 99 to Mar 00 was not the rule of the <em>elected</em> president, just a temporary figure) like Lukashenko did.</p>
<p>Looks like Putin himself is not so willing to do this, but the ruling elite wants.</p>
<p>More so. There is no need to make false elections. There is only a need to allow Putin to go to elections. He will won for sure, just because there are no other good (or even average) candidates.</p>
<p>Future will show. I can even imagine some bad events in Russia before 08 election.</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>one more Russian MVP :)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
