<p>I always crack a smile whenever I hear or read someone say that "XYZ is our top priority." The person may believe it at the moment they say it, but just wait a little while, and soon there will be a new top priority.</p>
<p> If you call the person out on their shifting priorities, they usually come up with some hand-waving explanation that the two "top" priorities are actually the same thing. </p>
<p> <i>Last week, you said that customer satisfaction was our top priority, but just now you said that our employees' well-being is our top priority. Which one is the real top priority? In other words, which is more important, customer satisfaction or employee well-being?</i> </p>
<p> "Well, you see, if our employees are happy and healthy, that shows itself in the quality of service we provide our customers, so the two are really facets of the same underlying issue. Which is our top priority." </p>
<p> <i>But there can be a conflict between the two. For example, longer hours of operation improve customer service, but it also takes a toll on the workforce. Which goal is more important?</i> </p>
<p> "That's an interesting question. Obviously we would work very hard to try to avoid such a conflict. I'm confident that my leadership team will be able to address both issues without having to sacrifice on either one." </p>
<p> <i>Wait, now they are separate issues again? You said earlier that they were the same issue.</i> </p>
<p> "I think I've answered your question. Anybody else have a question?" </p>

		<p>Well, actually, the mere notion of &quot;priority&quot; is specifically defined WHEN there&#8217;s a conflict.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;re no conflicts, there&#8217;s no need to define priorities.</p>

		<p>I used to work for a company that had this priority problem with projects. At one point it got so bad that priorities were shifting on almost a daily basis. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The upper management would announce &nbsp;everyone is now on project abc, the next day put everyone on project zyx, and later lmno. &nbsp;The problem when this happens is that everything is a priority and yet nothing is, so nothing gets moved forward. Thus a wheel spins in the mud.</p>
<p>Funny thing is while frustrating, I often found myself laughing to myself at the situation, as the other lower level managers, myself included, tried to determine the real priority and further it.</p>

		<p>Well, I&#8217;ve heard managers refer to things as top priorities (emphasis on the ies) rather than just a single top priority.</p>
<p>Of course, that still doesn&#8217;t explain how they rank top priorities against each other.</p>

		<p>The proper way to prioritize your a-list items is to ask your manager, &quot;which one of these top priority items should I work on?&quot;</p>
<p>Preferably without any sarcasm in your voice, and with a straight face.</p>

<p>Dilbert: “Question: Is it more important than safety?</p>
<p>Manager: “Ooh… I forgot about that one.”</p>
<p>Dilbert: “Is quality more important than obeying the law?”</p>
<p>Manager: “Well…, probably not.”</p>

		<p>That problem is caused by the Multimedia Class Scheduler Service, which boosts certain priorities in an effort to compensate for the default braindead scheduling policy. Kinda like how SuperFetch and friends try to compensate for resource managing deficiencies.</p>

		<p>Tends to reveal an organisation with a very limited view of what constitutes &quot;priority&quot;. &nbsp;The first and most productive change I ever make to an issue tracking/job scheduling implementation (when I get the chance) is to split the &quot;Priority&quot; field into two: &nbsp;&quot;Importance&quot; and &quot;Urgency&quot;.</p>
<p>Something can be crucially important but not at all urgent (we mustn&#8217;t forget to do this) and equally it might be critically urgent, but not very important (we promised the customer this fix in next weeks release, even though they could live without it).</p>
<p>&quot;Priority&quot; is then derived from Urgency and Importance. &nbsp;You deal with Important+Urgent issues, then the Urgent issues, then the Important issues and only then deal with anything else that&#8217;s left (by definition, not urgent and not important).</p>

<p>Critical</p>

<li>
<p>Mission-critical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life-and-death</p>

<li>

<p>I would say that important but not urgent comes before urgent but not important, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Even if it is urgent, if it is not important, why bother about it if you have other important tasks? What&#8217;s the point of your split if you use it wrong?</p>
<p>In addition, urgent and not important: wait that week promised to the customer and then it is not urgent anymore</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
