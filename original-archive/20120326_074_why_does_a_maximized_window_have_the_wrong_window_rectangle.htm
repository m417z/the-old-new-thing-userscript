<p>Commenter configurator wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040678"> why the maximum size for a form is the screen size plus (12,12)</a>. <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/windowsgeneraldevelopmentissues/thread/6C385334-921A-4ADC-A9B3-593E61D1219B"> Somebody else wonders why it's the screen size plus (16,16)</a>.</p>
<p> Let's start by rewinding the clock to Windows&nbsp;3.0. </p>
<p> When you maximize a window, the default position of the window is such that all the resizing borders hang "off the edges of the screen". The client area extends from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen, and also goes all the way to the bottom. It doesn't go all the way to the top, since it needs to leave room for the caption, but the resizing border that sits above the caption area is not visible either. </p>
<p> The reason for this should be obvious: Since the window is maximized, there's no point wasting screen real estate on the resizing borders. You want the client area to be as large as possible; that's why you maximized the window. </p>
<p> The result of this window positioning is that the window rectangle itself is slightly larger than the screen. The parts that "hang off the edges of the screen" are not visible because, well, they're off the screen. (Of course, if your window had a maximum size smaller than the screen, then those borders stay visible.) The size of these borders might not be 12 pixels, mind you. </p>
<p> This is how things stood for a long time. Even the introduction of multiple monitors in Windows&nbsp;98 didn't affect the way maximized windows were positioned. Multiple monitors, however, altered one of the assumptions that lay behind the positioning of maximized windows, namely the assumption that edges beyond the screen were not visible. I mean, they weren't visible on the screen that held the maximized window, but they <i>were</i> visible on the adjacent monitor. As a result, when you maximized a window, its borders appeared as a sliver on the adjacent monitor. </p>
<p> Why didn't Windows get rid of the sliver when multiple monitors were introduced? You probably know the reason already: Because there are applications which relied on the sliver. For example, an application might detect that it is maximized by checking whether its edges hang off the screen, rather than checking the <code>WS_MAXIMIZED</code> style. Why would they do it that way? Probably because they fumbled around until they found something that seemed to work, sort of like the people who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/17/5478031.aspx"> detect whether the mouse buttons are swapped by calling <code>SwapMouseButton</code> instead of <code>GetSystemMetrics(SM_SWAPBUTTON)</code></a>. (Or maybe because they wanted to treat as "logically maximized" windows which the user had manually resized to be larger than the screen.) </p>
<p> The introduction of the Desktop Window Manager in Windows&nbsp;Vista gave the window manager team a chance to solve the problem without impairing compatibility: The Desktop Window Manager controls how windows appear on the screen, which can be different from the actual window properties. For example, the Desktop Window Manager typically animates a window into position when it becomes visible, yet if an application calls <code>GetWindowRect</code>, it will just see the window at its normal position with no animation. </p>
<p> This decoupling of logical and physical characteristics permits all sorts of visual tricks. The visual trick relevant here is the removal of the overhang borders from a maximized window. The borders are still there: If you call <code>GetWindowRect</code>, you will get the same coordinates you always did. But they don't appear on the screen. The sliver is gone. </p>

		<p>I&#39;m running XP with two monitors, and I don&#39;t see a sliver on my second screen when I maximize something on my primary display, so now I&#39;m curious about how the border hiding was done before the Desktop Window Manager.</p>

		<p>Right, if we could do it over again, we might not &quot;hang the resizing borders off the edge of the screen&quot;, we might re-draw the client window to not have the resizing borders at all. &nbsp;But that might have been more work.</p>

		<p>This is related to an issue that you sometimes have to watch out for when developing your own applications. When your window has a client window that has a border, you may need special casing that turns off (some of) the border(s) or moves them out of sight when the window is maximised. This is especially important when the client window may have scroll bars.</p>

		<p>Another reason for hiding the resizing borders when maximizing is to allow controls (particularly the titlebar buttons) to be flush against the edges of the screen to take advantage of Fitt&#39;s Law.</p>
<p>Hopefully it&#39;s not true in Vista and later now, but an annoying side effect of the overhang is that in XP, maximized windows sometimes ended up with resizing borders anyway, such as when the window manager needs to move maximized windows off of a secondary monitor that&#39;s become disabled. &nbsp;And when enabling secondary monitors, sometimes the overhang from maximized windows on the primary monitor would appear on the secondary ones.</p>
<p>That raises a question, though: this article says that the DWM allowed the sliver problem to be solved, but wasn&#39;t it sort of solved already? &nbsp;In 2000/XP, the sliver wasn&#39;t normally visible (aside from unusual cases like I mentioned above), so the visual and logical characteristics already seemed somewhat decoupled. &nbsp;Is it that the DWM allows the decoupling to be done in a cleaner, more reliable way? &nbsp;How did it work before the DWM? &nbsp;I always figured that the window manager could just set a clipping rectangle for maximized windows.</p>

		<p>A certain major 3rd party photo-editing application trashes a strip of pixels on the side of one monitor when you maximize it on another, and also swallows clicks on that unpainted region.</p>
<p>People who re-invent the standard window-border code to provide their own &quot;cool&quot; (horrendous) alternatives almost always seem to miss several of the cases they are supposed to handle. I wish people would stop doing it.</p>

		<p>Hmmm, some applications that are pretending to reinvent window management on their own (I really hate you, Eclipse!) doing this not right, and in result fricking sliver is clearly present on my second monitor even on Windows 8.</p>

		<p>I often find myself thinking unfriendly things towards those who feel a &quot;need&quot; to replace chunks of standard functionality. I&#39;m sure you do think your music player is the most wonderful application in the world, and those flashing neon strips with animated LOLcats for window controls are much, much prettier than the standard Windows ones &#8211; but if I actually wanted windows that looked like that, I&#39;d have installed that theme. I didn&#39;t, so please don&#39;t assume it&#39;s an oversight and &quot;correct&quot; it for me!</p>
<p>@James Lin: back in the single-monitor days, &quot;drawing&quot; it off-screen would be harmless since it would be outside the clipping region. I don&#39;t recall ever seeing the resize border on the next monitor, I always assumed there was just a special case ensuring they didn&#39;t do that, as indeed we&#39;re told there is for DWM. I have a feeling my WinXP and Win2k test virtual machines support multiple virtual monitors, so I&#39;ll give it a try soon to be sure. Could the Themes mechanism in XP be doing something similar to DWM?</p>

		<p>Yeah, drawing outside of the screen buffer sure worked fine, if you were using an API that automatically performed clipping for you. Not all APIs do. It is mostly the ones that hand you a big pile of bytes and expect you to do everything yourself that lack this.</p>

<p>Hate to tell you this, but I have that problem on my two-month-old Windows 7 laptop. &nbsp;I notice it when plugging/unplugging an external HDMI TV. &nbsp;Keyboard combination Fn+F7 brings up a pop-up window offering to disconnect projector, disconnect internal display, or extend onto both displays. &nbsp;Changing between these options often triggers this exact problem, where the overhangs on maximized windows are no longer placed outside the visible area, exactly like you complain about. &nbsp;I have to restore and then maximize each window to to get rid of the unwanted borders. &nbsp;Really annoying bug.</p>
<p>My guess is the window manager detects that the screen resolution changed, so it resizes each window to fit within the visible areas of the screen, including the maximized ones. &nbsp;The code that does this probably doesn&#39;t provide the special handling needed for maximized windows. &nbsp;Oops.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
