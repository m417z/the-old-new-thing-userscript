<p>The <a href="http://www.clippervacations.com/vessel-information/">Victoria Clipper</a> is a high-speed ferry that runs primarily between Seattle and <strike>Vancouver</strike> Victoria, BC. Early Sunday morning, a man <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Police-suspicious-person-aboard-Victoria-Clipper-5025789.php"> scaled a fence and drove off with one of the boats</a>.</p>
<p> The issue was <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2022377087_stolenclipperxml.html"> resolved without major incident and only minimal damage</a>, which means that it is now open season on jokes! </p>
<p> "Why yes, officer, this <i>is</i> my ferry. I must have left the registration in my other pants." </p>
<p> According to the vessel superindendent, "There is a joystick and he thought it was like an Xbox," ending up driving the boat in circles. You can see the GPS track <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/gallery/news/photos-police-coast-guard-respond-stolen-victoria-/gCGHM/#4184047"> here</a> (photo 19). </p>
<p> Of course, if the thief had had a Kinect, he would have used the voice control. "Clipper, go to West Seattle. Clipper! Go. To. West. Seattle. CLIPPER!" (Waves arms frantically.) </p>
<p> Or maybe the Clipper would have responded, "Hi, I'm Clipper! It looks like you're trying to go to West Seattle. I can help you with this. Is this a personal trip or a business trip?" </p>
<p> Even the Seattle Police Department joined in the festivities, using a popular hashtag for the incident. </p>

		<p>Raymond, totally unrelated question. What happened to Michel Kaplan&#39;s blog? Since he published an article on Hardware partners last week his blog seems to have disappeared from blogs.msdn.com, I am getting &quot;Resource Not Found&quot; error. Did MS boot him?</p>

		<p>Yeah. So according to the linked articles the guy&#39;s had repeated convictions, is a registered sex offender, and has been called a danger to the community on a previous occasion by a judge. Good thing he got picked up before he decided to do something worse to satisfy a whim or to get 15 minutes of fame. Oh, here&#39;s a joke: Wonder if he put a &quot;Kids Ride Free&quot; sign on the boat before heading off.</p>

		<p>I was trying the available translations for this article. Curiously, in Hindi, it says वैंकूवर, ई. पू. for Vancouver, BC where B. C. is translated ईसा पूर्व for Before Christ. Any other translation has this oddity? I see German sticking to &quot;BC&quot; and French doing the British Columbia expansion.</p>
<p>On the Hindi translation itself, pretty good translation overall, though जीपीएस, as expected is &quot;GPS&quot; transliterated , but funnily enough, so is &quot;Business&quot;, बिज़नेस. Also, &quot;Waves&quot; got translated as लहरों which is waves but of the oceanic kind and &quot;arms&quot; became &quot;शस्त&quot;, weapons. &quot;Waves arms frantically&quot; becomes &quot;ocean waves weapon madness&quot;</p>

		<p>You can inform the translation service by clicking on the out-of-sorts translations and clicking the &quot;improve translation&quot; drop-down then giving your improved translation there.</p>

		<p>&quot;The ferry goes to Victoria, not Vancouver!&quot;</p>
<p>But Victoria, BC is on Vancouver Island &#8211; so both are (at least somewhat) correct!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
