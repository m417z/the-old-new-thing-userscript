<p>
Remember,
Microspeak is not merely for jargon exclusive to Microsoft,
but it's jargon that you need to know. 
</p>
<p>
The abbreviation POR stands for <i>plan of record</i>.
It is always spelled out when spoken: <i>P-O-R</i>,
and the <i>O</i> is usually uppercase even though it stands
for a word that is not normally capitalized in titles.
</p>
<p>
The <i>plan of record</i> represents the agreed-upon plan for how
a feature will behave.
Used without any particular context, it generally refers to
how the feature will behave when it is complete.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
The above video shows our current thinking, but it is not POR.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Translation:
The above video shows what the team is currently thinking about
how the feature would work,
but the final decision as to whether the feature will actually work
that way has not yet been made.
</p>
<p>
The plan for how the feature will behave when it
is complete
may be different from the plan for how the
feature will behave at the end of the current milestone.
For example, the plan for the current milestone may be
that the feature works only in limited cases,
but the feature is expected to work in more general cases when it
is complete.
</p>
<p>
The term <i>POR</i> may be qualified to reflect the agreed-upon plan for a
particular milestone.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
The POR for the first Windows Insiders update in August
is to support feature X.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A plan of record is arrived at after consulting with partner
teams and other stakeholders.
Until everybody has agreed to the plan,
it is not yet a plan <i>of record</i>.
</p>
<p>
Note that a plan of record is not immutable.
Changes in circumstances may require revisions to the plan of record.
</p>
<p>
The scope of a plan of record can be something other than a feature.
It could be a process.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
This is the
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140722-00/?p=433">
tell mode</a>
POR for the Anniversary Update.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Translation:
Team leadership agreed that this is how tell mode will operate
for the Anniversary Update.
</p>
<p>
As with most Microspeak,
the usage of the term can change in ways that no longer
grammatically reflect the phrase for which it is an abbreviation.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
It appears that feature X is disabled.
Is that POR?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice how the definite article <i>the</i> was dropped
from the question.</p>

		<p>Doesn&#8217;t that make POR an entirely meaningless term, though?</p>
<p>I mean, if the plan for Milestone X is to get Features Y and Z to work, then surely the only plan worth considering is the plan for Milestone X.  This is, after all, the Agile (hawk, spit) Way.  YAGNI, and so on.</p>
<p>Leaving Agile to one side (please do), there seems to be little point to qualifying &#8220;the current plan&#8221; as &#8220;it&#8217;s not the POR, because we don&#8217;t actually have a plan for that, or indeed a record against which to measure the plan that we know we don&#8217;t have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some MicroSpeaks have intrinsic (if occasionaly inscrutable) value.  This one just sounds like one that a particularly dense Program Manager (not one of mine &#8212; they were all Einsteins) would come out with.</p>

		<p>The term is useful because it denotes that the plan has been agreed to by all parties, as opposed to a proposed plan or an interim plan. (I don&#8217;t understand what your first paragraph is trying to say.)</p>

		<p>These Microspeak articles never fail to impress me.  The evolution of language, especially in such a small microcosm where, for the outside layman it appears everyone&#8217;s doing the same thing (&#8220;writing computer programs&#8221;), is fascinating.</p>
<p>For this one though, I&#8217;d never heard of this term and I hope I don&#8217;t allow it to infect my vocabulary :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
