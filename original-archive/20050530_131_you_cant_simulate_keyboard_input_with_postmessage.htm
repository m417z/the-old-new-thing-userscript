<p>Some people attempt to simulate keyboard input to an application by posting keyboard input messages, but this is not reliable for many reasons.</p>
<p> First of all, keyboard input is a more complicated matter than those who imprinted on the English keyboard realize. Languages with accent marks have dead keys, Far East languages have a variety of Input Method Editors, and I have no idea how complex script languages handle input. There's more to typing a character than just pressing a key. </p>
<p> Second, even if you manage to post the input messages into the target window's queue, that doesn't update the keyboard shift states.  When the code behind the window calls <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardinput/keyboardinputreference/keyboardinputfunctions/getkeystate.asp"> the <code>GetKeyState</code> function</a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardinput/keyboardinputreference/keyboardinputfunctions/getasynckeystate.asp"> the <code>GetAsyncKeyState</code> function</a>, it's going to see the "real" shift state and not the fake state that your posted messages have generated. </p>
<p> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardinput/keyboardinputreference/keyboardinputfunctions/sendinput.asp"> The <code>SendInput</code> function</a> was designed for injecting input into Windows. If you use that function, then at least the shift states will be reported correctly.  (I can't help you with the complex input problem, though.) </p>

		<p>I&#8217;m looking at the documentation about SendInput() and feel that something is missing. How do specify the target program or window to send the input? &#8211; no param of SendInput, no member in INPUT structure &#8230; is it only used to send input to my-self?</p>

		<p>Toma, you don&#8217;t</p>
<p>SendInput() simulate keyboard/mouse event at lowest possible level. When you press a key on keyboard, you alse have no control where this click will go. You should make required window to have focus in order to receive keyboard events from SendInput()</p>

		<p>I have no idea how a computer works in any language but EN-AUS (I believe EN-US is a copy of EN-AU). I do troubleshoot foreign input. THERE IS NO DOCUMENTATION (apart from translating Edit/Copy/Paste for the UI &#8211; semi-relevent).</p>

		<p>MS should really depracate all these Win32 horrors. It&#8217;s obvious when talking about computers that people and developers want to automate tasks including those the original developer did not see that anyone would like to automate a task such as trying all possible permutations of passwords or making it look like to the computer that its the user who is initiating the delete partition command or clicking all those adds in the explorer. Why did MS not see this need?</p>

		<p>new thing:<br />
<br />&quot;did not see that anyone would like to automate a task such as trying all possible permutations of passwords or making it look like to the computer that its the user who is initiating the delete partition command or clicking all those adds in the explorer.&quot;<br />
<br />There are way better ways to achieve this.<br />
<br />You have automation using COM, and Active Accessibility. The adds in Explorer are also accessible with the Explorer automation. Sending a mouse click is easy, finding them is difficult.<br />
<br />Many things can be achieved quite easy. You can SetWindowText, instead of sending one character at a time. You can send WM_COMMAND with IDOK instead of clicking the OK button.<br />
<br />The main problem with this is that the methods are not generic enough.</p>
<p>I am not saying it is easy, but is not as difficult as you think.</p>

		<p>Where can I find more information on the handling of complex scripts such as Arabic? Is there aything public? </p>
<p>Also, is there no way to bypass GetKeyState or is this too deep in the basic functionality? There&#8217;s SetKeyboardState which I&#8217;d expect would be able to force a state.</p>

		<p>Since someone asked, this is what I&#8217;ve done:</p>
<p>To send keyboard input to another process using SendInput() you&#8217;ll have to<br />
<br />use AttachThreadInput(,,TRUE) using the main thread id of the target app AND<br />
<br />your app&#8217;s thread id (I used GetWindowThreadProcessId()). Now input normally<br />
<br />going to your app now goes to another including stuff sent using<br />
<br />SendInput(). MAKE SURE you unattach using AttachThreadInput(,,FALSE) when<br />
<br />you&#8217;re done.</p>

		<p>Attaching input queues has far-ranging consequences. Make sure you know what you&#8217;re doing.</p>

		<p>Other issues with using PostMessage to simulate keyboard (or mouse for that matter) activity are:</p>
<p>Keyboard and Mouse hooks will not get called. These hooks only get called for &quot;real&quot; mouse and keyboard input (keybd_event, mouse_event and SendInput are all alternate ways of generating &quot;real&quot; keyboard and mouse input).</p>
<p>The queue state (obtained using the GetQueueStatus API) will not reflect the correct state.</p>
<p>If you are waiting using the MsgWaitForMultipleObjects API and have specified QS_KEY or QS_MOUSE as your wake mask, you will NEVER be woken up.</p>
<p>Basically a posted message of WM_KEYxxx or WM_MOUSExxx is just that, a posted message. It will be treated as one by Windows. Of course, you will still be able to fool most applications using  PostMessage because most applications simply call PeekMessage or GetMessage and use the resultant message.</p>

		<p>I have input problems when using VNC (a freeware Remote Desktop replacement). I can&#8217;t type hebrew into the remote computer, even if both that computer&#8217;s keyboard and mine are set to Hebrew.</p>
<p>And of course, my and the remote computer&#8217;s keyboards can get out of sync &#8211; if he&#8217;s initially in Hebrew and I&#8217;m in English, pressing Alt-Shift will just reverse both. It&#8217;s more fun when I have 3 languages and he has 2&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
