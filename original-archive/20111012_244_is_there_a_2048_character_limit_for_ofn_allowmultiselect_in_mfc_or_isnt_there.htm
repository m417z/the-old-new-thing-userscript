<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dk77e5e7(VS.80).aspx"> The MFC documentation for <code>CFile&shy;Dialog</code></a> contains the following strange warning:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> When the user allocates their own buffer to accommodate <code>OFN_<wbr>ALLOW&shy;MULTI&shy;SELECT</wbr></code>, the buffer can't be larger than 2048 or else everything gets corrupted (2048 is the maximum size). </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The sudden informality of the phrase "or else everything gets corrupted" is surprising but also sounds vaguely familiar to me. I think I was the one who wrote that phrase over a decade ago as part of my investigation into a defect in the common dialog functions. Somebody must have forwarded my analysis to the MFC documentation team (since the problem was originally in an MFC application), who just copied and pasted it into the official documentation. </p>
<p> The limitation in question existed in Windows&nbsp;95 and was fixed in Windows NT&nbsp;4 and Windows&nbsp;98, so the remarks do not apply to any modern version of Windows. </p>
<p> What struck me is that the MFC documentation picked up this limitation rather than deferring to the Platform SDK team to document the issue. It means that when the bug is fixed in the platform, the MFC documentation becomes wrong. </p>
<p> The limitation is not mentioned in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dk77e5e7(VS.90).aspx"> Visual Studio 2008 version of the <code>CFile&shy;Dialog</code> documentation</a>, which suggests either that the Visual Studio folks deferred documenting the issue to the Platform SDK team, or they somehow figured out that the issue no longer applied and removed the offending text. </p>

		<p>Documentation is always a problem.</p>
<p>Unless it is right next to the code (like Doxygen comments), you can count on it to get out-of-date. And even if it is right next to the code, you cannot be sure it will be kept up-to-date.</p>

		<p>I am willing to bet that the phrase &quot;or else everything gets corrupted&quot; was what made it catch their attention and start investigating the issue. If anything it is quite vague and at the same time seems to indicate serious results.</p>
<p>As for anyone wanting to complain about it being unprofessional, remember the expected receiver and not where it ended up.</p>

		<p>&quot;Once the number 2048, being 2^11, be reached, then overflowest thou the buffer towards the direction of the system structures, which, being unprotected by memory management, shall snuff it.&quot; </p>

		<p>&quot;What struck me is that the MFC documentation picked up this limitation rather than deferring to the Platform SDK team to document the issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Since the whole point of MFC was to insulate you from the platform, surely deferring to the platform documentation would be the wrong thing to do. It would instantly double the amount of documentation you had to read to be sure you understood a given MFC API.</p>

		<p>How exactly does this error work? The only way I can think of that making a buffer too large can cause corruption is if that buffer&#39;s size controls an overflow check that is being relied on to avoid overflowing a <em>different</em> (fixed size of 2048, presumably) buffer &#8211; but then what&#39;s the point of allowing the user to allocate a buffer at all if there&#39;s already an internal buffer?</p>
<p>The other possibility is that it&#39;s causing an arithmetic overflow in some sort of allocation of [again] an internal buffer. But what would it be being multiplied by that would overflow?</p>

		<p>Random832: Assume that there is a function which stack-allocates a buffer of size 2048, but initializes nMaxFile of it. This works fine if nMaxFile &lt;= 2048, but corrupts the stack otherwise. The reason you have to allocate your own buffer is that the function can&#39;t return a pointer to its buffer on the stack.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have the source handy, but surely somebody who reads this can find the source for MFC from 1995 and find out exactly what the problem was.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
