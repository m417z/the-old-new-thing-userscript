You too can use your psychic powers to debug the following problem:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
We have a problem with opening documents with our application
by double-clicking them in Explorer.
What's really strange is that if we connect a debugger to Explorer
and set a breakpoint on <code>kernel32!CreateProcessW</code>,
then wait a moment after <code>CreateProcess</code> returns,
then hit '<code>g</code>',
then the document opens fine.
But if we don't wait, then the application launches but the
document does not open.
Instead, you get the error message "Windows cannot find
'abc.lit'. Make sure you typed the name correctly,
and then try again."
Here is the command we are executing when we run into this problem:
</p>
<pre>
"F:\Program Files\LitSoft\LitWare\LitWare.exe" /dde
</pre>
<p>
What is wrong?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you've been reading carefully and paid attention to the explanation of
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/dataexchange/dynamicdataexchange/usingdynamicdataexchange.asp">
how document launching via DDE works</a>,
then you already know what the problem is.
</p>
<p>
Recall that launching documents via DDE is done by first
looking for a DDE server and if none is found, launching
a server manually and trying again.
The command line above was clearly registered as the
<code>command</code> associated with a
<code>ddeexec</code>.
There are two giveaway clues.
First is the fact that the document name itself is not present anywhere
on the command line.
(This couldn't be a direct execution because the program wouldn't know
what document it's supposed to be opening!)
But the
giveaway clue is the phrase <code>/dde</code> on the command line.
</p>
<p>
Clearly, something is going wrong when Explorer attempts the
second DDE conversation to open the document.
The fact that making Explorer wait a few seconds fixes the
problem makes the cause obvious:
The DDE server is being slow to get itself initialized and listening.
Explorer launches the server and tries to talk to it,
but the server is not yet ready and therefore doesn't respond to
the DDE initiate.
</p>
<p>
But how do you fix this?
</p>
<p>
The shell assumes that a DDE server is ready to accept connections
when it goes input idle.
Once <code>WaitForInputIdle</code> on the DDE server returns,
Explorer will make its second attempt at initiating a DDE conversation.
The fix is for the application to get its DDE server up and running
before it starts pumping messages.
My guess is that the application moved its DDE server
to a background thread to improve startup performance,
since the DDE server is not involved in normal program operation.
Too bad the program forgot to get the DDE server up and running
prior to going input idle when the <code>/dde</code> flag is passed.
The one time it's important to have the DDE server running and it
misses the boat.
</p>
<p>
Moral of the story:
If you're going to act as a DDE server,
make sure you do so before your primary thread starts pumping messages.
Otherwise you have a race condition between your application startup
and the shell trying to talk to it.</p>

<p>OK, I&#8217;ll accept that this much is clear to a programmer with a<br />
  moderate amount of psychic powers and a moderate understanding of DDE.<br />
  &nbsp;But let&#8217;s rewind a bit.</p>
<p>&gt; you get the error message &#8220;Windows cannot<br />
  <br />&gt; find &#8216;abc.lit&#8217;. Make sure you typed the name<br />
  <br />&gt; correctly, and then try again.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a maybe moderate or maybe lesser amount of psychic powers and<br />
  maybe with or without moderate understandings of what Windows might be<br />
  thinking at various times, I&#8217;ve had enough experiences with Windows<br />
  saying that Windows can&#8217;t find files that explorer is showing me, and<br />
  have had Windows tell me to make sure I typed a double-click correctly.<br />
  &nbsp;I am well aware of my frequent typos, but I know how to<br />
  distinguish whether I typed a name correctly or not from whether<br />
  Windows blames my typing for Windows&#8217; inability to find what I<br />
  double-clicked on. &nbsp;And you complain about my cynicism.</p>
<p>No, I do not think my psychic powers are enough to debug this kind<br />
  of bug from the kind of s*it messages that Windows displays. &nbsp;And<br />
  you complain about my cynicism. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t you think there&#8217;s just a<br />
  wee possibility that this error message from Windows leaves something<br />
  to be desired?</p>

<p>You&#8217;re welcome. &nbsp;An error message from Windows wouldn&#8217;t be<br />

  (&#8220;Windows cannot find &#8216;abc.lit'&#8221;) even when you&#8217;ve diagnosed that the<br />
  application is at fault, and you want Windows to continue persuading<br />
  people to blame Windows. &nbsp;Plus Windows is going to continue with<br />
  its insulting &#8220;Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try<br />
  again.&#8221; &nbsp;When people meet you at parties and say they hate you,<br />
  it&#8217;s not because I asked them to, it&#8217;s because your company asked them<br />

<p>True. &nbsp;Windows&#8217;s instruction to a double-clicker to check their typing is both sucky and insulting, and the reason isn&#8217;t because suckage is the same as insulting (they&#8217;re not the same), the reason is simply because that instruction is both. &nbsp;Some of us get used to these insults when we&#8217;ve seen them for 10 years, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that new users will be less insulted by them. &nbsp;I do see that a fix might not be easy, and for the foreseeable future you can&#8217;t avoid teaching new users to hate Microsoft. &nbsp;I can&#8217;t help it either, sorry.

<p>Raymond, the problem people have with this message is that what Windows is saying at the moment is just confusing. &nbsp;The file &#8216;abc.lit&#8217; clearly exists, the user will say, it&#8217;s right here. &nbsp;Why can&#8217;t Windows find it?</p>
<p>Windows should definitely distinguish the case that the document can&#8217;t be found and its associated application can&#8217;t. &nbsp;Perhaps &quot;Windows was unable to open &#8216;abc.lit&#8217; because of an application error.&quot; or something similar. &nbsp;It doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated, it just has to represent the truth of what happened, rather than the current message which is blatantly misleading and is likely to have the user barking up the wrong tree for ages trying to figure out what&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p>This is one of the problems a lot of people have with Windows: it spends too much time trying to protect the user and not enough making sure they have enough information to fix whatever&#8217;s wrong. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Error messages that say one thing&#8217;s wrong when it&#8217;s actually something entirely different that&#8217;s wrong don&#8217;t help anyone. &nbsp;It would be as useful to pop up a box that says, &quot;I&#8217;m sorry, I can&#8217;t do that Dave&quot; or something.<br /></p>

<br />&gt; this error?</p>
<p>Complain to the maker of the application?</p>
<p>Historically some makers occasionally fixed bugs when informed about them, though that&#8217;s rare today.</p>
<p>Some makers still don&#8217;t require upfront fees before letting victims complain about bugs.</p>
<p>Maybe the user can also discover that in the future they wish to buy a competing application instead of the buggy application. &nbsp;If the buggy application doesn&#8217;t come from a monopoly, they might even have the power to follow through on this wish.</p>
<p>Maybe eventually people will stop blaming Windows when the bug belongs to an application. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a long row to hoe before this message can sink in, but every journey starts with a single step. &nbsp;Hypothetically this could be such a step.</p>

		<p>I totally agree with Norman. As long as bugs aren&#8217;t revealed correctly, users don&#8217;t learn who&#8217;s really at fault and vendors don&#8217;t feel they need to fix things.</p>
<p>Raymond, I&#8217;ve heard programmers argue against fixing something because they think the user will blame Windows! I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve submitted website bug reports, only to be told by a 1st-level tech support weenie that I should upgrade IE, or update Windows, or go read some MS KB. Even after I tell them I&#8217;ve done all those things!</p>
<p>Remember that long Samba bug discussion&#8230; make the users pissed at Linksys or Netgear or whoever sold them the box &#8211; that&#8217;s the only way to make the vendor fix things.<br /></p>

<p>The KB article is more often never read before than already read, however.</p>
<p>And yes, the NAS manufactor is the only that can be blamed for not updating Samba.</p>

Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
