		<p>@Mark Knell:</p>
<p>That&#39;s explained in the first link:</p>
<p>&quot;According to Chinese lunar calendar, the 15th day of the 8th month is the exact midst of autumn, so it&#39;s called the Mid-Autumn Festival.&quot;</p>

		<p>There are a couple things I&#39;m not sure I understand correctly from the article &#8211; is it saying that a mooncake costs $50 &#8211; $100? &nbsp;That&#39;s some pastry!</p>
<p>Also, Haagen-Dazs sells these vouchers with a short expiration date (&quot;After the festival&#39;s over, all these vouchers will be expired&quot;), essentially expecting that a large percentage will go unfulfilled? &nbsp;That&#39;s quite the business model&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve never liked moon cakes personally. &nbsp;The pastry part is thin so it&#39;s not that much different from eating red bean paste (or lotus seed paste, one of the other common fillings) straight from the can.</p>

		<p>mikeb: it&#39;s not only mooncake and Haagen-Dazs. Most business offering gift certificate make money both ways on them. First by ensuring that whoever receives it will have to buy from their shop, second by knowing very well that some will expire or never be redeemed.</p>
<p>Interestingly (or not!), Quebec recently passed a law forbidding expiry dates on gift certificates.</p>

		<p>Mark Knell: Additionally, in a way that could be called &quot;strictly astronomical&quot;, the equinox is the middle of autumn (or spring), as in this way the longest or shortest day is the middle of summer or winter.</p>

		<p>Raymond: I went to buy some moon cakes in a Chinatown bakery today, and another customer asked for 红豆沙馅, your favorite. The girl behind the counter said &quot;we don&#39;t have any because it&#39;s too sweet and it&#39;s bad for your health&quot;. And so I bought two 双黄莲蓉, which is about 55% cholesterol.</p>

		<p>Pierre B.: There&#39;s a third way gift certificates make money: getting money now for product in the future (they are effectively loans).</p>

		<p>Pierre, Massachusetts has a similar law, which also applies to gift cards, and limits the fees that can be charged on them.</p>

		<p>Bleh, I have my moon cakes the unflavored kind (the ones with eggyolks in them, sans yolks. I give the yolks to a more appreciative family member, though.)</p>
<p>Not one of my favorite treats though. (Not a fan of lotus seed paste nor red bean.)</p>

		<p>mikeb: it&#39;s mooncake futures, with no requirement to Exchange For Physical at the end of the contract. That enables the holder of the futures contract to trade it to the highest bidder. The actual suppliers don&#39;t have to make all that many real mooncakes, because the obligation is satisfied by the paper mooncakes.</p>
<p>The crude oil market works much the same way: the price you see quoted on the news are the futures prices. More paper oil is traded than real oil is extracted. Unfortunately the price you pay at the filling station is based on the futures price for crude oil, for futures are claimed to have a &#39;price discovery&#39; function. This is how oil managed to hit $147 a barrel in the middle of a recession, with traffic levels falling and actual crude inventories climbing. (In North America, gasoline futures are also traded, so the discovered pump price is based on the gas futures price rather than crude oil, but the two tend to move together.)</p>

		<p>@Gabe: Just think about having fruit icecream blocks be frozen for a few days to mark it real hard, then dip it in molten chocolate to give it a chocolate &quot;shell&quot;.</p>
<p>I know someone who claims to have received so much mooncakes that he have to eat it breakfast-lunch-dinner began from last week. That&#39;s pretty unbelievable for me.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: Yes, I also can believe on the number of mooncake received (actually my family also received 10+ boxes). Just cannot believe he eat mooncake day-and-night for more than one week.</p>
<p>I&#39;d taken all mooncakes received 1 week before Mid-Autumn festival to food bank, so the volunteers just deliver them to the poors right before Mid0Autumn festival. That makes the amount my family have to consume down to 4 boxes.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
