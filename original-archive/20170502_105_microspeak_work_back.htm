<p>
A <i>work-back schedule</i>
is a schedule
created by taking a final deadline
and "working backwards"
in order to determine intermediate deadlines.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose we want our feature to
go out in the last Windows Insider build of
the year, so that we can gather results
during the holiday break.
The Windows Insider team tells us that
their last build of the year will the one
built on, say, Friday, December 16.
</p>
<p>
Now we start working backward.
</p>
<p>
Suppose we are following
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130820-00/?p=3453">
the hypothetical RI schedule I used when discussing train jargon</a>,
and our feature is being developed by team A2.
According to that schedule,
changes from branch&nbsp;A are pushed to the trunk every Monday,
and changes from branch&nbsp;A2 are pushed to branch&nbsp;A
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, in order for the feature to reach the trunk
by Friday, December 16,
it must be in branch&nbsp;A by
Monday, December 12.
And in order for the feature to be in
branch&nbsp;A by Monday, December 12,
it must be in branch&nbsp;A2
by Thursday, December 8.
</p>
<p>
Suppose you decide to leave a week to
let the feature
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060213-09/?p=32313">
<i>bake</i></a>;
during that week,
you fix bugs and possibly even disable
some parts of the feature if they don't look
like they're going to be stable enough to go out to Insiders.
(Using the jargon:
Those parts of the feature didn't
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130716-00/?p=3793">
<i>land</i></a>.)
</p>
<p>
Okay, so that means that all the feature work needs to be complete
by Thursday, December 1.
And then you look at your estimates for each of the tasks that
need to be completed, subtract them from December 1,
and come up with a schedule that sets the deadline for each
of the tasks, so that everything gets done in time.
</p>
<p>
That is your <i>work-back schedule</i>,
also called a
<i>work-back plan</i>.
</p>
<p>
Microspeak naturally abbreviates the term and just calls
it a
<i>work-back</i>.
It is common to omit the hyphen and call it a <i>workback</i>.
</p>
<p>
From that abbreviation, we then get derived terms.
In the example above, somebody might say,
"The Windows Insider release
<!-- backref: Microspeak: snap -->
snaps</a>
on December 16,
and if you <i>work it back</i>,
that means we need to make a go/no-go decision
on December 8."</p>

		<p>The article description incorrectly says &#8220;Start and the end and work backwards.&#8221;<br />
Should be &#8220;Start at the&#8230;&#8221;<br />
I had to start at the end of the sentence and work backwards to figure out what you meant.</p>

		<p>Why proof read, when you can crowd source corrections !<br />
Besides, with the volume of articles &#8211; I&#8217;m happy to have the proof reading skipped.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
