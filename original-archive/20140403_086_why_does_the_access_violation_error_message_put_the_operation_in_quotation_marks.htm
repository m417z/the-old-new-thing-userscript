<p>When an application crashes with an access violation, the error message says something like</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The instruction at "XX" referenced memory at "YY". The memory could not be "read". </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Why is the operation in quotation marks? Is this some sort of euphemism? </p>
<p> The odd phrasing is a consequence of globalization. The operation name is a verb in the infinitive ("read", "write"), but depending on how the containing message is localized, it may need to take a different form. Since the kernel doesn't understand grammar, it just puts the words in quotation marks to avoid having to learn every language on the planet. Imagine if it tried: </p>
<blockquote><p> The memory could not be readed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The kernel tried to form the passive, which is normally done in English by adding "&ndash;ed" to the end of the verb. Too bad "read" and "write" are irregular verbs! </p>
<p> The more conventional solution for this type of problem is to create a separate error message for each variant so that the text can be translated independently. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688118.aspx#EMB"> rather than building sentences at runtime</a>, </p>
<p> The access violation error message is in a pickle, though, because the underlying status code is <code>STATUS_<wbr>ACCESS_<wbr>VIOLATION</wbr></wbr></code>, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc704588%28prot.20%29.aspx"> that message contains three insertions</a>, one for the instruction address, one for the address being accessed, and one for the operation. If there were three different status codes, like <code>STATUS_<wbr>ACCESS_<wbr>VIOLATION_<wbr>READ</wbr></wbr></wbr></code>, <code>STATUS_<wbr>ACCESS_<wbr>VIOLATION_<wbr>WRITE</wbr></wbr></wbr></code>, and <code>STATUS_<wbr>ACCESS_<wbr>VIOLATION_<wbr>EXECUTE</wbr></wbr></wbr></code>, then a separate string could be created for each. But that's not how the status codes folks decided to do things, and the translation team was stuck having to use the ugly quotation marks. </p>

		<p>I really have always wondered about the awkward phrasing there. I would always read them as some kind of scare quotes or something. Makes you appreciate how good most of Windows is at being localized, that the rare case like this sticks out at you.</p>

		<p>Ah, so the &quot;correct&quot; pronunciation of that error is in fact</p>
<p>The instruction at XX referenced memory at YY. The memory could not be reed</p>
<p>rather than</p>
<p>The instruction at XX referenced memory at YY. The memory could not be red</p>
<p>since it is talking about the operation &quot;to read&quot; rather than the statement &quot;was read&quot;?</p>

		<p>This is weird, because I remember the action word actually being in the past tense: </p>
<p>My memory may be tricking me, but I remember seeing, on a French Windows 9x, &quot;La mémoire ne peut pas être &quot;written&quot;.&quot; And Google agrees with me.</p>
<p>That would mean the problem is not tense, but rather that the action word is not localized.</p>

		<p>Lisp string formatting has an code to form a plural, see ~P at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node200.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/&#8230;/node200.html</a> where the example shows it can even handle &quot;try&quot;/&quot;tries&quot;.</p>
<p>It would sure be convenient to have that facility in C#, but &#8230; globalization.</p>

		<p>I can&#39;t remember whether it&#39;s ReSharper or Visual Studio&#39;s native ability, but one them when suggesting variable names, when using code templates, generally correctly back works plural collection variables to their singular form. &nbsp;Although I guess working backwards from a plural to a singular might be a bit easier. &nbsp;I&#39;m tempted to find out what it suggest when the plural and singular are the same.</p>

		<p>While I understand the problem in general, in this specific instance, I am wondering why the error message is not phrased to something like</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;The instruction at &quot;XX&quot; referenced memory at &quot;YY&quot;. The &quot;read&quot;-operation could not be performed due to an access violation.</p>
<p>Which prevents the problem in the same way, but sounds way less awkward.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ll jump on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my &quot;most natural language&quot; attempt:</p>
<p>Instruction XX said to (read from/write to/execute) YY, but we couldn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my &quot;most friendly to the status folks and localizer folks&quot; attempt.</p>
<p>Access violation. Source instruction: XX. Target instruction: YY. Attempted access: (read/write/execute)</p>
<p>Both of these fix the use of passive tense (ick.)</p>

<p>True, but you&#39;ve access violated so the situation is already awkward and won&#39;t be smoothed over by correct grammar. This is hopefully a rare situation. And doesn&#39;t Windows now say something generic to the user like &#39;the application has stopped working&#8230; blah blah other stuff about looking for a fix online, reporting it, or whatevs&#39;.</p>

		<p>I&#39;d guess that there&#39;s an aversion to changing the text of error messages where the benefit is low, since it reduces the number of hits when searching the knowledge base or the wider internet. I agree that there could have been better choices of phrase originally.</p>

		<p>@Maurits: &nbsp;Normally I&#39;m a fan of the royal &quot;we&quot;, but I don&#39;t think it works in this situation. &nbsp;Who is &quot;we&quot; here? &nbsp;It&#39;s the operating system. &nbsp;The operating system didn&#39;t try to do the bad operation.</p>
<p>And it just doesn&#39;t sit well with me to present &quot;we&quot; as the nebulous concept of &quot;the computer&quot;. &nbsp;I&#39;m not sure I can articulate why.</p>
<p>Anyway, my personal preference would be not to try to make such a technical error message friendly. &nbsp;I&#39;d rather the message say &quot;The program encounted a problem. &nbsp;Diagnostic info: [at &lt;INSTRUCTION&gt; &lt;ACCESS&gt;:&lt;LOCATION&gt;]&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Maurits: this colon-style is often used in Microsoft software in my native Polish, probably to avoid complex noun inflections. Imagine having such messages all over the place: &quot;Found files: 4&quot; instead of more natural &quot;Found 4 files&quot;. Just because there&#39;s more than one form for plural &quot;files&quot;, depending on the number used.</p>
<p>I understand that localization is a very hard task, but after all those years I think it&#39;s time to finally do it right, language by language.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s interesting that Windows NT smashes most general protection faults into STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION and not just page faults, despite being quite different at a processor level.</p>
<p>Windows NT presumably puts considerable effort toward opcode decoding after an exception, because determining whether a #GP should be a STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION or a STATUS_PRIVILEGED_INSTRUCTION requires decoding the opcode. &nbsp;It&#39;s the same for turning #DE into STATUS_INTEGER_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO versus STATUS_INTEGER_OVERFLOW, where the difference depends on the value of the operand of the &quot;div&quot; instruction.</p>

		<p>@Myria: Yeah. The code behind page faults is messy like that. It decodes the instruction and then resolves the divisor, which might be a register, a memory location or even a SIB byte. It&#39;s not pretty, but it&#39;s also quite nice in that it gives the programmer a unified status code across different platforms that may have rather different types of &quot;something went wrong&quot; exceptions under the hood.</p>

		<p>&gt;It&#39;s interesting that Windows NT smashes most general protection faults into </p>
<p>&gt;STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION and not just page faults, despite being quite different</p>
<p>&gt; at a processor level.</p>
<p>Processor independence, I suppose. &nbsp;Generally speaking, the only commonality you get is &quot;the MMU says no&quot;.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
