<p>Back in 2000, a crazy stunt made the front page of the local newspaper, and it still holds a special place in my heart years later. We begin with <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/truk27.shtml"> <i>Man drives pickup onto friend's roof as a stunt</i></a>. The story opens with <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/photos/photo.asp?PhotoID=887"> the picture of said pick-up on the roof of a house with its proud owner</a>. That picture already tells a story. The run-down house, the pick-up on the roof, the can of beer, the frat-boy self-satifaction... And the article hasn't even begun yet.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  As Dave Anthony's pickup truck sank slowly through the roof of a one-story house yesterday morning, he popped a Spin Doctors CD into a player and reached for a can of Budweiser. </p>
<p> "It wouldn't be a good life without a challenge," he said. "If you don't break something, you aren't trying very hard." </p>
</blockquote>
<p> You don't have to wait long before you find a sentence that begins </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> It began with a few beers... </p>
</blockquote>
<p> When a sentence begins that way, the odds are slim that the second half of the sentence is going to be "... and ended without incident." </p>
<p> The article is basically every single joke about Kent rolled into 700 words. Kent is a suburb of Seattle which Seattle-ites look down upon, and the story does nothing to dispel the stereotype. You could take the article and just run it straight on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_Live!"> <i>Almost Live!</i></a> (<a href="http://www.king5.com/perl/common/video/wmPlayer.pl?title=www.king5.com/almostlive/ki_almostlive_womenmag.wmv">Here's a typical parody</a>.) </p>
<p> But the story doesn't end with that article. Less than a week later, <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/truk01.shtml"> the hero of the story found himself in even more hot water</a>. I'll let the follow-up article's opening sentence explain: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Driving your pickup truck onto the roof of a house and getting your picture in the newspaper doesn't make a whole lot of sense when police want to talk to you about a $2,800 set of tires purchased with a stolen credit card. </p>
</blockquote>

		<p>Heh. I&#8217;ve lived in Kent the last 13 years and watched it move from complete redneck-ville to yuppified suburban sprawl. I&#8217;m not certain which I prefer&#8230;</p>
<p>My favorite Kent-related Almost Live skit was definitely Green Riverdance (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.king5.com/perl/common/video/wmPlayer.pl?title=www.king5.com/almostlive/ki_almostlive_greenriverdance.wmv" rel="nofollow">http://www.king5.com/perl/common/video/wmPlayer.pl?title=www.king5.com/almostlive/ki_almostlive_greenriverdance.wmv</a>).</p>

		<p>Something else subtle but very interesting in the second article: the tires &quot;were purchased with a credit card stolen from a retired Auburn doctor [who] reported his wallet stolen from a Kent motel.&quot;</p>
<p>Seeing that Kent and Auburn are adjacent cities, what would an Auburn doctor need to be doing in a Kent motel? &nbsp;I&#8217;ve got guesses, none of which sound very clean.</p>

		<p>Hey&#8230;I grew up in Kent! &nbsp;This brings back lots of memories. :)</p>
<p>You should have seen it 10-15 years ago. &nbsp;Way more redneck than it is now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My favorite Almost Live skit about Kent was the Cops in Kent. &nbsp;The hair not teased out enough, the yuppies from Bellevue coming in and NOT going to Caveman, the missing trucker cap. &nbsp;Brilliant.</p>

		<p>Alcohol: the oil that greases the wheels of stupidity.</p>
<p>The roof! The roof! The roof is &#8230; not designed to bear the weight of a GMC truck.</p>

		<p>The pickup-idiot combination reminded me of a guy who had a row with his girlfriend, lost his temper and started smashing up her vehicle (a pickup, I think) &#8211; using a shotgun. From the fact the story was widely told, you can probably guess what happened next.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s a family in Scotland which had a long-standing feud; eventually, they resorted to *fire-bombing* the other family. Not bright, considering they lived in the apartment below, and fire tends to go upwards&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve noticed something odd about the US/UK compared to Sweden. It&#8217;s not like the average intelligence level is much different, but the standard deviation is much, much higher. So you have people who are absolutely brilliant, and people who are as dumb as this guy. Small numbers of both of course, but it doesn&#8217;t take very many ultra smart of ultra stupid people to make a difference.</p>

		<p>Not fair really. It&#8217;s his truck to wreck. He&#8217;s got permission to wreck the house. So, yes, he&#8217;s a loon, but still a harmless loon. Why should he have to pay $700 to have it towed off? If he totals it trying to drive it off, that&#8217;s his lookout, surely?</p>

<p>Remember, this is America. Somebody (parets/sibilings/children) might sue the city if he hurt himself while the police were watching. The police demonstrated they have the authority to stop this stupidity; had they not done so, they might be held liable.</p>
<p>And as Oliver pointed out, a warning will appear in the manual about driving on a roof&#8230;</p>

<p>They resorted to *fire-bombing* the other family? Where did they think they were?? Ireland???</p>

<p>The police knew he had been drinking. I think it&#8217;s more a question of, what if he totaled himself while a dozen policemen stood by and watched? They might come in for some criticism.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
