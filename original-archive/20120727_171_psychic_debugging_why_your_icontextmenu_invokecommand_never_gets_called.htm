<p>A customer reported a problem with their shell context menu extension.</p>

<p> Since there really isn't much information provided in this request, I was forced to invoke my psychic powers. Actually, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/10/07/239197.aspx"> given what you know about shell context menu hosting</a>, you probably know the answer too. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> My psychic powers tell me that you gave your menu item the wrong ID, or you returned the wrong value from <code>IContext&shy;Menu::<wbr>Query&shy;Context&shy;Menu</wbr></code>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> If the menu IDs do not lie in the range you described by the return value from <code>IContext&shy;Menu::<wbr>Query&shy;Context&shy;Menu</wbr></code>, then when the user chooses the menu item, the item ID will not map to your shell extension. In our sample composite context menu, observe that <code>CComposite&shy;Context&shy;Menu::<wbr>Reduce&shy;Ordinal</wbr></code> relies on the component context menu handlers putting their menu IDs in the range <code>idCmd&shy;First</code> through <code>idCmd&shy;First - return_<wbr>value - 1</wbr></code>. If the two don't line up, then <code>CComposite&shy;Context&shy;Menu::<wbr>Reduce&shy;Ordinal</wbr></code> won't realize that the menu item the user selected corresponds to you. </p>
<p> We never did hear back from the customer, so the world may never know whether my psychic prediction was correct. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: When possible, use a static verb registration instead of an <code>IContext&shy;Menu</code> handler. They are much simpler to implement while still providing a good amount of expressive power. </p>

<p>I think when you never hear back from a customer you can assume that your psychic predictions were correct.</p>

<p>Did you expect a response?</p>
<p>They asked a question; you answered it. If you want to hear back, I would suggest stating your answer in the form of a question.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia: &quot;Did you give your menu item the right ID, and are you returning the right value from IContextMenu::QueryContextMenu?&quot;</p>

		<p>@jader3rd: the probability of using the over-complicated solution, ironically, is even greater if you do your homework and google the answer: there are many blogs and programming sites that explain the complicated (and, to be fair, more general) way of solving a problem, instead of the simple one that works most of the time and requires half the code. It&#39;s the same as recommending Nero burning ROM, with its ten-page disk burning wizard capable of mixed CD-DA/CD-ROM disks and other authoring extravagances, to a friend who only needs to backup his Documents folder.</p>

<p>Yes. I originally thought that its missing was due to an artifact of such messages not being relayed back to the engineers. Now I know better.</p>

<p>Chances are the customer liaison was just as in the dark about the accuracy of your psychic predictions as you were. They probably never heard back from the customer either.</p>

<p>According to your own advice you would not recommend Windows either as OS since 70% of it&#39;s capabilities are not used by more then 50% of the population. Heck, you would recommend DOS for that matter.</p>

		<p>I originally parsed the sentence beginning &quot;If the menu IDs do not lie..&quot; as &#39;If the menu IDs do not tell a false hood..&#39;, rather than &#39;If the menu IDs do not exist in the range..&#39; which of course give the sentence almost exactly the opposite meaning. I find these sort of ambiguities in natural language fascinating.</p>

		<p>For me &quot;Psychic debugging&quot; is to notice, and remember, strange behavior. And later put that knowledge to use. Naive and sloppy people are often stunned by how you could know stuff, which they could have learned themselves if they were less ignorant.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Double meaning of the word &#39;lie&#39; also happens in other languages. In Russian, these words are related. In German, these are also pretty close.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
