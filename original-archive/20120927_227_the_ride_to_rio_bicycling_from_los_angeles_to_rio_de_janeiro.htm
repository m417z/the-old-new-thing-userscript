		<p>Am I the only one thinking: &nbsp;If I were going to bike to Rio, I don&#39;t think I would do it on a used bike purchased from (what appears to be) a stranger.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s actually not possible to travel by land all the way. &nbsp;There are no roads in the Darien Gap, between Panama and Colombia.</p>

		<p>And yet, the only thing I&#39;ll remember from the video is the use of &quot;it&#39; s hidden wonders&quot; instead of &quot;its hidden wonders&quot;&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, not exactly true but it always makes my brain pause for a second when I see this kind of mistakes.</p>
<p>More on topic, a friend&#39; s father did travel around the globe with his bike. It seems that he at least did it twice:</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.unautretour.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.unautretour.com/</a> (38121 km on bike)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#39; t know how people find the energy to do things like that&#8230;</p>

		<p>Having once crossed the Darien Gap on foot, I can&#39;t imagine trying to huff a bike and a bunch of gear through it. &nbsp;The trails are often very narrow in places and occasionally involve climbing some rather large rocks.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the first all-wheeled crossing of the Darien Gap was 40 years ago on a road bike.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t imagine they&#39;ll make very good time, though. They&#39;re expecting to cover an average of 55mi per day, but on that kind of terrain I think they&#39;ll be lucky to hit 10% of that.</p>
<p>At least Colombia is safe again so they won&#39;t need an armed escort!</p>

		<p>@David: You could probably get through the Darien Gap without *too* much trouble on a mountain bike, but considering the terrain and dangers involved, I sure as heck would hire a ferry to boat me around. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing.</p>
<p>If they attempt it, this project is suddenly a *lot* more impressive. Crossing the Darien Gap safely overland would be, IMO, more impressive than the rest of the bike trip combined.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
