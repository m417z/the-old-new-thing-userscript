<p> The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/dcole/default.mspx"> Senior Vice President of MSN</a> happens also to have been the  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/24/455557.aspx"> development manager of Windows&nbsp;95</a>, so he made the generous gesture of inviting the members of the Windows&nbsp;95 team to his group's birthday party. (Since the remaining members of the Windows&nbsp;95 team are outnumbered forty-to-one by the current members of the MSN team, it gave the impression that Windows&nbsp;95 was merely an after-thought to MSN! "Ten years ago, MSN&nbsp;1.0 went live! And if I recall correctly, some little operating system rode our coattails.") </p>

		<p>Do you mean the current members of the Windows 95 team, or the MS employees who are still around who worked on Windows 95?</p>
<p>I know Windows 95 is well past its end of life, but I wonder if there are still people who work on these old OSes in any capacity?</p>

		<p>Dodgeball is really fun. There&#8217;s an adult dodgeball tournament near Boston that I&#8217;ve wanted to play in but can&#8217;t due to school. However, at my school (Rochester Institute of Technology), one of the frats holds an annual dodgeball tournament. Practically the entire campus shows up and it goes on the whole day. All proceeds (which ends up being quite a lot of money) are donated to a charity.</p>

		<p>Did MSN launch back in 95/96?  I had no idea it was that old.</p>

		<p>I was at this party, and the dodgeball tourney was clearly the central draw.</p>
<p>I was shocked (shocked!) at the number of black &quot;windows 95 product team&quot; t-shirts I saw.</p>

		<p>Originally MSN was meant to be a closed service provider, like old AOL before it went internet.</p>
<p>It happened at the same time as the w95 launch, as the new OS was used to launch the program that ran the new msn. Eventually MSN gave up being an old-fashioned provider and became and ordinary ISP.</p>

		<p>At Amazon, Jeff Bezos is a huge dodgeball fan, so he had a dedicated dodgeball court put into the parking lot.  If I recall correctly, the day it opened, someone broke an ankle.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
