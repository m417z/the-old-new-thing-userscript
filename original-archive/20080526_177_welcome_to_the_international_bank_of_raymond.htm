<p>Over a decade ago, one of my colleagues (whom I'll call "Ralph" for the purpose of this discussion) told me that he briefly ran an international bank.</p>
<p> Well, not really. </p>
<p> Ralph's first roommate was another Microsoft employee, somewhat of the stereotypical computer nerd in the sense that he could write code like a maniac but didn't have a good grasp on mundane life skills like, say, cashing paychecks (this was the days before direct deposit), paying bills, or opening glass doors before walking through. Ralph helped out his roommate by managing his finances for him, depositing his roommate's paychecks, paying his bills, loaning him cash (which he didn't have since he forgot to cash his paychecks). Opening doors, on the other hand, was still his own problem. </p>
<p> In exchange for this high level of personal finance management, Ralph charged a "generous" service fee, calling himself <i>The International Bank of Ralph</i> or <i>IBOR</i>. (Pronounced <i>eye-bore</i>.) </p>
<p> This is all a rather lengthy lead-in to the story of the International Bank of Raymond, which rather confusingly also goes by the name IBOR. But the International Bank of Raymond is a much more customer-oriented bank than the International Bank of Ralph. For example, a friend of mine wanted to buy a <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/suburban/"> Suburban</a>, and after negotiating with his wife, they arrived at the following agreement: He could get a Suburban, but only if it were yellow and cost no more than $5000. His wife figured these restrictions would delay the acquisition of the Suburban for a long time, possibly indefinitely. What she didn't count on, however, was that within a week, my friend would see a yellow Suburban with a For Sale sign in the parking lot of a local grocery store, with an asking price of... $5000! The owner asked to be paid in cash, and my friend didn't have that much money readily available, so he turned to the International Bank of Raymond. He borrowed $5000 from me to buy the Suburban (mind you, I don't keep that much cash on hand either, but I did have it readily available in a bank account), and then a week later, he repaid the loan. </p>
<p> Turnabout is fair play. My friend's wife wanted to take him on a surprise trip. Had she bought the airplane tickets herself, she would have risked her husband noticing it on her bank statement. To avoid this problem, she established a line of credit at the International Bank of Raymond: I bought the tickets for her, and she repaid me after they returned from their vacation. </p>
<p> How does one establish an account at the International Bank of Raymond? Well, first, you have to be a good personal friend of Raymond for several years... </p>

		<p>I&#8217;m wondering where the &quot;International&quot; part comes from. &nbsp;No mention of currency trading or such. &nbsp;Also, doesn&#8217;t sound like you take deposits. &nbsp;But basically, you sound more like a payday lender, or a loan shark. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Hehe, seems we&#8217;re in the same business, Raymond :-) Just a few days ago a good friend called to ask me if I could keep a pretty sum on hand (about half a monthly salary) in case he needed it, and he knew the answer would be positive even before he asked :-)</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230;called to ask me if I could keep a pretty sum on hand (about half a monthly salary) in case he needed it&quot;</p>
<p>Half a month&#8217;s salary is &quot;a pretty sum&quot;? &nbsp;I keep almost a month&#8217;s pay immediately available as a comfortable minimum monthly bank account balance, and even more in a savings account labelled &quot;emergency fund&quot; for if I need it.</p>

		<p>I think he meant &quot;a pretty sum&quot; in the context of a loan. &nbsp;I also keep about a month&#8217;s pay immediately accessible, but if somebody came to me and said &quot;hey, can you set aside half a month&#8217;s pay for a loan to me?&quot; I would view that as a sizable chunk of money to set aside for a loan. &nbsp;$20 is one thing, $1000+ is something else.</p>

		<p>Much better to run Dave&#8217;s Really Cheap Cars, we can make a yellow Suburban appear in your local parking lot with a $5K price tag just before your wife turns up there. &nbsp;We charge a small commission on sales (equal to the difference between the cost of a Suburban + 10% and $5K), payable in cash at the time of delivery.</p>

		<p>dave: I read somewhere that everyone is supposed to keep 6 months&#8217; salary on hand in a savings account or emergency fund in case of job loss, disability, etc.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as easy as it sounds for everyone to actually do this. &nbsp;People starting out in the workforce after college often have other priorities (spouses, children, a car, a house) and after that, it takes an extreme amount of discipline and a VERY long time to get this much money saved up.</p>
<p>It would be nice, though&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
