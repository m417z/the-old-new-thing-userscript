		<p>the more icky part is that someone can be a vice president of a company and happily state (allegedly) that he &quot;did not like women&quot; and call women who&#8217;s jobs he&#8217;d (allegedly) threatened &quot;[expletive] terrorists&quot;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>dealing with customers who comment on your underwear? &nbsp;That&#8217;s a standard female skill in the patriarchy &#8211; most girls have mastered that one by the age of 10 yrs.</p>

		<p>My company had mandatory compliance training because of some lawsuit and while most of the sessions were on business transactions, one of them was on employee conduct. &nbsp;So in the training there was a question that was something like &quot;Ann wears tight and low-cut clothing to work with a thong and one day Mark says &#8216;Hey, that&#8217;s a sexy thong you have on&#8217;. &nbsp;Ann felt uncomfortable at Mark&#8217;s comment.&quot; &nbsp;The question to us employees was obviously to decide whether Mark&#8217;s comment was inappropriate for the workplace.</p>
<p>Turns out it was not inappropriate. &nbsp;It was apparently her fault for dressing sexy. &nbsp;Who knew?</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m assuming that the compliance training approached the question from a legal standpoint, and there&#8217;s probably legal precedent saying that his comment wasn&#8217;t inappropriate, but I don&#8217;t know for sure)</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Mark says &quot;Hey, that&#8217;s a sexy thong you have on&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course it was not inappropriate &#8212; he was addressing thong rather then her. On the other hand, if he said &quot;Hey, you look sexy in that thong&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>I liked this quote from the article:</p>
<p>&quot;Even the fries are listed on the menu as &quot;skinny.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>I never heard of anybody getting offended by thin-cut fries before&#8230; We call them &quot;shoe-string chips&quot; in Australia, parhaps in an attempt to be politically correct?</p>

<p>Ann knows very well that exposing her underwear to the world is an act of &quot;trolling&quot;. &nbsp;Anyone who fishes understands that you will make a lot of casts before you catch something that you want in your boat. &nbsp;There&#8217;s really no sense being mad *at the fish* if your lure caught its attention and reacts. &nbsp;Either don&#8217;t troll, or don&#8217;t whine about what you catch while trolling; you can&#8217;t have it both ways.</p>

		<p>Last year there was a discussion in the MFC newsgroup about an odd observation that suddenly better results were coming from using MSDN to search MSDN than from using Google to search MSDN. &nbsp;One of the subthreads tangented off into other search subjects, someone observed that the most common search was for panties, and someone else said that panties are on-topic.</p>
<p>How boring.</p>
<p>Well, now this adult-rated blog[*] solves the issue. &nbsp;Panties are off-limits.</p>
<p>Off is better than on, indeed.</p>
<p>Nitpicker&#8217;s corner:</p>
<p>* Yes this is a footnote marker. &nbsp;No I&#8217;m too lazy to search for the article in this blog that observed that some judgement site had assigned this blog an adult rating.</p>

		<p>Being too sexy in the workplace is distracting. But I don&#8217;t think anyone has ever actually said anything to me about it.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
