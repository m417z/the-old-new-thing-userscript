<p>Today is a holiday in the United States, so I'm going to celebrate by referring you to other things to read.</p>
<p> I'm going to start with a presentation by Bruce Dawson at GDC 2009, which is basically multiple instances of the question "Is this code correct?", and the answer is always "No!" Although the title of the talk is <i>Lockless Programming in Games</i>, the information is relevant to pretty much everybody. I can't find a recording of the presentation, but you can <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1751/Lockless-Programming-in"> download the PowerPoint slides</a> or <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=http://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/gdc09/slides/GDC09_Dawson_Lockless_Programming.ppt"> view them in your browser</a>. But I recommend downloading the PowerPoint slides and reading the notes, because the notes explain the slides. [Update: Ah, you can see the notes in the browser by clicking the Notes button at the bottom. So download whichever you prefer. Just make sure you read the notes.] </p>
<p> A more game-focused presentation by Bruce Dawson has the more general title <i>Coding for Multiple Cores</i>. <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/e/5bec52bd-8f96-4137-a2ab-df6c7a2580b9/Coding_for_Multiple_Cores.ppt"> Download the PowerPoint sides</a> or <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/e/5bec52bd-8f96-4137-a2ab-df6c7a2580b9/Coding_for_Multiple_Cores.ppt"> view them in your browser</a>. </p>
<p> Then there is the MSDN white paper that he authored, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee418650(v=vs.85).aspx"> <i>Lockless Programming Considerations for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows</i></a>. </p>
<p> Finally, there's Herb Sutter's two-part talk <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Cpp-and-Beyond-2012-Herb-Sutter-atomic-Weapons-1-of-2"> atomic&lt;&gt; Weapons, part 1</a> and <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Cpp-and-Beyond-2012-Herb-Sutter-atomic-Weapons-2-of-2"> part 2</a>. </p>
<p> That should keep you busy for a while. </p>

		<p>I&#39;m being blocked by my works firewall from downloading the first PPT &#8211; which you advise because it has the notes. Are those notes more comprehensive than the ones you obtain by using the second link and clicking &quot;notes&quot; in the bottom status bar (most of the way towards the right hand side)?</p>

		<p>@Damien I&#39;ve just downloaded the presentation from the first link and, at least for the initial slides, the notes are the same as those presented in the second link.</p>

		<p>There&#39;s a cool patent by NetApp (US8578386) that describes lockless programming using so-called &quot;domains&quot; to distribute the workload. It&#39;s a simple yet effective way of doing lockless programming. Too bad it&#39;s patented</p>

		<p>I like Cliff Click&#39;s technique of modelling lock free algorithms as a state machine which makes reasoning and proofs significantly easier (but still difficult). Here is a presentation of him describing a lock free hash table:</p>

		<p>Is it possible to read the notes if you have only Powerpoint Viewer, as opposed to the full thing?</p>

		<p>Author here. Thanks for the shout out for those talks. I enjoyed creating them. At the time there was the genuine complexity of lock-free programming, combined with the (significant) accidental complexity created by the lack of portable support for lock-free programming, together with some messy decisions made in the Xbox 360 software.</p>
<p>But, things have improved. For more up-to-date discussions of lock-free strategies, including the C++ 11 constructs that support it, I strongly recommend visiting this site:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://preshing.com/">http://preshing.com/</a></p>
<p>If you use C++ 11 atomics then you only have the genuine complexity of lock-free programming. This is still significant enough that most people should never write lock-free code.</p>

		<p>@Darkstar: I think what is described in the first point of that patent is the same as basic concept of functional programming&#8230; why would such a patent be granted?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
