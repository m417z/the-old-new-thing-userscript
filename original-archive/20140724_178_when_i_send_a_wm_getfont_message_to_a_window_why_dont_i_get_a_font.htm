<p>A customer reported that the <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;FONT</wbr></code> message was not working. Specifically, they sent the message to a window, and they can plainly see that the window is rendering with a particular font, yet the <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;FONT</wbr></code> message returns 0. Why isn't the window returning the correct font handle?</p>
<p> The <code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;FONT</wbr></code> and <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;FONT</wbr></code> messages are not mandatory. A window may choose to support them, or it may choose not to, or it may even choose to support one but not the other. (Though if it supports <code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;FONT</wbr></code>, it probably ought to support <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;FONT</wbr></code>.) </p>
<p> For example, our <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/25/54582.aspx"> scroll bar program</a> creates a custom font for the items in the list, but it does not implement the <code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;FONT</wbr></code> or <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;FONT</wbr></code> messages. If you try to change the font via <code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;FONT</wbr></code>, nothing happens. If you ask for the font via <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;FONT</wbr></code>, you get nothing back. </p>
<p> A control might ignore your attempt to change the font if it already has its own notion of what font it should be using. Or maybe the control shows content in multiple fonts, so the concept of "the" font does not map well to the render model. (What would <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;FONT</wbr></code> on an HTML control return?) Or maybe the control doesn't use GDI fonts at all. (Maybe it uses Direct&shy;Write.) </p>
<p> That's one of the reasons why <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/09/12/8945692.aspx"> the rules for the <code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;FONT</wbr></code></a> are set up the way they are. Since there is no way to tell whether a window did anything in response to the <code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;FONT</wbr></code> message, there would be no way to know whether responsibility for destroying the font should be transferred to the control or retained by the caller. </p>
<p> Controls that are designed to be used in dialog boxes are the ones most likely to support the <code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;FONT</wbr></code> message, since that's the message the dialog manager uses to tell each control the font specified in the dialog box template. The hope is that all of the controls will respect that font, so that the controls on the dialog box have a consistent appearance. But there's nothing preventing a control from saying, "Screw you. I'm drawing with OCR-A and there's nothing you can do to stop me." </p>

		<p>There are good reasons why some controls don&#39;t respect WM_SETFONT. &nbsp;I have seen controls that used the Wingdings font in order to embellish the appearance of the control. &nbsp;Those controls SHOULD ignore WM_GET/SETFONT. &nbsp;With respect to these two messages, I think they are designed exactly the way they should be.</p>

		<p>@12BitSlab: I&#39;m partially disagree with you. While it make sense for the WM_SETFONT part, if the control supports WM_COPY, maybe it&#39;d be good to support some way that allow the copying application know you&#39;re using Wingdings.</p>

		<p>@cheong00: In that case, the control should be using codepoints from the Unicode blocks &quot;Dingbats&quot;[0] and &quot;Ornamental Dingbats&quot;[1] to display the characters, rather than overloading existing characters. It&#39;s not the &#39;90s any more!</p>

		<p>Raymond, Unicode has specific blocks just for non-standard characters. According to Wikipedia the Windows flag is often mapped to U+F000. And you&#39;d be surprised at what makes it into Unicode &#8211; the latest update includes the Vulcan &quot;live long and prosper&quot; sign.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>The flip side is that if a button intends to show the Windows logo, and then it gets put inside a dialog box, and the dialog box does a <code>WM_SETFONT</code> to tell the control to get with the font program, your Windows logo is now showing up in the wrong font (and will probably be an ugly black box). This can get particularly nasty if the control is, say, a scroll bar. The up/down arrows are now ugly black boxes. (I don&#39;t even want to think what happens if the control is a Web browser.) -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@Timothy Byrd (ETAP) I would force all controls to take care of WM_GET/SETFONT. In fact I would force all controls to subclass a basic class that would take care of it. Why? Consistence. UI is a very serious feature. Users like to have a consistent experience. Non technical users expend a lot of time to learn the shell to be screwed up. So if you don&#39;t override those messages you&#39;d get the standard shell font that the user like the most. So I&#39;d make users and others developers happy.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>How do you force a control to use the font passed to WM_SETFONT? Do you fail all attempts to call SelectObject on the paint DC with some other font? (GDI would say &quot;Hey, don&#39;t drag me into your little argument. I just render with whatever font you tell me.&quot;) That wouldn&#39;t stop programs that use double-buffering. It would also make all Word documents look pretty boring. (&quot;Sorry, you can&#39;t change your document font. You have to use the system font.&quot;) -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>[It would also make all Word documents look pretty boring.]</p>

		<p>[How do you force a control to use the font passed to WM_SETFONT?]</p>
<p>You may not be able to force a control to support WM_SETFONT, but having DefWindowProc support WM_GETFONT might be possible. &nbsp;The problem with messages like WM_GETFONT, WM_PRINTWINDOW and WM_COPY being the responsibility of the window is that many developers don&#39;t know that or don&#39;t want to put in the effort to support them.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I guess DefWindowProc could implement it by stashing the font handle and regurgitating it in WM_GETFONT, and the control is expected to send itself a WM_GETFONT to find out what font to use. But you&#39;re still requiring the control to do something special, so all you did was change &quot;respond to WM_GETFONT and WM_SETFONT&quot; to &quot;send WM_GETFONT when painting&quot;. (And how can DefWindowProc implement WM_COPY automatically?) -Raymond</em>]</div>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
