		<p>To this former English major turned software geek, it sounds very much like the conventional 17th-19th century usage of this word, e.g. &quot;I have an engagement that evening&quot; or &quot;We have a business engagement&quot;. It&#8217;s not especially jargony, but perhaps a bit archaic, which probably makes it sound more obnoxious to the engineer&#8217;s ear.</p>
<p>An engagement usually refers to an appointment or promise. Sometimes it&#8217;s a contractual obligation.</p>

		<p>On a related note, how does a question &quot;surround&quot; a feature? &nbsp;&quot;Surround&quot; isn&#8217;t a synonym for &quot;pertaining to&quot; or &quot;about&quot;.</p>

		<p>To add to what Jason has said &#8212; You will not find anything surprising about the use of &quot;engagement&quot; to mean &quot;appointment&quot; if you&#8217;ve ever read the Hansard transcript of Prime Minister&#8217;s Questions. &nbsp;The first question to the prime minister is usually the formulaic: &quot;If he will list his official engagements for [today&#8217;s date].&quot;</p>
<p>The Microspeak probably derived from the language used by management consultants (McKinsey, Bain, et al.) &nbsp;For example: &quot;So did you transfer to our Abu Dhabi office permanently, or are you just there for a client engagement?&quot;</p>
<p>The management consultants, however, use the term less to mean &quot;appointment&quot; and more to mean &quot;contractual obligation.&quot; &nbsp; The entire duration of the project forms a single engagement, even if you rack up a quarter-million frequent flyer miles going back-and-forth to the client&#8217;s site.</p>

		<p>To a geek and major Whedon fanboy like myself&#8230; &quot;In their resting state, our actives are as innocent and vulnerable as children. We call it the &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;. The blank slate. Now imagine the imprint process filling it, creating a new personality. A friend, a lover, a confidant in a sea of enemies. Your heart&#8217;s desire made flesh. And when the engagement has been completed, all memory of you and your time together will be wiped clean.&quot;</p>
<p>Be truthful here &#8211; is Microsoft working on Active technology?</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I understand you point (&quot;I have a prior engagement&quot; is still in common usage), but don&#8217;t think these examples are in the same category as the one Raymond gave. These examples use engagement fairly generically; it could be a work dinner, a grand opening etc. Raymond&#8217;s example of &quot;a customer engagement&quot; sounds to me like it could only mean a meeting. So why not use the word meeting instead? It would have been much clearer. The answer is the person who used it chose to sound pompous and self-important instead of being clear. Sounds like micro-speak to me.</p>
<p>By the way, how can you be a former English major? Did your degree expire?</p>

		<p>Anti-snark: &nbsp;Out here in the consulting world, we call it an &quot;engagement&quot; when the customer is paying us to be there. &nbsp;The customer &quot;engages&quot; Microsoft Consulting Services, so I think it&#8217;s completely legitimate. &nbsp;Raymond, was the writer in MCS?</p>

		<p>Seems reasonable. Feature X is probably one of the customer&#8217;s top asks, so he wants to take the issue offline, and action the efforting moving forward.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
