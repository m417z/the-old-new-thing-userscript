		<p>One of our embedded DSP developers brought us back a board once and said &quot;It just quit working&quot;. Further observation revealed coffee stains around a bunch of the ICs.</p>
<p>So maybe that toddler will become a SW developer some day&#8230;.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s more accurate to say that &quot;water&quot; was a counter to the fake question &quot;how did the floor get wet?&quot;. Your question really meant &quot;a kid spilling water on the floor is a culturally approved event that I can punish in response to. Saying the name of the kid initiates the punishment sequence. Say the name of the kid.&quot;</p>
<p>Her response with &quot;water&quot; really meant &quot;I see through your fake question and I&#39;m blocking the punishment sequence from continuing.&quot;</p>

		<p>well, near a three-year-old it could be some other liquid, too. So in this case &quot;water&quot; is shorthand for &quot;I spilled some water, no need to change clothes&quot;. Some kids don&#39;t like to talk too much, and I know grown-ups that would have just grunted and shown you a glass of water.</p>

		<p>&gt; And I have no doubt that she will be a lawyer to fear.</p>
<p>Indeed, most small children are naturally lawyers.</p>
<p>I remember my pre-verbal almost-two year old, hauled up to his room during some power struggle, plonked in his room, and told by me &quot;do not take one step out of this room!&quot;</p>
<p>Standing in the doorway, but *just* inside it, he looked me square in the eye, and banged his *hand* down in the hallway outside his room.</p>
<p>I was agog for a second or two, and then I had to flee before I laughed out loud at the idea that I&#39;d just been bested by a two-year old. &nbsp;(If I&#39;d laughed in his presence when he was in royal ire, he&#39;d been ticked for hours. &nbsp;Like most small children, he had a keen sense of dignity.)</p>

		<p>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m with Engywuck on this one. Once I saw a puddle on the floor and asked my three-year-old what it was, she said &quot;water&quot;. Seeing no obvious source (e.g. spilled cup), I asked where it came from.</p>
<p>She answered, in her adorable 3-year-old syntax, &quot;It leak out of mine butt.&quot;</p>

		<p>My kid did a similar one:</p>
<p>Wife: &quot;No jumping on the couch.&quot;</p>
<p>5 year old: HMMMM&#8230;.</p>
<p>So she takes the cushions off the couch and puts them on the floor and jumps on them there.</p>
<p>At that point, we let her win &#8211; it was no longer unsafe, and she found a loophole.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
