<p> One of the consequences of studying another language for me is that I develop some sort of mental connection with the people who speak that language, despite having no innate cultural basis for it. When I studied German, I found myself cheering for the German athletes in the Olympic Games. And in the men's 4x10,000 cross-country relay yesterday, I was cheering for the German team, the Swedish team, and the Norwegian team (especially the Norwegians), but it was all for naught as <a href="http://www.torino2006.org/ENG/IDF/CC/C73C_CCM410101.html"> the Italians proved too much for all of them</a>. </p>
<p> (Yes, I haven't started studying Norwegian yet, but, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/12/130455.aspx"> as my Swedish readers already know</a>, it was the Lillehammer Olympics that reinforced my interest in the Scandinavian languages, and with it, my affinity for the Norwegian cross-country team.) </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard of the state Kerala (it&#8217;s in India). The people of Kerala (where I come from) speak a language called Malayalam. It&#8217;s the only language as far as I know, that has a palindrome for its spelling in English :-)</p>

		<p>The language seems to use it&#8217;s own set of fonts as well:</p>
<p>ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ dpkg &#8211;get-selections|grep malaya<br />
<br />ttf-malayalam-fonts &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; install<br /></p>

		<p>This is slightly off-topic, but what is your (Raymond&#8217;s/anyone&#8217;s) preferred method of studying a new language? My wife and I are considering learning Italian somewhat casually without a large monetary investment and I&#8217;m not sure about what might be the best route.</p>

		<p>See &#8211; now I have started learning Italian, so cheering for the winners just felt natural to me. &nbsp;Maybe you&#8217;ll just have to stop learning loser languages!!</p>

		<p>I like Esperanto. Well, you can&#8217;t cheer for the Esperanto team, since it is meant to be an international language, but it&#8217;s OK. :-)<br />
<br />It&#8217;s an interesting language because you can focus on the structure, expressiveness, word composition, etc. and you don&#8217;t need to worry about irregularities.<br />
<br />I think everyone who likes languages should give it a try. Either for the langugage or for the ideal.</p>

		<p>Norway can afford to lose some medals, seeing as they&#8217;ve won the most medals in total during the olympics.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://odin.dep.no/odin/engelsk/norway/history/032005-990497/index-dok000-b-n-a.html" rel="nofollow">http://odin.dep.no/odin/engelsk/norway/history/032005-990497/index-dok000-b-n-a.html</a></p>
<p>Norwegians have to learn two written languages..<br /></p>

		<p>Not only do we have to learn two languages, The national tv-channel has to have a percentage of its programmes written in the second language, and thousands of schoolchildren get their grades messed up because they just dont see why they should learn two different, but similiar languages.</p>
<p>By the way, we all learn english the first 7 years of school, German or French the next 3 after that, and then maybe Spanish or more german if we go to college.</p>
<p>And although we won the most medals in the Olympics, we are not really happy, since they are mostly silver and bronze :D</p>

		<p>Kan bara h&#229;lla med om att det var en mycket sp&#228;nnande stafett. </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
