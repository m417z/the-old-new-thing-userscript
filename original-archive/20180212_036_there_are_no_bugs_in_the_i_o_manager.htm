<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zbikowski">
Mark Zbikowski</a>
told me a story from the early Windows NT days.
</p>
<p>He found a race condition in the file system
code and went to see the lead developer for the I/O subsystem.
</p>
<p>
"There are no bugs in the I/O Manager," the developer proclaimed.
</p>
<p>
Mark walked through the scenario to demonstrate
the problem.
</p>
<p>
The lead developer
went to his editor and typed furiously for two or three minutes,
ending with a theatrical punch of the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.
</p>
<p>
And he turned to Mark and proclaimed,
"There are no bugs in the I/O Manager."</p>

		<p>I think that was the two or three minutes of typing. i.e. he fixed the bug, so his statement was &#8220;technically&#8221; correct</p>

		<p>Or there are cases why you add a few checks to verbosely display the execution state (possibly these are the days before the concept of unit tests exists), run the code and see the internal state matches his expectation, and confirmed that there&#8217;s indeed no bug.</p>
<p>This could also be fitted in the 2-3 minutes time frame.</p>

		<p>In fact, when he proclaimed &#8220;There are no bugs in the I/O Manager&#8221;, he was confirming that the one and only existing bug had been squashed. If only half the developers took as seriously bug fixing as this one, six billion people would live better&#8230;</p>

		<p>Is the race condition his initial proclamation that there are no bugs in the I/O manager? Bugs being fixed before their reporting suggests a race condition of some sort &#8211; possibly in the space-time component of the universe.</p>

		<p>Over the years I have come to the conclusion that this is a hard to bridge philosophical issue, &#8216;does a piece of software have the property of bugginess independent of the existence of known bugs?&#8217;. To me, the answer is clearly yes, but I have worked with a couple of people at various points who clearly have the attitude that program X has N unfixed bugs in the bug tracking system whereas program Y has M with N&gt;M, therefore X is buggier, notwithstanding that Y has had 10 times more fixed. If M = 0 then Y is &#8216;bug free&#8217;.<br />
Questioning / arguing made me sure that they were both perfectly sincere in this belief.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone would dispute that any piece of software might have as yet unknown bugs. But there&#8217;s not much you can do with that from a practical perspective. All that&#8217;s actionable are the bugs you know about, so it&#8217;s reasonable to consider a program bug-free if it has no known bugs.</p>
<p>Besides, it is *possible* that the program really is bug-free. There&#8217;s no evidence against it (or that would be a known bug), so it&#8217;s only Bayesian statistics that makes you believe there probably is a bug there.</p>
<p>Back to the article though &#8211; it&#8217;s a nice story, but I hope at least 30 seconds of that typing was some sort of test&#8230;</p>

		<p>Unknown bugs are quite actionable. You run all kinds of antivirus and firewall software to mitigate yet undiscovered bugs. You wrap the app in a sandbox. You establish monitors and watchdogs.</p>

		<p>A traditional method of finding race conditions in operating system code is to go to the top of some function and start typing a comment: </p>
<p>/* This can&#8217;t race because</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
