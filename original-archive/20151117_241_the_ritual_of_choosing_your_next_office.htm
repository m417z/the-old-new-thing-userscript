<p>
The joke at Microsoft is
"Don't like your office?
Don't worry.
You'll be moved to a different one soon."
It's not actually that bad, at least not in my experience,
but the joke still stands.</p>
<p>
When a team moves to a new building,
there is the question of who gets which office.
And this is one of the few things at Microsoft that
is done purely by seniority:
The best offices go to people who have been at Microsoft
the longest.&sup1;
</p>
<p>
Different teams manage things differently.
The most free-for-all method is simply to give everybody
a time slot,
and at the appointed time, you come in,
look at the available offices,
and pick yours.
Subject to constraints like,
"All the people who work on the X component should
be in this area of the building."
</p>
<p>
More commonly, the manager of the team that is moving
sits down and decides
where everybody will get moved to,
taking seniority into account,
so that more senior people tend to get better offices.
</p>
<p>
I heard of
<a href="http://news.microsoft.com/stories/people/laura-butler.html">
one manager</a> who augmented the
standard pattern:
After everybody was given their office assignments,
she said,
"Okay,
anybody can swap offices by mutual agreement.
You can make side deals if you want.
If you want my office, make me an offer."
</p>
<p>
I don't know whether anybody tried to swap for her office,
or what they offered to sweeten the deal.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
Of course, senior executives will pull rank and
claim the best offices for themselves,
using excuses like
"I need an office large enough to have a meeting table,"
or
"My doctor says that I have to have a nice view of Mount Rainier."
</p></p>

		<p>Back in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s, sales people for IBM were very used to being transferred to new cities. &nbsp;It became so commonplace that the inside joke was that IBM stood for &quot;I&#39;ve Been Moved.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, the field fixit engineers said that IBM stood for &quot;Incredibly Big Machine.&quot;</p>

		<p>Open plan offices are more normal for me &amp; I try to make sure that everybody has a desk they are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Normally this means the people face the door and the middle of the room, so you can&#39;t sneak up on them.</p>
<p>A lot of managers will lie to justify why the desks need to face the walls but it&#39;s only so they can monitor you.</p>

		<p>This is no longer the case in many divisions (eg C+E). The insane change to &quot;WPA&quot; (ie open offices) means seniority counts for literally nothing. And yes, I am bitter and twisted about this as a 20yr veteran at MS.</p>

		<p>@boogaloo: Ooooh yes. And from there on it&#39;s an all-win situation for the manager: &quot;Can&#39;t I switch the desk so it faces the door?&quot; &quot;Why? You have something to hide?&quot; &quot;No, but I don&#39;t like people silently sneaking up on me, it feels like I&#39;m being monitored&quot; &quot;Well, rest assured you&#39;re not being monitored, but since you have nothing to hide, why would you even care?&quot;. I most likely didn&#39;t invent that line of reasoning, but I used it, and I look back upon it with shame. It was my first managerial position. Too young and too green in the managerial aspects of the job. I&#39;ve come a long way since then. And most likely^H^H^H^H^H^H hopefully still a long way to go too :)</p>

		<p>&quot;that is done purely by seniority&quot; &#8212; in theory.</p>
<p>In practice, it turns out if you are in a small group (i.e. where the offices are not allocated by role: dev, test, PM, etc.) with a manager who cares about all the wrong things, that you may well have your office choice rejected by said manager, on the grounds that you are &quot;too far&quot; from the other devs.</p>
<p>This was 20 years ago, and was frankly a serious anomaly then. But I&#39;m sure things at Microsoft haven&#39;t gotten _better_ in the intervening years.</p>

		<p>A few years ago, the company I was at moved to a new building. &quot;My&quot; new cubicle seated four of us, though they sometimes squeezed in five. Turns out they never hooked up the power, so I moved myself into a tiny 4&#215;8 cubicle off to the side. I loved it. Ironically, at my current company we are about to move to a giant room with no cubicles; just desks on rollers.</p>

<p>Long time, increased stress level =&gt; shorter lifespan. It&#39;s undisputed.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
