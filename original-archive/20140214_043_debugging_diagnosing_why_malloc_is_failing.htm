<p>A customer had some code which was experiencing memory allocation failures when calling <code>malloc</code> (which maps to <code>Heap&shy;Alloc</code>). The function returns <code>nullptr</code>, and <code>Get&shy;Last&shy;Error()</code> reports <code>ERROR_<wbr>NOT_<wbr>ENOUGH_<wbr>MEMORY</wbr></wbr></wbr></code>. However, there was still plenty of memory free:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task Manager reported working set at around 400MB,     with a peak of 550MB. </li>
<li>Using the <code>_heap&shy;walk</code> function     to compute the total memory used resulted in about     380MB being reported. </li>
<li>The <code>_heap&shy;chk</code> function reported     no errors. </li>
<li>The virtual memory size for the process was     a little bit more than the working set size. </li>
</ul>
<p> The customer was continuing their investigation but was looking for some pointers since the bug took a day to emerge. Could it be heap fragmentation? (The program is uses the regular C runtime heap and does not enable the low-fragmentation heap.) </p>
<p> One of the suggestions was to run the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd535533.aspx"> VMMap</a> utility to see if the problem was exhaustion of virtual address space. </p>
<p> And lo and behold, that was indeed the cause. The code had a bug where it was leaking threads. Since the default stack reservation for a thread is 1MB (although typically only a tiny fraction of that ends up being committed and even less being charged against working set), a slow accumulation of threads corresponds to a slow erosion of the virtual address space until you eventually run out. </p>
<p> Once again, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/06/28/10429807.aspx"> it's the address space, stupid</a>. </p>

		<p>Yeah, we had that problem, once. </p>
<p>We were using the .Net Parallel.For() method to process a large (&gt; 4M) set of items, where the processing for each item was reasonably time consuming, such that the entire job took at least an hour. The processing was CPU bound. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Under those conditions the .Net thread pool kept adding more threads, until we had several hundred and ran out of address space and started getting OOM exceptions (actually, we usually got failures when trying to map views onto memory mapped files).</p>
<p>We used VMMap to diagnose the OOM problem, too. I was quite surprised to see &gt; 400MB under the &quot;Stack&quot; heading!</p>
<p>The simple fix was to restrict the maximum level of parallelism in the Parallel.For() call. </p>

		<p>I would assume you&#39;d get back that 1MB reservation once the thread terminates and all handles to it are closed. Is there any time that assumption would be wrong?</p>

		<p>@James: I think they fixed that basic problem with the thread pooling updates in Windows 8.1, but limiting the parallelism was probably a good idea too (perhaps to System.Environment.ProcessorCount or some derivative thereof).</p>

		<p>@James: Bad thread pool. Under no circumstances when running a CPU bound job should there be more than 2x the number of threads than schedulable cores.</p>

		<p>@Joshua,</p>
<p>That&#39;s not a bad thread pool, that&#39;s bad use of the thread pool. The thread pool doesn&#39;t know if you&#39;ll be running a CPU bound job, or if you&#39;re requesting for a thread that&#39;ll sit around most of the time, just consuming memory.</p>

		<p>So, next question would be: &quot;When a thread gets leaked?&quot;</p>
<p>1. When thread does not return</p>
<p>2. Thread returns, but its handle never closed.</p>
<p>etc.</p>

		<p>One of the things I do at work is maintain our internal VS Addins. One developer ran over and reported an out of memory error in an addin that looks at files in your TFS pending changes list. I wondered if they had an unusually large list of files checked out, but that wasn&#39;t the case. In fact, they had plenty of free memory, and the devenv.exe process didn&#39;t seem to be using that much memory (determined using Process Explorer).</p>
<p>I asked them to use VMMap and sure enough, the process&#39; memory was totally fragmented. I asked them to restart Visual Studio, and that fixed the issue. Once again, the magical reboot comes to the rescue!</p>

		<p>OK, I&#39;m missing something here. Can someone point me to a resource which explains how the leaked thread stack space can take up virtual address space without counting towards the virutal memory size of the process?</p>

		<p>Karellen: Task Manager doesn&#39;t have a stat that reports the address space consumed by a process, just the working set, private working set, and commit size (which I think used to be called VM size in XP, and probably also what Raymond is referring to in the fourth bullet), all of which will be tiny for most threads, as Raymond notes. PerfMon / Process Explorer / VMMap / other tools are needed to see the address space consumed.</p>
<p>Gabe/AsmGuru: The thread just needs to actually exit for the address space to be freed (at least, the stack, other resources associated with the thread will linger). At least, that&#39;s the observable behavior.</p>

		<p>A thread&#39;s stack has to be a contiguous chunk of virtual address space, so the thread reserves a section of virtual address space. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t commit memory (either physical or space in the page file) until it needs it.</p>
<p>According to another poster, the reservation is for 1 MB even though most threads use much less than that, and so committed memory is much smaller.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
