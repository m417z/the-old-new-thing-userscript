I received a gift card.
The instructions which accompany the gift card include the following:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
To activate, sign the back of the card.
In some cases, activation may take up to four hours.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What, you think I write that slowly?
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
Yes, I know that the reason is that
it may take up to four hours for the purchase to propagate through the
system,
and if you sign the card immediately after purchasing it,
you may still need to wait up to four hours.
That didn't apply in my case because I received the gift card
in the mail.</p>

		<p>So how does signing the back of the card transmit activation back to the server? </p>
<p>There&#8217;s some deep communication protocol going on there which I can&#8217;t get my head round. I&#8217;m impressed that the ink/plastic interface detection (which presumably then sends some data packets containing a unique card ID back to base via what? RFID? Some sort of public WiFi?) works <i>at all</i>, let alone within four hours. </p>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>

		<p>Clearly it&#8217;s using some kind of piezoelectric effect to generate electrical power from the signing action itself. From there you&#8217;d want to use some kind of low power/wide area transmission technology (just because of your low energy budget).</p>
<p>What I can&#8217;t work out is how it knows you&#8217;re done signing. Not everyone uses signatures composed of a single connected sequence of strokes. So maybe the four hours is a &#8220;worst possible case&#8221; &#8211; if they haven&#8217;t added any further strokes to the signature area for four hours, we consider the signature to be complete.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s the worst case based on people being at remote locations and their only pen running out of ink? Of course, the ink isn&#8217;t required for the electronic part of this process but if we also want ink-based signature verification to work, we want the inking process to be complete before we activate the card.</p>
<p>Some people have alleged in the past that sometimes I over-think things.</p>

		<p>activate and activation are two different things, someone should be them a thesaurus.</p>

		<p>Also, &#8220;activate&#8221; is a transitive verb, and needs a direct object. Whoever wrote that text left out the object. I could be activating anything by signing the card!</p>

		<p>A more relevant question for a software based blog is why it takes four hours to activate.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
