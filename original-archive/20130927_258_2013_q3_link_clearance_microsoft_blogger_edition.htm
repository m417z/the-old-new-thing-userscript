		<p>One other case for undocumented registry keys: removed in a service pack. The key that disabled the blur effect in aero glass was removed in W7 sp1. That was the end of aero for me due to sensitivity to blur.</p>

		<p>My guess is that &quot;set this pointless registry key&quot; was one tech support team&#39;s eqivalent of prescribing sugar pills. The client gets the &quot;magic recipe from on high&quot;, and suddenly, as with the &quot;turbo button&quot; on some later 486/Pentium systems that weren&#39;t actually connected to anything, their system &quot;feels&quot; more responsive. Everyone&#39;s happy.</p>

		<p>Random Linux fact: Under the GNOME desktop environment, grepping the equivalent of the registry is actually the standard way of doing advanced configuration&#8230;</p>

<p>HA. We told them that just as an alternative to &quot;Check and see if the ethernet cable is connected.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Anon. in Brian_EE&#39;s case, it&#39;s most likely that they were not standard cables and the wiring was not symmetric.</p>

		<p>@Karellan</p>
<p>Sadly, much like &#39;Swap the ends of the ethernet cable,&quot; a lot of Tech Support &#39;fixes&#39; are just ways to get the customer to actually check what you tell them to.</p>
<p>Ask someone &quot;Is X set to Y?&quot; and most of them will say &quot;Yes&quot; without bothering to actually *look* at X. Ask someone to change Z to A, then check if X is set to Y, and they&#39;ll *actually* look at X.</p>

		<p>@Anon,</p>
<p>Swapping the ends of the ethernet cable sometimes *IS* an actual solution. When I was in college (early 90&#39;s) the wall jacks were wired one way, and the Cat-5 to coax converter boxes for the DECnet cards in the PCs were wired another way.</p>
<p>The help desk had many calls of non-functioning PCs when students rearranged their dorm rooms. The fix &#8211; swap the cord ends.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
