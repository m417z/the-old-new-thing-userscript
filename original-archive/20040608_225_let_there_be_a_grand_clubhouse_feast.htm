<p>Kenny Mayne is one of the regular anchors for  ESPN SportsCenter  and for some reason I find this particular home run call hilarious:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  I am king of the diamond!  <a href="http://www.sportscenteraltar.com/multimedia/king.wav">  Let there be a grand clubhouse feast</a>! [WAV]  Bring me the finest meats and cheeses throughout the land!  <br>  &mdash; From <a href="http://www.sportscenteraltar.com/multimedia/">The  SportsCenter Altar multimedia download center</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>  Here's  <a href="http://www.npr.org/ramfiles/waitwait/20020511.waitwait.04.ram">  a whimisical interview where he explains where he got that from</a>  [RealAudio].  </p>
<p>  Another one I like for its understatedness:  </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <a href="http://www.sportscenteraltar.com/phrases/usage.asp?ID=408">  &lt;Football player&gt; has decided to tackle people on behalf of  the &lt;NFL team&gt;</a>.  Terms of the contract are not disclosed,  but we believe it has something to do with money.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>  Actually, I enjoyed just reading through  <a href="http://www.sportscenteraltar.com/phrases/phrases.asp">  a collection of phrases used by the SportsCenter anchors</a>.  </p>
<p>  Almost makes me want to watch television.  </p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t watch broadcast TV, either.  I do watch commercial-free DVD sets, though.  That way, the program is the product, not me. (What does broadcast TV sell?  What&#8217;s its product?)  A small fig leaf, but there it is.</p>
<p>Anyway, I really like &lt;i&gt;The West Wing&lt;/i&gt;.  And, because I don&#8217;t watch things like ESPN, Mr. Mayne might have finally explained to me the following over-the-top outburst from the character Josh, the Deputy Chief-of-Staff:</p>
<p>&lt;i&gt;&quot;Victory is mine! Victory is mine! Great day in the morning, people, Victory is mine! I drink from the keg of glory! Donna, bring me the finest bagels and muffins in the land.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
