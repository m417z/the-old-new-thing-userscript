		<p>That reminds me of manual labor.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I accidentally deleted a critical file on my Commodore 64, and didn&#39;t notice until the directory entry itself had been overwritten &#8212; meaning there was no easy way to restore the file, nor even a guarantee the sectors themselves hadn&#39;t been overwritten. I busted out a disk monitor and scanned until I&#39;d found a bit in the middle of the file, then carefully tracing next &#8211; previous pointers across the disk on a sheet of paper until I&#39;d gotten the initial sector and the allocated sectors, which allowed me to recover my file.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t until much later that I realized I could have written a program to do this for me, given the sector in the middle. However, given my skills at the time (or lack thereof), it was dubious whether or not this would have actually saved time.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&#39;t a breakpoint in a dream be the moment you recognize it as a dream? I guess that would make lucid dreaming debugging (or at least tracing) the dream.</p>

		<p>In the olden days, I could get both a dump and a trace output to cards. &nbsp;That was on a 20k word (yes, 20k words) &quot;mainframe&quot;. &nbsp;That machine didn&#39;t even use an 8 bit byte. &nbsp;It used 12 bit slabs. &nbsp;In that 12 bit slab, one could store 3 4 bit digits or 2 6-bit alphas.</p>
<p>So, maybe your &quot;dream&quot; was real.</p>
<p>anyone know which machine I referenced?</p>

		<p>Over the weekend I dreamed that I got a letter telling me I had to join the army. Disconcerting given that I am definitely not soldier material (5AM is not actually a real time &#8211; the universe ceases to exist at 2AM, and doesn&#39;t pop into existence again until 7:30AM). Also disconcerting once I remembered that I live in the UK, which does not have National Service.</p>

		<p>But a breakpoint in a dream in a dream would not be discovered as being a dream, as the dream in a dream would be the one to take the focus. So you&#39;ll be on your way with your dream, without being disturbed. :)</p>

		<p>@ dave, yup. &nbsp;It was an NCR 315. &nbsp;I worked on those MANY years ago. &nbsp;The operator would actually deliver a dump in the form of cards to programmers in a tray. &nbsp;Maybe Raymond is much older than he lets on???? &nbsp; :)</p>

		<p>Haven&#39;t used punch card system, but does &quot;just placing half deck of cards&quot; equivalent to setting a breakpoint? How about using things like Blu-Tack to make sure the next card is stuck at the card feeder?</p>

		<p>Raymond, sorry to drag up an old post, but just wanted to thank you and let you know that &quot;Microsoft Money crashes&#8230;&quot; from November of last year just saved my sanity, and Money.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
