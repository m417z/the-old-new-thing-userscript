<p>
Smart quotes&mdash;you know, those fancy quotation marks that curl
&ldquo;like this&rdquo; &lsquo;and this&rsquo; instead of standing up straight
"like this" 'and this'&mdash;are great for text meant for humans to read.
Like serifs and other typographic details, they act as subtle cues
that aid in reading.
</p>
<p>
But don't let a compiler or interpreter see them.
</p>
<p>
In most programming languages, quotation marks have very specific meanings.
They might be used to enclose the text of a string, they might be used
to introduce a comment,
they might even be a scope resolution operator.
But in all cases, the language specification indicates that the role
is played by the quotation mark U+0022 or apostrophe U+0027.
From the language's point of view,
the visually similar characters U+2018, U+2019, and U+02BC (among others)
are completely unrelated.
</p>
<p>
I see this often on Web sites,
where somebody decided to "edit" the content to make it "look better"
by curlifying the quotation marks,
turning what used to be working code into a big pile of syntax errors.
</p>
<p>
I even see it in email.
Somebody encounters a crash in a component under development
and connects a debugger and sends mail to the component team
describing the
problem and including the information on how to connect to the debugger
like this:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=m><p>
WinDbg &ndash;remote npipe:server=abc,pipe=def
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Or maybe like this:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=m><p>
<a HREF="http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/0926da81-f03a-4986-959d-827b6753c22f1033.mspx">
Remote.exe</a> &ldquo;abc&rdquo; &ldquo;def&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And you, as a member of the team responsible for that component
copy the text out of the email (to ensure there are no transcription
errors) and paste it into a command line.
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; Remote.exe "abc" "def"
</pre>
<p>
and you get the error
</p>
<pre>
Unable to connect to server &ocirc;abc&ouml;
</pre>
<p>
What happened? You got screwed over by smart quotes.
The person who sent the email had smart quotes turned on in their
email editor,
and it turned "abc" into &ldquo;abc&rdquo;.
You then got lulled into a false sense of security by
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/02/13/371895.aspx">
the best fit behavior of
<code>WideCharToMultiByte</code></a>,
which says <i>I can't represent &ldquo; and &rdquo; in the console code page,
but I can map them to " which is a close visual approximation, so I'll
use that instead</i>.
As a result, the value you see on the command line shows straight quotes,
but that's just a fa&ccedil;ade behind which the ugly smart quotes
are lurking.
</p>
<p>
I've even seen people hoist by their own smartly-quoted petard.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
I can't seem to access a file called <code>aaa bbb.txt</code>.
The command
</p>
<p>
type &ldquo;aaa bbb.txt&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
results in the strange error message
</p>
<p>
The system cannot find the file specified.<br>
Error occurred while processing: "a.<br>
The system cannot find the file specified.<br>
Error occurred while processing: x.txt".
</p>
<p>
Why can't I access this file?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Somehow they managed to type smart quotes <i>into their own command line</i>.
</p>
<p>
So watch out for those smart quotes.
When you're sending email containing code or command lines,
make sure your editor didn't "make it pretty" and in the process destroy it.

		<p>The &quot;-&quot; is not the normal dash character. The dash is character Ox2D, while the one present here is 0x96.</p>
<p>This is obvious if you see the text in the hex view of Visual Studio, the character doesn&#8217;t even appear as a dash in there.</p>

		<p>&quot;PowerShell is a notable exception to this principle, for it treats all flavors of smart quotes and smart dashes as if they were dumb quotes and dumb dashes.&quot;</p>
<p>I hope every shell is eventually updated to do this. Or even better, uses smart quotes to make it easier to detect mismatched quotes like &quot;dfdfdf &quot;Dfdfdfd &quot;fdfdfd&quot;</p>

		<p>Everyone should turn of smart quotes until they get smarter. &nbsp;I&#8217;d much rather see &quot;dribble&quot; quotes and apostrophes than the plethora of backwards apostrophes that have plagued us in the past few years.</p>
<p>Even some of the big &quot;McCain &#8217;08&quot; signs at the Republican convention had the friggin&#8217; apostrophe backwards. &nbsp;Lately, I&#8217;ve seen quite a few of these wrong in recently-released novels.</p>
<p>&quot;Turn `em off,&quot; I say! ;-)</p>

		<p>Too helpful? &nbsp;Smart characters should be on by default in document suites that are designed for churning out human-readable stuff. &nbsp;If people can&#8217;t turn them off now, they certainly would never turn them on in the other case. &nbsp;And when producing good looking documents, you want the correct typographical characters.</p>
<p>That sounds like just the right amount of helpful.</p>
<p>Now since I regularly paste code snippets into design docs that I write in Word, I personally have turned off many auto-correct settings and I get along just fine. &nbsp;But it wouldn&#8217;t make sense to have all these features off by default.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know if there are really people who go and actively change the quotes to pretty-quotes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve had that changed me many times by software. I&#8217;m trying to remember when this happens. &nbsp;I think the WordPress editor does it, and I think if you use MS Word as your editor, it changes it for you as well. &nbsp;</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I disagree. &nbsp;It just takes one person to turn it on and send email with the pretty curly quotes, and then people will ask them how to do it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  apostrophe backwards
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this behavior started out because people don&#8217;t know how to defeat Word&#8217;s clever &quot;oh, this is an opening single-quote&quot; AI.</p>
<p>But the backwards leading apostrophe is reaching a level of penetration bordering on acceptable behavior.</p>

		<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t know if there are really people who go and actively change the quotes to pretty-quotes.&quot;</p>
<p>I sometimes do, &#8217;cause it looks better. In many of the web pages I maintain, I will insert the html entities for the curly quotes instead of &quot;. For a while I had the Unicode code points memorized. (Also for the en- and em- dash.)</p>
<p>The problem is that it screws up searching; if you &quot;properly&quot; typeset, for instance, &quot;doesn&#8217;t&quot;, the user won&#8217;t be able to actually use the browser&#8217;s find feature to search for it since the &#8216; won&#8217;t match.</p>
<p>I think more programs should take this into account so that I can do the right thing. I agree with Yuhong Bao.</p>
<p>(Though, I&#8217;m somewhat of a typographical snob; I&#8217;m a bit spoiled by Latex and the easy curly quotes, dashes, ligatures, etc.)</p>

		<p>Yuhong Bao,</p>
<p>Using smart quotes in the command prompt has a nasty problem though &#8211; these characters are legal in filenames. Would you like to have filenames which you can&#8217;t access from the command prompt? There are bound to be enterprising users out there who figured out that they can&#8217;t have quotes in their filenames, unless they copy them from word or outlook, when they seem to be allowed, so lets always do that. Then when you open the file from explorer, and the app or CreateProcess or whoever it is deals with quotes in command lines (I think it may even be the CRT) parses the command line and helpfully sorts out the smart quotes, then bam &#8211; the user can&#8217;t open their file.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never used powershell, so I don&#8217;t know how it deals with that.</p>

		<p>Handy tip: Changing the font used in the console from the default bitmap one to Lucida Console allows for smart quotes to appear correctly.</p>
<p>This is especially helpful when you consider that a file containing a smart double quote in its name is actually legal (it appears as a straight quote with the bitmap font)!</p>

		<p>&quot;Using smart quotes in the command prompt has a nasty problem though &#8211; these characters are legal in filenames.&quot;</p>
<p>People figured out how to deal with this problem four decades ago.</p>
<p>cmd.exe already has a method of escaping quotes: put two in a row. E.g. if &#8216;foo&#8217; prints argv[1], then</p>
<p>&nbsp;foo hello&quot;&quot;world</p>
<p>will print &#8216;hello&quot;world&#8217;. (Or something like that; maybe you have to put quotes around it.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason that you couldn&#8217;t do the same to escape curly quotes. Or, MS could ship a new shell that works more like the Unix shells, in that they actually allow real escape sequences; then you could put &quot; in file names too. (PowerShell may meet this criterion; I&#8217;m &nbsp;not sure.)</p>
<p>(Those of you who actually know how the command line is parsed will know I&#8217;m sort of lying there, because programs can actually see the literal command line. But if you use the CRT to parse the command line into the standard argc/argv, then you will get what I said.)</p>

		<p>&quot;Everyone should turn of smart quotes until they get smarter.&quot;</p>
<p>The problem there (at least for me) is that when I set up a machine for development, I have roughly 10 or so MAJOR tasks, taking upwards 8 hours to do (install Windows, update Windows, lock Windows down, install Office, install VS.Net, add MSDN, install AJAX, install XNA, update .Net, set up project locations, install TFS, set up source control workspace(s), etc. I have roughly twice as many &quot;minor&quot; tasks (on par with the quote setting), and it is REAL easy to forget any # of those.</p>
<p>Just a matter of priorities crossed with time.</p>

		<p>Word is very aggresive by default in converting quotes to smart quotes and double dashes to em-dashes. Since it&#8217;s the default editor for email when composing in HTML or RTF, it&#8217;s a constant issue for me. I&#8217;ll extrapolate from the sample size of 1 and claim that it&#8217;s the cause of most of these kinds of problems.</p>

		<p>&quot;From what I can tell, you have this guy to thank (or blame).&quot;</p>
<p>I choose&#8230; blame. &nbsp;What an awful idea, let&#8217;s hope this is a trend that dies a quick and painful death. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For starters, mismatching quotes in code even in the most reasonable font will be a nightmare to debug. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a slippery slope to making compilers smart about closing the quotes for you, adding in semicolons, and correcting your spelling in literals.</p>

		<p>It gets worse! Not only does the Microsoft Word replace straight quotes with smart quotes, Microsoft Outlook 2007 does as well, because by default Word is used as its text editor.</p>
<p>And not only does Word replace these characters, it does so using an extended ASCII range that makes it completely incompatible with UTF-8, the default character encoding for both HTML and XML.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/stupid-quotes" rel="nofollow">http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/stupid-quotes</a></p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not just the command line that gets messed up. It&#8217;s the entire Internet.</p>

		<p>&quot;For starters, mismatching quotes in code even in the most reasonable font will be a nightmare to debug.&quot;</p>
<p>PowerShell doesn&#8217;t distinguish between “ and ”; in other words, &#8216;foo “abc“&#8217; will work the same as &#8216;foo &quot;abc&quot;&#8217; and &#8216;foo “abc”&#8217;. So there&#8217;s no mismatching quotes any more than there is with straight ASCII quotes.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s a slippery slope to making compilers smart about closing the quotes for you, adding in semicolons, and correcting your spelling in literals.&quot;</p>
<p>What? Alarmist much?</p>

		<p>&#8220;somebody decided to &#8220;edit&#8221; the content to make it &#8220;look better&#8221; by curlifying the quotation marks&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The person who sent the email had smart quotes turned on in their email editor&#8221;</p>
<p>You frame it like people do this on purpose.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember a time when anyone intentionally replaced normal quotes with smart quotes in anything even resembling resembling code, or turned smart quotes on in their (email) editing program.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this is always due to editing programs making changes themselves, and having smart quote substitution turned on by default. Users generally have *failed to turn off* an arcane configuration option in order to get their editor to accept the keys they&#8217;re actually pressing on their keyboard.</p>
<p>Yup, two possible options. One is safe. The other breaks some things, but has the minor aesthetic advantages of making some text appear slightly prettier. Guess which is the default.</p>

		<p>Down with auto-‘smart’ even in apps like Word! It&#8217;s impossible to always choose the ‘correct’ quote/apostrophe character without higher-level understanding of the desired meaning of the text.</p>
<p>Instead, give us default keyboards that can type the smart quotes and other Unicode typographical niceties explicitly. The layout I&#8217;m using at the moment puts “‘&#8230;’” on AltGr+{[&#8230;]} (along with others) and is perfectly convenient to generate them when I need them, without butting in when I don&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>&quot;The solution here is not to cripple word processing software, it&#8217;s to not use word processing software to write code.&quot;</p>
<p>&#8212; That idea might seem reasonable, but it lasts about 10 seconds until someone sends a code snippet by e-mail, posts it to their blog, prints it in their PDF whitepaper, or the myriad of other places where auto-correcting editors come into play. Certainly no one sane would type their source code in a word processor, but the reality is that code gets copy-and-pasted from e-mails, blogs and magazines thousands of times a day.</p>
<p>Many times programmers won&#8217;t even notice what they did, especially when it&#8217;s a code snippet from their co-worker via e-mail. Many people don&#8217;t think of e-mail composition as a word processor yet most applications treat it as such.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not suggesting crippling word processors as the answer but it&#8217;s equally unreasonable to suggest that allowing code near a word processor is wholly avoidable, either. The only real solution is to be more aware of the problem. (Or perhaps to make the source code editors more aware of the problem and highlight the potential error!)</p>

		<p>I know how you feel bobince. I often turn auto-correct off and type my quotes with the ALT-codes instead.</p>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t even know you can do that though, much less have the punctuation codes memorized. I remember the first time my son saw me typing ALT-codes. He was so amazed, he immediately memorized the ASCII chart so he could type with the numeric keypad only without using the rest of the keyboard at all. Went to school and freaked all his teachers out because none of them knew you could do that, either. It was really funny.</p>

<p>&quot;Wordpress seems to change things like 0x54385894 into 0&#215;54385894. I don&#8217;t really see the point in that one.&quot;</p>
<p>I think it assumes by &#8216;x&#8217; you mean the multiplication sign &#8216;&#215;&#8217;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with just using &quot; or &#8216; ? It&#8217;s not harder to read, and before all this code page stuff came along we didn&#8217;t have any other quotes on computers. Didn&#8217;t harm us then, why would it harm us now?</p>

		<p>So many editors&#8211;including e-mail programs&#8211;do this automatically these days. I&#8217;ve gotten burned by it, and I&#8217;m well aware of the problem.</p>
<p>The worst part is most editors don&#8217;t convert smart quotes correctly even in a typographical context! Word, for example, converts *all* &quot;straight&quot; quotation marks to &quot;curly&quot; quotes regardless of context. This is incorrect. Straight quotes are actually numerical markers such as for inches and feet. Editors that encounter mid-sentence unmatched quotes following a number should leave them straight. There are other similar rules with em, en dashes and other punctuation that most editors screw up, too. As someone who spent many years hand-setting text this really aggravates me.</p>
<p>Auto-correcting editors haven&#8217;t really made homespun typography any better, they&#8217;ve just made it wrong in a different way. Aargh.</p>

<p>Oh, Please please please, can I have the compiler spellcheck my literals? My variable names too? Well, actually the IDE should do it rather than the compiler, and it would need some kind of smarts for CamelCase and underscores_as_spaces, but I would love this feature. No more embarrassing code review comments asking what a massageParser is.</p>

		<p>Somewhat similar irritation &#8211; people who refuse to email me a plain bitmap. They insist on pasting it into a Word document and sending that instead.

		<p>At least it&#8217;s easy enough to keep yourself from making that mistake. &nbsp;A while back I made a really simple program that just reloads whatever is in the clipboard as plaintext, and it corrects for all those curved quotes, em-dashes, etc., as well as stripping out all the formatting nonsense. &nbsp;Bind it to a global key, like Ctrl-Shift-V and just do that before pasting. &nbsp;I use it all the time now; way easier than looking for paste-special menu items or remembering how each application deals with rich text.</p>

		<p>I once got send code for a SQL select. Very simple because I&#8217;m not a programmer.</p>
<p>It was only finally when I sent the .mdb with the data stripped out that we realized why it worked for him but not for me. Yup, he had Word as his email editor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lost count of the times I&#8217;ve read about people complaining some forum software doesn&#8217;t show quotes. I tell them to cut and paste into the text box from Notebook not Word, but they still say it&#8217;s the newspaper/forum software that is wrong.</p>
<p>(Another common complaint is how the discussion forum software has a lousy American spell check. The forum software doesn&#8217;t have a spell check at all of course, it&#8217;s the default spell check that comes with Firefox (which incidentally has stopped working for the last two or three updates).</p>

		<p>Not going to discuss the pros and cons of smart-quotes, but I am confused by Dean&#8217;s comment that they use &quot;an extended ASCII range that makes it completely incompatible with UTF-8.&quot;</p>
<p>Unless I&#8217;m mistaken, we&#8217;re talking about characters in the U+2000 range, but UTF-8 can easily encode most of U+0000 to U+10FFFF, even restricted as it is by RFC 3629.</p>

<p>By &quot;extended ASCII range&quot;, he&#8217;s referring to the upper half of a codepage like 1252, and stating that it is &quot;completely incompatible with UTF-8&quot; because you have to go through the effort of actually /mapping/ the codepoints.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  There&#8217;s no reason that you couldn&#8217;t do the same to escape curly quotes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, it&#8217;s easier to do it for curly quotes than for normal double quotes, because existing programs are unaware of curly quotes, and so, accept them as normal command line input.</p>
<p>Usually, double quotes can be used to include space characters in a command line parameter.</p>
<p>some_command &quot;hello world&quot;</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m aware of at least TWO 32 bits hexadecimal editors not supporting this feature, making it IMPOSSIBLE to open files with space characters in their path, through the command line.</p>
<p>On the topic of smart quotes:</p>
<p>They&#8217;re bad on the Web, because of shared responsibilities involving buggy Web browsers, Web servers and Web scripts.</p>
<p>Typically:</p>
<p>A normal person copy text in Word and paste it in a text form on a Web page, including smart quotes.</p>
<p>The page is encoded in ISO-8859-1, and so, the Web browser figures that it must send a POST request with charset=ISO-8859-1.</p>
<p>Since the buggy browser thinks that ISO-8859-1 = Windows-1252, it sends code points used for control characters in ISO-8859-1 (between 0x80 and 0xA0).</p>
<p>The buggy Web server doesn&#8217;t validate input and store this buggy data in its data base, believing it&#8217;s valid ISO-8859-1.</p>
<p>Then, if the POST data appears on a Web page (e.g. a blog comment), it serves the page as ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8. At best, with ISO-8859-1, it serves Windows-1252 and claims it to be ISO-8859-1, which is ok with buggy Web browsers believing that ISO-8859-1 = Windows-1252. For UTF-8, it might mess up the thing, either deleting the characters, or not translating them (sending sort of Windows-UTF-8), or, if we&#8217;re lucky, properly translating them to UTF-8.</p>
<p>Things are so messy that, HTML5 actually REQUIRES Web browsers to assume that ISO-8859-1 = Windows-1252.</p>

<p>Whether the WHATWG can, cannot, should or shouldn&#8217;t require HTML clients to violate HTTP and ISO-8859 standards is another topic.</p>

		<p>@ulric and others: &nbsp;I was pasting a short piece of SQL code into an e-mail message using Outlook 2007, today, and since my message format is HTML by default, and uses Word as the editor, I had a heck of a time getting the quotes in the SQL to stay as straight quotes.</p>
<p>I could probably change the default for Word when it&#8217;s used as the e-mail editor and not when I&#8217;m creating a regular Word document, but I don&#8217;t happen to know how to change one setting without the other.</p>
<p>I occasionally need to underline something or make it RED and BOLD in an e-mail or risk having it overlooked; otherwise, I would use plain text e-mails.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
