<p>
Some time ago,
a configuration change was made to the Windows repo
that caused some people (such as me) to receive
hundreds of notifications a day
related to a process known as the <i>git train</i>.
</p>
<p>
The git train is a process which merges changes
between branches.
It gets its name from the concept of
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130820-00/?p=3453">
the train</a>.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, each time the git train did something,
which it does many many times a day,
I got an email notification from Visual Studio Team Services.
</p>
<p>
It took some work but I finally found the right people
to ask to stop sending me these notifications.
They promised to look into the problem and figure out
what happened that caused the system to start generating
tons of email notifications.
</p>
<p>
I suspected that most people in my situation had already
created a custom email rule to auto-delete these messages,
leading to another demonstration of
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20080416-00/?p=22723">
Le Chatelier's Principle for complex systems</a>:
"Every complex system resists its proper functioning."
</p>
<p>
Some computer system somewhere is expending a lot of time and
energy generating all the email notifications.
This causes a bunch of other computer systems to expend a lot
of time and energy to deliver those email notifications.
And then the recipient's computer system expends a lot of
time and energy to delete those email notifications.
</p>
<p>
In total,
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100223-00/?p=14843">
an awful lot of time and energy was spent to accomplish nothing</a>.
It's just two computer systems sending messages to each other,
with none of the messages ever being seen by a human being at any point.
</p>
<p>
I resisted the urge to do the same thing and create my own
custom rule to auto-delete the messages.
I allowed the messages to arrive in my inbox,
whereupon I deleted them.
This served as a reminder to me to pester the people in charge
to get them to fix their problem.
If everybody set up a rule to auto-delete the message,
the problem would never get fixed.</p>

		<p>(forwarding flood messages to those who can fix it&#8230;)<br />
It&#8217;s considered &#8216;negatively helpful&#8217; to do so.  In one particularly bad incident (&#8216;Bedlam DL 3&#8217;), people were fired for doing so.</p>

		<p>What a funny coincidence. A coworker just mentioned a similar problem today when her mail rules for “Visual Studio Team Services” weren’t working anymore as the sender changed to “Azure Devops”.</p>

		<p>All mail from Azure Devops (formerly VSTS) automatically goes to my spam box, because apparently it does not conform to some e-mail rules thing at Microsoft itself (or so a giant search engine which also has a mail service says).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
