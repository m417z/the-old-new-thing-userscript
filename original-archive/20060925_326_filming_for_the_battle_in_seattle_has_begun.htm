		<p>We need more zombie movies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, I&#8217;d like to take a moment to thank Canada for providing such a beautiful environment for filming low-budget sci-fi movies and show. &nbsp;Saturday wouldn&#8217;t be the same without you!</p>

		<p>Groundhog Day was filmed in some village in Minnesota, not Punxsy. &nbsp;I lived near there, and that town they showed in the film is nothing like Punxsy, excepting maybe the snow.</p>

		<p>My favorite was the &quot;X-Files&quot; movie. &nbsp;Dallas is shown as being surrounded by a desert with mountains visibly to the west of the city. &nbsp;Living in Dallas, I can tell you that while there are mountains in Texas to the west of Dallas, they are far enough away that you couldn&#8217;t see them even with a high-powered telescope due the curvature of the Earth.</p>

		<p>And &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is filmed in and around Cleveland, Ohio&#8211;not in Indiana. What&#8217;s mildly amusing is that the movie opens with an establishing shot of Cleveland&#8217;s Terminal Tower&#8211;apparently the filmmakers felt confident (correctly, I think) that Cleveland&#8217;s defining architectural piece would be unrecognizable to their audience.</p>

		<p>I remember hearing about those protests and being really upset. &nbsp;Pepper spray should never be used on someone if you can&#8217;t render medical assistance in a timely fashion. &nbsp;And yet there they were, using it on even the peaceful parts of the crowd&#8230;</p>

		<p>With all the tax incentives that the provincial BC government gives to movie makers, this doesn&#8217;t really come as any surprise. &nbsp;Vancouverites have become pretty blas&#233; about the whole thing.</p>

		<p>I thought the setting of Short Circuit 2 was most hilarious. &nbsp;When an immigrant said something about &quot;this country &#8217;tis of thee&quot; I thought he didn&#8217;t know what country he had immigrated to. &nbsp;Later in the movie it became apparent that the setting was supposed to be in the US, while efforts had obviously been made to show where the scenery really was instead of trying to disguise the scenery.</p>

		<p>I think the big question here is: &nbsp;how could the Seattle WTO demonstrations &amp; riots make for an even remotely interesting movie?</p>
<p>Maybe a documentary, but some sort of drama??</p>
<p>Oh my, some people got maced and some windows were broken&#8230; &nbsp;I&#8217;m on the edge of my seat!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing I&#8217;ll have to get the &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; seating arrangement to be able to sit through this movie. &nbsp;Or maybe they&#8217;ll add some snakes.</p>

		<p>&quot;Vancouver&quot;? &nbsp;Ha! &nbsp;Raymond, you misspelled &quot;Caprica City&quot;!</p>
<p>(Or did you mean to write &quot;Metropolis&quot;?)</p>
<p>Vancouver is the American (!) equivalent of the BBC Quarry, in which so many great British seventies and eighties science fiction TV shows were set. &nbsp;Blake&#8217;s Seven, Doctor Who&#8230; any time they needed an alien planet, it was off to the quarry to stumble round on grey rocks for a week or two. &nbsp;As a bonus, the Doctor&#8217;s companions found it much easier to twist their ankles when required!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
