		<p>Wow, that cleared everything right up for me! I never thought I would see a more cogent, decisive article on the web about this topic.</p>
<p>Also, I found it interesting that he spelled &quot;douchebag&quot; correctly in the comic, but intentionally spelled it &quot;dooshbag&quot; in the rest of the post.</p>

		<p>I thought I understood the difference before I read that, now I&#8217;m just confused and a little scared&#8230; :-|</p>

<p>OMG u r so idiot hahazhhahhaa i wil esplain</p>
<p>Well, the comic is Rory&#8217;s original work but the IRC log is all quotations.  IOW Rory knows how to spell but A/V Geek #2 does not.</p>

		<p>There are simpler definitions for males:</p>
<p>1024i: perfect for seeing every detail of Miss World.</p>
<p>720p: perfect for seeing the drops fo sweat falling off the face of a running fullback. But I still haven&#8217;t worked out why anyone would be interested in this&#8230;</p>
<p>The more pragmatic definitions are:</p>
<p>1024i: the cheap version of 1024p, whcih will be promoted as the next great thing for HD DVD a few years afer HD DVD is first released.</p>
<p>720p and 104i: what you won&#8217;t be able to watch on your new $1,000 21&quot; 19nnx1nnn display using Vista, unless you point a video camera at your new 15&quot; display and relay that to your real monitor. That will be cheaper than buying a new 21&quot; monitor. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear whether anyone will release a 6&quot; monitor with built in camera to make the compatibily solution more convenient. :)</p>
<p>Or you could just download whatever you&#8217;re trying to watch from the internet instead. It&#8217;ll probably be there within a day of first release or broadcast. :)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t feel so bad about the school kid article now &#8211; we are all doomed.</p>
<p>For anyone really curious, here is the executive summary:</p>
<p>1080i is the lower quality picture because doubling the lines over time does not double the perceived resolution over having all the lines on screen at once (only increases it by about 20% or so, IIRC).</p>
<p>On top of this, interlacing makes every thing that moves break up into &#8216;jaggies&#8217;, &#8216;ghosts&#8217; and &#8216;venetion blinds&#8217; effects, which is as annoying as hell.<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
