<p><a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/ycantpark/"> notorious for bad parking</a>, but they're not the only ones.</p>
<p> Microsoft has recurring parking problems as well, caused by office space shortages that force employees to be crammed into offices at double or even triple the intended density. Since parking lots are sized based on the expected number of cars, overstuffing a building with employees also results in an overstuffed parking lot. That's one of the reasons I ride my bicycle to work: There's always a place to park your bicycle.&sup1; </p>
<p> Occasionally, however, I do drive, and then I find myself hunting for parking like everybody else. One day I thought I spotted a space, only to find that a pick-up truck had decided to take up two spaces. I began to take pictures so I could file a report, when a white SUV drove past, a white SUV with <i>Security</i> written on it. </p>
<p> I caught the attention of the driver and pointed out the problem. </p>
<p> "Hi, this truck is parked in two spaces, and it doesn't have a parking permit either. Can you do anything about it?" </p>
<p> The driver replied, "You'll have to call security." </p>
<p> I was so not expecting that. </p>
<p> I was left speechless for a moment, then managed to reply, "<i>You're</i> security." </p>
<p> <b>Footnotes</b> </p>
<p> &sup1;Actually, that wasn't true ten years ago. Back then, the bike racks were full of bicycles that never moved, because a bicycle that never moves never loses its parking spot. Thankfully, the Real Estate and Facilities folks (known to insiders as RE&amp;F) have since instituted an annual "abandoned bicycle sweep" that ensures that the bike racks are used by people who actually ride their bicycles. </p>

		<p>He probably meant, by &quot;call security&quot;, something closer to, &quot;have the security operator handle it because, while is falls under security, it isn&#8217;t what I personally am in charge of.&quot;</p>
<p>Or maybe he&#8217;s just trying to shirk. Either way.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t get it. &nbsp;What&#8217;s the point of &#8216;reserving&#8217; a space by leaving a bike permanently parked in a rack?? &nbsp;You can&#8217;t use the bike!</p>

		<p>To get a bug fixed, we have to file a report. &nbsp;Just walking up to the programmer you might be responsible and beginning to blather on about a bug just isn&#8217;t done.</p>
<p>Perhaps &quot;calling security&quot; makes things happen through the proper channels as well.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve had a similar experience, probably in the same garage. I stopped a security vehicle to point out that a car was parked in the traffic lanes on the lowest level; would he please at least issue a ticket? He told me he couldn&#8217;t do that, because they only ticketed cars that were going to be towed, and a tow truck wouldn&#8217;t fit down there!</p>
<p>I see that parking vigilantes are now issuing their own tickets in the form of &quot;Certificates of Ineptitude&quot;.</p>

		<p>It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me at all if the vehicle turned out to be either his own personal vehicle, or a colleague&#8217;s; certainly here, our own security personnel seem to be the worst offenders, presumably because they know they won&#8217;t ticket each other however blatant the violation. Similarly, police vehicles often ignore traffic laws completely, even when they aren&#8217;t legally entitled to (speed limits, turn restrictions etc) &#8211; they&#8217;re only supposed to break those rules on emergency callouts with the lights and siren going, but who is actually going to catch and ticket them for it?</p>
<p>(On the other hand, they have indeed fined ambulances for speeding, for example when transporting organs for transplant: technically, because that isn&#8217;t an emergency *callout*, the speed limit still applies &#8211; so the fine stands.)</p>

		<p>If there was an &quot;Old New Thing&quot; of the rent-a-cop world it&#8217;s Raymond would have a long drawn out post explaining that anyone who thinks that this behavior is absurd is an IDIOT of the worst kind. &nbsp;He (our alternate universe Raymond) would taunt us with smug cries of, &quot;Well when they build a time machine we&#8217;ll be able to design the dispatch the way you want it. &nbsp;But for now we&#8217;ve got too many dollars invested and too much process designed around the current behavior.&quot;</p>
<p>Because OF COURSE it makes sense to require users of rent-a-cops to know the entire history of their industry when deciding if behavior is or is not currently reasonable. &nbsp;At least, that&#8217;s how alternate universe Raymond would see it.</p>

		<p>Raymundo Chennai:</p>
<p>You&#8217;re an idiot. If you can&#8217;t appreciate the information Raymond shares through this blog, feel free to learn more about the internals of Windows from slashdot. I hear Internet Explorer is integrated in the Windows Kernel.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like his tone or attitude, I doubt anyone&#8217;s forcing you to read these articles, so why do you subject yourself to Raymond&#8217;s posting style? Although, Raymond&#8217;s blog should be required reading for people like you, precisely because you think you&#8217;re smarter than the people at microsoft, but your posts indicate that you&#8217;re probably too stupid to figure out most of these things on your own.</p>
<p>Also, given that your latest post makes no sense and has no relevance whatsoever, I guess you&#8217;re just some nerd who likes trolling blogs to lessen their inferiority complex.</p>

		<p>@Not Norman Diamond: Please grow a sense of humor!</p>
<p>Seriously, I thought Raymond Chennai&#8217;s post was very funny. It was a not-so-subtle jab at Raymond&#8217;s posting style, not an all-out attack.</p>
<p>Channai never said he didn&#8217;t like this blog, nor did he say that he didn&#8217;t like the &quot;tone or attitude&quot;.</p>
<p>It was a simple but effective joke, showing that most people do things that others consider idiotic or jerk-like. Weather they be programmers, drivers, security personell or even blog commenters.</p>
<p>Calm down and get over it.</p>

		<p>The protocol is no worse than Microsoft&#8217;s protocol for fixing obvious bugs. Call support, talk to an idiot, elevate to a clueless, elevate to someone with half-clue. If you&#8217;re lucky, it will be fixed in the next OS that&#8217;s released in 3 years. In the process of fixing this bug, a subtler problem without a possible workaround will be introduced because someone was concerned that some crappy piece of retail code was dependent on that particular bug.</p>
<p>At least the security guy doesn&#8217;t ask you for your credit card before talking to you.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
