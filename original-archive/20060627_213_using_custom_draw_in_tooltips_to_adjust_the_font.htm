Last time, we looked at in-place tooltips</a>.
In that example, we finessed the font problem by
simply setting the destination font into the tooltip control.
We got away with that since we had only one tool.
But if you have multiple tools with different fonts,
then you can't set a font into the tooltip control and
expect it to work for every tool.
That's where custom draw comes in.
</p>
<p>
Start with the program from last time, but this time,
we'll set the font via custom-draw instead of setting it
globally.
</p>
<pre>
BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
 ...
 <font COLOR=blue><strike>// SetWindowFont(g_hwndTT, g_hfTT, FALSE);</strike></font>
 ...
}

<font COLOR=blue>LRESULT
OnTooltipCustomDraw(HWND hwnd, NMHDR *pnm)
{
 LPNMTTCUSTOMDRAW pcd = (LPNMTTCUSTOMDRAW)pnm;
 if (pcd-&gt;nmcd.dwDrawStage == CDDS_PREPAINT) {
  SelectFont(pcd-&gt;nmcd.hdc, g_hfTT);
  return CDRF_NEWFONT;
 }
 return 0;
}</font>

LRESULT
OnNotify(HWND hwnd, int idFrom, NMHDR *pnm)
{
 if (pnm-&gt;hwndFrom == g_hwndTT) {
  switch (pnm-&gt;code) {
  <font COLOR=blue>case NM_CUSTOMDRAW:
   return OnTooltipCustomDraw(hwnd, pnm);</font>
  case TTN_SHOW:
   return OnTooltipShow(hwnd, pnm);
  }
 }
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
Of course, doing this is overkill in our case where we have
only one tool,
so you'll have to imagine that the tooltip is managing
multiple tool regions, each with a different font.
When we get the <code>NM_CUSTOMDRAW</code> notification,
we respond to the <code>CDDS_PREPAINT</code> stage by
changing the font and returning the <code>CDRF_NEWFONT</code>
flag (which is necessary when changing the font).</p>

		<p>Thank you for publishing your code examples. They are really always very instructive.</p>
<p>I tried them on W2K, and saw something that I can&#8217;t explain: even without TTS_NOANIMATE, sometimes the tooltip was drawn without animation and border (at least I believe it&#8217;s a tooltip since it&#8217;s yellow). And with that flag, it&#8217;s always without animation and border. But whenever it&#8217;s drawn without border, the window is clipped to the parent (when I resize the partent window).</p>
<p>Is it possible to eliminate animation and still have tooltip that is not clipped? I hope it&#8217;s not a W2K specific problem. Thanks.</p>

		<p>I found that using WS_EX_TOPMOST instead of WS_EX_TRANSPARENT gives a consistent, black border around the tooltip. &nbsp;If I combine the two, the border disappears on W2K. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t think WS_EX_TRANSPARENT is useful anyway since the tooltip already relay mouse messages to the parent&#8217;s window (as specified by TTF_TRANSPARENT).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
