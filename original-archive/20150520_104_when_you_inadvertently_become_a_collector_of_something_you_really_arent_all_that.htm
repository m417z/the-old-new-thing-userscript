<p>As I was heading home at the end of the day, I ran into one of my colleagues who was also going home, and he was carrying a <i>Star Wars</i>-themed metal lunchbox similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007COUJNA/?tag=tholneth-20"> this one</a>. For those who didn't grow up in the United States, these metal lunchboxes are the type of things elementary school children use to carry their lunch to school.</p>
<p> I remarked, "Nice lunchbox." </p>
<p> My colleague explained, "Yeah, I sort of ended up as the lunchbox guy. It started when somebody gave me a lunchbox as a semi-humorous gift, and I kept it on my shelf. Then other people saw that I had a metal lunchbox and concluded, 'Oh, he must collect metal lunchboxes,' and they started giving me metal lunchboxes. And before I knew it, I became an unwitting collector of metal lunchboxes." </p>
<p> The same thing happened to a different colleague of mine. As his first birthday after he got married approached, his new in-laws asked his wife, "What does Bob like?" </p>
<p> His wife shrugged. "I dunno. He kind of likes Coca-Cola?" </p>
<p> That year, he got a vintage Coca-Cola serving tray. The next year, he got a Coca-Cola clock. And then Coca-Cola drinking glasses. And so on. </p>
<p> Eventually, he had to  ask his wife to tell her family, "Okay, you can stop now. Bob doesn't like Coca-Cola <i>that</i> much." </p>

		<p>I&#39;m not much into giving or receiving gifts, but my sense is that one should probably figure out what&#39;s _missing_ (and is likely to remain missing forever) in the target home. Of course, the missing item should also be something that the person might actually like if exposed to by someone else.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m a casual collector of The Lord of the Rings stuff, too. I do love Tolkien&#39;s work, and people keep gifting me all sorts of related things, like One Rings (there was only one of them, right?), figures from the movies, or various objects with Tolkien&#39;s anagram in them. Once, someone gifted me a book titled &quot;Tolkien for Dummies&quot; &#8211; I think that was at the time I had just finished reading the Silmarillion for the second time. I don&#39;t think I have even opened it.</p>
<p>Going off topic, the good thing about writing a tech blog is that your readers can follow your links even when you make a mistake with them :-) .</p>

		<p>Historically I&#39;ve been a TRS80&gt;Tandy&gt;Windows guy, but fifteen years ago someone gave me an old compact mac and I put it on my desk. Pretty soon, they were coming out of closets cause &quot;Jim likes those old macs.&quot; Pretty soon, my wife had to tolerate &quot;the evolution of the compact mac&quot; on our fireplace mantel instead of normal wife stuff. I found that more than 3 don&#39;t stack well for storage. Seriously, I had over 100 of them when I had to move&#8230; What do you do with these things? &nbsp;I contemplated burying them in the crawlspace! I kept a few &quot;interesting ones&quot; and put an ad on Craigslist: &nbsp;1 mac for 1 premium beer, all you can haul. (Quite the discount from the original sales price) &nbsp;I ended up with a lot of easily disposable beer and also scientifically determined that an Isuzu Trooper can (uncomfortably) hold 43 compact macs.</p>

		<p>For me it is Beatles junk by proxy. I do have most of their music and I enjoy it, but I have other artists that I enjoy far more. My children, on the other hand, latched onto a few of their songs and became huge Beatles fans. Everyone made the inference that they could only become Beatles fans because I am and started giving me Beatles junk. And trust me, there is a lot of Beatles junk for sale out there and I very deliberately use the word junk.</p>

		<p>Even though I may not be into Coke that much, if someone started giving me vintage stuff, I wouldn&#39;t complain to much. &nbsp;Some of the old Star Wars and Coca-Cola merchandise from years ago is worth a lot of money now.</p>

		<p>Sometimes this idea can work out in your favor. &nbsp;A few years ago my sig other and I let it be know to the extended family that we both like craft beer. &nbsp;For every Christmas that followed, we usually received one or two bottles, growlers, or beer mugs from the fam. &nbsp;Believe me, we have not complained : )</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also seen the down side of this effect. &nbsp;Years earlier my mom asked me what I like for Christmas. &nbsp;I replied that I like history books and baseball. &nbsp;Now, for every birthday and Christmas, I get a deluge history- and baseball-related books every year (sadly, no game tickets). &nbsp;Occasionally some of the titles turn out to be interesting, but most of them sit on my shelf until I get a chance to put them into the book donation bin.</p>

		<p>When I was travelling for work, one of my co-workers asked me to pick them up a shot glass from the airport. The co-worker ended up leaving before I could give it to them, so I kept it. Kind of a neat keepsake for the places I travelled to. After that, I started buying them from every airport I went through. My parents knew of my collection and when they came back from a roadtrip, I had 20 new shotglasses for my collection. I didn&#39;t have the heart to tell them I wasn&#39;t collecting shot glasses, I was collecting memories of my travels.</p>

		<p>Too bad I am not in the kind of environment where people do this, otherwise I would be telling everyone that &quot;I love LEGO&quot; and have everyone gift me LEGO :)</p>
<p>Of course they would probably get me useless crap (things that look like LEGO but aren&#39;t LEGO, things that are LEGO but that I already have, things that are LEGO but that I have no use for, old used LEGO that isn&#39;t good enough for the collection etc)</p>

		<p>I bought a cheap, deactivated training hand grenade off Ebay and put it on my desk several years ago (It&#39;s the &quot;blame grenade&quot; for when someone breaks the build). My coworkers saw it and now, years later, I have an impressive arsenal of replica training Mills bombs, Stielhandgranates, pineapple grenades, lemon grenades, &quot;baseball&quot; grenades, rifle grenades, flash bangs, and smoke grenades.</p>

		<p>Old guy, loved the Giants. Went to over 500 games ( over 45 years ), at one of his first games, saw this offer for Mr Peanut Promotional items. Over the years, collected so much stuff, that he gave away boxes of it at the New Years Day Party. Wish I still had the Mr Peanut Pencil he gave me.</p>
<p>He, oh my, looked like he was wearing those fuzzy eyebrow glasses. He put on a pair, and no one knew he was wearing them.</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
