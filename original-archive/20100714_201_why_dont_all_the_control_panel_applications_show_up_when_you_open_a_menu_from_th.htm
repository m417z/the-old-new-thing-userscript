<p>One of the features added to the Explorer Address Bar in Windows Vista is the ability to navigate quickly to an item by clicking on its name, or navigate to a folder's children by clicking the arrow that appears next to the item and selecting your destination. <img width="416" height="244" src="http://www.microsoft.com/library/media/1033/windows/images/windows-vista/features/3.02ExplorerAddress.jpg"></p>
<p> One customer reported that there appeared to be a problem with the Control Panel: Switch to Classic View, and then click the arrow next to the words <i>Control Panel</i>. The result is a dropdown menu that shows some but not all of the Control Panel applications. Is this a bug? </p>
<p> No, everything is behaving normally. Recall that the dropdown menu shows things that you can navigate to; in other words, it shows you a list of subfolders of the Control Panel. Since you can't navigate to non-folders, they aren't listed as options. </p>
<p> Notice, for example, that when you go to your <i>Documents</i> folder and click the dropdown arrow, not all of your documents show up in the menu. Only things which Explorer can navigate to appear in the menu (mostly subfolders but occasionally you'll find subfolder-like items such as compressed folders). </p>
<p> The customer replied with a simple, "Thanks. That makes sense." </p>

		<p>Of course, the navigability of the folder is a necessary but insufficient criterion for appearance on that drop-down. For example, Network and Sharing Center isn&#39;t on it &#8211; instead, it&#39;s in the All Control Panel Items subfolder of Control Panel. Or at least that&#39;s where it shows up if you got there by clicking on the links, rather than navigating via the drop-downs.</p>
<p>Similarly, Network Connections isn&#39;t on it &#8211; logically enough, it&#39;s somewhere completely different, in the Network and Internet subfolder. But wait! Network Connections doesn&#39;t show up in Network and Internet&#39;s drop-down! It&#39;s navigable, but you need to get there by clicking on the link &quot;Change adapter settings&quot; from Network and Sharing Center, which is itself a subfolder of Network and Internet, but only if you got there by navigating from the drop-downs&#8230;</p>

		<p>So why is Control Panel in Windows 7 limited to Category, and Small/Large icon (which is actually Tiles) views? Why restrict Large icons, Extra Large, List and Details views? Can&#39;t resist that &quot;restrict something&quot; urge? &quot;Large icons&quot; isn&#39;t sufficient for 1080p and above resolutions. Or maybe Start search is so evolved that MS wants to force us to only use it?</p>

		<p>anynomous: bingo!</p>
<p>One problem with windows search 4.0 is it&#39;s so intrusive and burning CPU cycles it&#39;s unbelievable (check with ProcMon). It&#39;s supposed to index everything and satisfy it&#39;s curiosity after some time, but it doesn&#39;t ever. A huge regression. This is one of the rare areas where Vista is better than 7.</p>
<p>Sad really.</p>

		<p>It may &#39;make sense&#39; from a developer&#39;s point of view. The user/customer, however, doesn&#39;t care about subfolders in the control panel: he clicks on that tab because he OBVIOUSLY wants a list of CP applications. You&#39;re telling him &#39;BZZZZZZZZTTT! Wrong choice! Those are not FOLDERS, you idiot!&#39;.</p>
<p>Sorry, but explanation not accepted.</p>

		<p>BBZZZT, sorry, idiot rant not accepted.</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t tell the difference between a &quot;tab&quot; and an &quot;arrow&quot;, then you&#39;re dumber than the users you claim to be advocating for.</p>
<p>If you click on the folder name, you jump straight to that folder. If you click on the arrow *beside* the folder name, you get a list of child folder that you can go to immediately.</p>

<p>Explorer already seems to have special knowledge of the control panel. &nbsp;Why shouldn&#39;t it be consistent between the main view and the breadcrumb bar?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a can of worms that you can close with tons of code, mostly replicating an existing user interface in another place. Or you can keep the lid on it.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
