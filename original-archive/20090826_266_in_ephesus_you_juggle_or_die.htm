<p> In 1987, <a href="http://www.fkb.com/"> The Flying Karamazov Brothers</a> performed their interpretation of Shakespeare's <i>A Comedy of Errors</i>. When I watched this show (<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2702592702804198144">part&nbsp;1</a>, <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8492497755937114017"> part&nbsp;2</a>) when it first aired, it was my introduction both to the juggling team and to the play. It also reinforced my impression that Shakespeare was meant to be performed and not merely read. The jokes simply don't work as well when you merely read them. </p>
<p> For some reason, I still remember the tiny juggling mishap in the final seconds of the show (part&nbsp;2, time code 1:05:14): The actress at the far left edge of the screen (Luciana) drops a pin but covers up the mistake nicely. </p>

		<p>It is a bit unfortunate that the sound quality of the video is somewhat low; if I hadn&#8217;t been acquainted with the plot before, I&#8217;m sure I wouldn&#8217;t be able to follow what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>Regarding &quot;meant to be performed&quot;: that made me think of Lord Vetinari who prefers reading tablature to orchestral performance.</p>

		<p>Funny &#8212; I saw the timestamp, but not the suggestion to look to the far left. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are actually two pins dropped around the same time. &nbsp;The pair in the middle also miss one when the woman on the left drops one.</p>

		<p>I wonder if stage performers rehearse for bloopers. Does the director occaisionally tell a juggler throw wide just so everyone has practice with, um, exceptional cases?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
